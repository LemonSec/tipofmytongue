00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:07,049
good afternoon today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,320
about broadband internet performance and

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,790
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> refer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measure it from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway</font>

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,500
I'm a fourth-year PhD student at georgia

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,730
tech I work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> professor Nick feemster</font>

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,170
and this is joint work with University

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,170
of Napoli and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of Paris</font>

8
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:26,070
broadband usage is proliferating around

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,590
the world they were estimated<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more</font>

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,750
than 500<font color="#E5E5E5"> million users at the end of</font>

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,690
2010 and this number<font color="#E5E5E5"> is projected to</font>

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,280
grow in the future so naturally<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,250
a lot of interest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing how these</font>

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,210
networks actually perform access ISPs

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,219
are interested in knowing what

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,350
performance the customers are seeing and

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,050
whether they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better visibility</font>

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,820
into the into the access network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,489
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will help reduce service</font>

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,899
calls content providers are interested

21
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,120
in knowing whether the optimizations

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,789
that they do to routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and traffic</font>

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,149
engineering actually delivers a better

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,050
user experience consumers and regulators

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,960
they're also interested in knowing

26
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:08,360
whether exercise fees actually deliver

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:12,450
on their promises however actually

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,369
measuring home networks is not easy as a

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,340
motivating example considered throughput

30
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,080
measurement in a typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> home network</font>

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,299
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have multiple devices that connect</font>

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the gateway device through the wire</font>

33
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,460
or the wireless interface we profiled

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,140
one such user in Atlanta an AT&T dsl

35
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,880
user with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 megabits per second down</font>

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,540
and five<font color="#CCCCCC"> pearl kilobits per second our</font>

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">from through the wireless network and we</font>

39
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,720
saw that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this user was getting 4.4</font>

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,619
megabits per second down and 140

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,240

neutralizer test from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Berkeley and we</font>

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,360
saw 4.8 megabits was<font color="#E5E5E5"> second down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and 4</font>

44

30 kilo bits per second up as you can

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,929
see these<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only different</font>

46
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,399
from each other but they're also quite

47
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,270
different from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual service plan</font>

48
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> caesar is supposed to be getting</font>

49
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,079
the reasons for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are many the most</font>

50
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,699
important ones are that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not</font>

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">continuous measurements these are not my</font>

52
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,269
numbers that you obtain over a period of

53
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,089
time this is a single snapshot of

54
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,380
state of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network at that time period</font>

55
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're also affected by confounding</font>

56
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,710
factors in this case the wireless

57
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:26,590
network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also any possible cross</font>

58
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,300
traffic in the home network so we

59
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,040
propose that these measurements we

60
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,250
conducted directly from the home router

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,989
itself we instrumented a home gateway

62
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,930
and we deployed it in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> user's home</font>

63
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:40,030
over a period of one month and we saw an

64
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,600
average of 5.6 megabits per second down

65
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,370
and 460 kilobits per second up this

66
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">number tallies more closely with the</font>

67
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,580
service plan rate so doing measurements

68
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,040
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway enables periodic</font>

69
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,420
measurements continuous periodic

70
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,799
measurements and it can also account for

71
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,589
confounding factors it takes the

72
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,880
wireless network out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the picture and</font>

73
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,120
it can also account for cross traffic

74
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,960
inside the home so we present<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

the home network such and it and it

86
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,260
measures metrics like throughput latency

support the netgear 3700 router but we

have plans to support other platforms

the second down plan

107
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,159

117
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,340
that the multi-threaded test shows us

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:54,199
about 2.6 megabits per second down and

<font color="#E5E5E5">the single threaded test gives us about</font>

possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just the power boost numbers</font>

130
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,199
we also do latency measurements we

210
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:48,310

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,209
and the box comes ipv6 capable so it's

00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:59,930
pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> a plug-and-play router in</font>

220
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:21,260
so we profile three users in Atlanta<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

221
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,589
the y axis shows the instantaneous

222
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:27,680
throughput and x axis shows time so what

223
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,290
we see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that user want has a peak</font>

224
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,910
throughput rate of about 18.5 megabits

225
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:36,319
per second which drops down to about

226
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:38,120
12.5 after about 14 seconds another user

227
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,110
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlanta see something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> similar but</font>

228
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,820
sees two different peaks and it comes

229
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,480
down to the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term throughput</font>

230
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,709
value but the third user sees a

231
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,180
different week too so these are

232
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:52,849
different service plans<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe in</font>

233
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,770
comcast and<font color="#CCCCCC"> comcast offers this as a</font>

234
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,579
service called power boost so power

235
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:00,470
boost is implemented using token buckets

236
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:02,060
interestingly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> volume of the the</font>

237
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,740
bucket<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's used for all these three</font>

238
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">users is very similar about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

239
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,209
megabytes so also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> short-term</font>

240
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,610
throughput is significantly different

241
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:14,149
from the sustainable throughput so what

242
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:17,120
this means is that although the benefits

243
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:18,950
are very good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> short-term sessions</font>

244
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,290
like web browsing if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

245
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,910
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term file transfer what you're</font>

246
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,949
going to see is the long-term<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughput</font>

247
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,279
which is about 12 megabytes megabits per

248
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,170
second so here's a look at last my

249
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:34,550
latency so for this we use data

250
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:37,279
collected from the San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Luis FCC study so</font>

251
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,199
what we show here is a histogram of the

252
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">baseline lost my latencies are seen by</font>

253
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:45,770
customers of these different ISPs so the

254
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,870
y axis shows the percentage of users in

255
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,870
that is be that have a baseline latency

256
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,940
within this within a particular bin what

257
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,670
we see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that these cable is peace</font>

258
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,490
most of the customers of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC</font>

259
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:01,459
pretty low plasma Layton sees less than

260
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,260
10 milliseconds however the picture

261
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,219
looks slightly different for dsl is

262
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">peace</font>

263
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,870
actually have a significant fraction of

264
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,790
users<font color="#CCCCCC"> that see much higher last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

265
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:15,050
Layton sees and we saw users with<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

266
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">my latencies of greater</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than 40</font>

267
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,030
milliseconds so dsl<font color="#E5E5E5"> asthma latencies can</font>

268
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,550
be high and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

269
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:25,040
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this is that dsl is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peace</font>

270
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,380
employ a technique called dsl

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,339
interleaving on the last mile which is a

272
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,170
technique not which which reduces laws

273
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,380
in the last mile by adding more error

274
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,719
correction techniques so while this does

275
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,090
have an effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> in reducing loss it</font>

276
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:46,610
unfortunately has a side effect of

277
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:49,310
increasing latency so<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally we look at</font>

278
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:55,520
another case study look at modem buffers

279
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:59,000
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> home-home in home networks so we</font>

280
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,939
profiled the buffering in modems by by

281
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,940
running a latency test a ping to the

282
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,860
last mile server both while then the

283
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">while there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no traffic in the network</font>

284
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,770
and while then uplink<font color="#E5E5E5"> is saturated so</font>

285
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,260
the experiment ran as follows so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ran</font>

286
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:18,740
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying for 30 seconds and then we</font>

287
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:23,060
saturated<font color="#CCCCCC"> the uplink using I perv for 60</font>

288
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:26,060
seconds so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an 18-2 AT&T dsl user</font>

289
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,920
and the modem used was to wire what we

290
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,709
saw here was the baseline latency is

291
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,229
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 milliseconds and at 30 seconds</font>

292
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:36,410
when we saturated the uplink the latency

293
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,960

294
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,790
the y-axis is log scale so we swapped

<font color="#CCCCCC">ten seconds I don't think I need to say</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> at these Layton sees the home</font>

302

303
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:06,349
the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> part is that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

304
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,420
easy to induce these effects all you

305
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,400
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is have some user in your</font>

questions questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi I'm Amy elkin</font>

364
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:57,739
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Centrelink when you were measuring</font>

365
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:00,469
the six meg at AT&T probably you were

366
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,830
measuring at the IP layer yes so there

367
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:07,270
is probably overhead yes but I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

368
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,960
that with AT&T dsl the modem actually

369
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,699
synchronizes that it slightly higher

370
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,220
rate than the service<font color="#CCCCCC"> planned right so I</font>

371
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,840
think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that should take care of</font>

372
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,710
it but yeah and then another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about</font>

373
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:22,700
the latency what matters is when latency

374
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:25,070
impacts gaming or VoIP and so the levels

375
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,470
you were showing for dsl weren't high

376
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:31,040
enough to really impact that but if they

377
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:34,820
exceed that yes well this is anecdotal

378
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,420
but I've seen discussions in some forums

379
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:40,250
where people move to us and they didn't

380
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,569
expect a jump in the latency because of

381
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,730
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue you know it's a shock you</font>

382
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,200
know you think you're upgrading but you

383
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:52,190
actually get high latency with higher

384
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:55,340
throughput yes so people do care<font color="#CCCCCC"> bend</font>

385
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">ranks medias arm have you looked at</font>

386
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,940
using passive measurement techniques

387
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,490
looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

388
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,500
through the modem now we have discussed

389
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,189
that however there is significant

390
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,230
privacy concerns so one thing that we're

391
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:12,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at is to get explicit permission</font>

392
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,020
from the user if they're willing for us

393
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,430
to do passing measurements and then

394
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,780
deploy passing measurements on a subset

395
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,780
of these deployments yes

396
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:27,220
anybody else

397
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,220
very good thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much</font>
