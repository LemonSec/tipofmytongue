1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,629
thank you very much good morning

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,950
everybody my name is Rob and I'm gonna

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,610
be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you about what open flow</font>

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,309
is and where it's going so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a recent</font>

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,669
industry blog actually likened me to

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,259
being the kool-aid man<font color="#E5E5E5"> of open flow I'm</font>

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,029
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually here to try to get you guys</font>

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,350
to drink<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kool-aid I mean don't get</font>

9
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,970
me wrong it's very good you know I made

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,460
it myself but it unfortunately you for

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">better for worse open flows got a lot of</font>

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,399
hype around it and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the purpose</font>

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,600
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk is for me to actually try</font>

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give you a good solid technical</font>

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,520
background as to what open flow is and

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,430
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be used for so with that</font>

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,930
in mind I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be going through</font>

18
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,910
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the backgrounds and problems</font>

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,800
that open flow is trying to solve what

20
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,419
open flow is itself and you know the

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,610
short answer there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> open flows an API</font>

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,910
if that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take from this talk</font>

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,469
that that's enough given this API I'm

24
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,940
going to give you some example use cases

25
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,340
of why it might be useful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in your</font>

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,839
network I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,559
standardization efforts that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,909
on it actually has a specif<font color="#CCCCCC"> anders body</font>

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,560
the open networking foundation

30
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,850
specifically towards standardizing it

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,220
and there's already been some

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,210
interoperability work going on and last

33
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,530
going to talk about you know the

34
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,880
deployment and people have started

35
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,140
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adopt this thing so before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,170
get started into the talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a little</font>

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,939
bit of a disclaimer most of this talk is

38
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,710
about other people's ideas open flow is

39
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,899
actually a fairly big movement and I'm

40
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one speaking here today there</font>

41
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a bunch of professors involved a</font>

42
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,939
bunch of startups involved all sorts of

43
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,049
company and even this<font color="#E5E5E5"> new standards body</font>

44
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:39,360
specifically about me I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working</font>

45
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,560
on open flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say in the trenches I've</font>

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,610
been doing coding I've been doing

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,799
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been working in this</font>

48
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,170
Andrews body for about three years now

49
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,810
I'm currently working for an open flow

50
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,670
based startup big switch networks but

51
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,530
I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this talk with my open</font>

52
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,869
flow evangelist hat on this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

53
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a company talking anyway and you</font>

54
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,399
know kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess with all the talks</font>

55
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,630
here you the opinions represented here

56
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,040
don't necessarily represent those of the

57
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,298
company but<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the big question is you</font>

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,530
what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that open flow</font>

59
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,940
solves and you know if you talk to

60
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,038
vendors here today or you talk to

61
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,910
anybody we have lots of solutions right

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,489
you know what's the problem that we

63
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,150
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

64
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,590
for if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look across you know the the</font>

65
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,790
set of layers that we have the sense of

66
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,500
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you can</font>

67
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost you know Chinese menu style pick</font>

68
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,610
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the solutions that you want</font>

69
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,109
you if you want virtualization and layer

70
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,970
to you can use vlans if you want

71
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,340
virtualization layer 3 but mpls we've

72
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,020
got vrf<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of go through</font>

73
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,670
this chart and you imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> filling in</font>

74
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,650
all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things is obviously very</font>

75
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,149
incomplete that there are all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

76
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,040
solutions here what's the problem that

77
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,540
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have well the problem is that</font>

78
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,459
actually most people have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of these</font>

79
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems and then you end up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having to</font>

80
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,360
implement a lot of these solutions and

81
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,350
so what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really almost kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of want</font>

82
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,600
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution to the solutions and so if</font>

83
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way the argument</font>

84
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,799
is the complexity itself is the problem

85
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know so we've been having</font>

86
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,300
effectively a new solution for every

87
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,120
problem for about 20 years now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

88
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,490
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks are actually very complex</font>

89
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,930
and you if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your 20 years</font>

90
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,280
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've had right now in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of</font>

91
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,860
complexity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and different standards in</font>

92
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,270
different implementations do you think

93
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,580
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could handle another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 more years of</font>

94
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,830
this at what point do we get to a point

95
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,810
where our networks can't actually

96
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,880
managed by humans who can only keep so

97
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,680
many things in their heads at once you

98
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,440
know at what point is this is this a

99
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,060
problem and the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the insidious</font>

100
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,890
part of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the comp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X the</font>

101
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,170
complexity feeds on to itself it really

102
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,640
compounds that is to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font>

103
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,989
managing multiple layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

104
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you have multiple things that are</font>

105
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,110
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in each one of these layers</font>

106
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,109
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost have this complex kind of</font>

107
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cartesian product of just complex</font>

108
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,510
solution spaces that you have to manage

109
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,010
and you know this talking to this group

110
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel like telling</font>

111
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,980
you that the the sky is blue in to see

112
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,109
is the green I mean you know these

113
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the bottom line is the</font>

114
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,340
complexity<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs money so it costs money</font>

115
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,470
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of taking longer to qualify new</font>

116
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,060
features and deploy them and it takes it

117
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs longer in terms of trying to debug</font>

118
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,930
your network when there is a problem

119
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,570
and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the big question is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

120
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,390
sure the networks are<font color="#CCCCCC"> complexity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I knew</font>

121
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,430
that what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do about it and so I</font>

122
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,620
give you to kind of high-level answers

123
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,079
one is we can find better abstractions

124
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,730
we can find ways of representing the

125
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,919
network in slightly different simplified

126
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,060
ways you know to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know when we're</font>

127
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">making a config change you the</font>

128
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,990
individual config changes are less

129
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,820
complex you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can stop solving the</font>

130
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,730
same problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> in slightly different ways</font>

131
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,469
at different layers and you when we're

132
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,060
solving a bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems we</font>

133
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">can try to extract the commonality among</font>

134
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,550
the solutions another way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

135
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,010
reduce complexity is to reduce the

136
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,180
number of management touch points yeah

137
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,770
that is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make</font>

138
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,380
a config change make it in fewer places

139
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,640
and you that this again is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

140
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,680
intuitive I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are already</font>

141
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,539
paying lots of money for these big multi

142
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,860
chassis systems and there's a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

143
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,050
it you know it's much easier to manage

144
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,360
one box that's logically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole bunch</font>

145
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,240
of one logical box then a whole bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,340
smaller boxes in its place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

147
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,170
we've seen this in other paradigms you

148
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,789
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCE in what have you that you</font>

149
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,770
really you're decoupling<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control</font>

150
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,390
from the forwarding you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have fewer</font>

151
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,049
management management touch points than

152
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,820
you have forwarding notes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

153
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,530
sure abstraction sounds like a neat idea

154
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,020
but what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually mean in</font>

155
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,059
practice so if you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of look inside a</font>

156
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,950
router you know the names<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

157
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,480
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> change vendor by vendor and you</font>

158
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,669
know depending on the model these things

159
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,960
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> but logically you have something</font>

160
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's does some sort of routing</font>

161
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,210
computation and then you have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

162
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,800
line cards and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a protocol</font>

163
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,320
you say bgp that makes an announcement

164
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,600
you know so i can reach this network

165
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,340
address on this interface you know what

166
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,040
happens is that message comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a line</font>

167
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,359
card and it gets punch it up to the the

168
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,280
routing engine or whatever you want to

169
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">call it you know some level some amount</font>

170
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">of computation happens you know there's</font>

171
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,919
some routing recomputation that happens

172
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,840
and the decisions made and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision</font>

173
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,710
is pushed down into the line cards in

174
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:08,039
terms of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FIB and then so once this</font>

175
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,349
decision is in place then packets can

176
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,120
flow so now when package show up

177
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,790
matching<font color="#E5E5E5"> this IP prefix we can actually</font>

178
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,020
make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the right direction and</font>

179
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,660
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> critical thing is you this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

180
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same process for mpls if</font>

181
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,160
these were<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp messages this is the same</font>

182
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,840
ospf is is and you know if you want to

183
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">call the the routing engine a supervisor</font>

184
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,229
module and say that this was actually a

185
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,289
spanning tree message it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the same</font>

186
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,660
for for switching there's actually this

187
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,680
very similar process going on for a lot

188
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,240
of the protocols that we're talking

189
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,160
about here so there's a control message

190
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,900
there's some routing computation and

191
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,130
then has it changed the forwarding entry

192
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:47,560
and so what is open flow open flows

193
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,860
exactly an abstraction of this so in

194
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,260
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of open flow open flow is an</font>

195
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,370
abstraction and an API and so the

196
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,650
abstraction is we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

197
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever we call the routing engine the</font>

198
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,039
the supervisor module would have you and

199
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,619
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open flow</font>

200
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,880
controller and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

201
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,670
set of line cards and we're going to

202
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,080
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> those the open flow data path and</font>

203
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,670
the the data path is going to have

204
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,710
inside it we're going to call a

205
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,760
forwarding table and I'll get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

206
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,789
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the details of what these things mean</font>

207
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,630
in a second but critically what we're

208
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,100
going to do is we're actually going

209
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:22,270
standardize the communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> path</font>

210
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,440
between these two things so and we're

211
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,240
also going to put it over the network

212
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,590
and i'll come back and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

213
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cause all sorts of concern for people</font>

214
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,469
so just hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to it for a second you</font>

215
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">know drink your coffee or bite your</font>

216
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:35,800
tongue or what you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will explain</font>

217
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:38,669
this to in a second but so these are

218
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,670
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> my older slides</font>

219
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,030
is it possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a new file that one</font>

220
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,030
yeah

221
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,039
to that sorry for the interruption

222
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,840
these are still my older slides

223
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:15,760
Oh Mac is hard and I see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

224
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:23,670
yeah I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go up here desk I what</font>

225
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:23,670
that up there you go all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right aha</font>

226
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,689
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the picture we had and this</font>

227
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,919
is the picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you so</font>

228
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:34,529
what this means in practice is we're

229
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,718
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the boxes that you have</font>

230
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,429
now and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a new set of</font>

231
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,169
firmware from your router<font color="#CCCCCC"> your writing</font>

232
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,390
that vendor and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put on</font>

233
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,620
that firmware an extra agent that runs

234
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:48,000
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an open</font>

235
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,130
flow agent and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font>

236
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,620
server somewhere in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and you</font>

237
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,980
can run a process on it there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

238
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,420
be the open flow controller and then

239
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,730
you're going to enact these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

240
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">know through a management</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font>

241
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,310
that protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're going to</font>

242
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:07,470
speak is open flow and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

243
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,399
over SSL and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that there's a whole</font>

244
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're thinking</font>

245
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">what vendor is going to support this you</font>

246
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,660
know do I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run linux on a</font>

247
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,140
server do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to develop this</font>

248
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,390
controller myself all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

249
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,680
being worked out so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are vendors</font>

250
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,449
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to supply open flow</font>

251
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,160
controllers for you and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of cases</font>

252
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,829
the the same people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are producing</font>

253
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,350
your routers are going into developing

254
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:29,670
open flow controllers and if you're

255
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,230
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about running things over your</font>

256
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,939
network this is effectively what happens

257
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside your box anyway so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can manage</font>

258
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,300
this connection just like you can manage

259
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:40,529
any other connection in your network but

260
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,180
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me get back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that so as I said you</font>

261
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:44,579
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the controller is is</font>

262
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,019
independent from this data path you know

263
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:47,550
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can run on an external server it can</font>

264
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,550
run physically connected to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same box</font>

265
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,319
can run on a blade in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same box that</font>

266
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data path is your existing hardware</font>

267
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,100
plus new firmware and that firmware does

268
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,069
come from your existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> router router</font>

269
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,380
manufacturer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the communication path</font>

270
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,000
over the network we use TLS SSL is

271
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,199
something to do mutual authentication to

272
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,620
make sure that we're actually talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

273
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:09,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right boxes you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually run</font>

274
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,480
these this control<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network totally out</font>

275
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,850
of band in a physically dedicated

276
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,959
management network or if that's not

277
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">available to you they're actually</font>

278
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,310
scamp's to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in band inside your</font>

279
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,630
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your actually control plane but the</font>

280
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,279
critical thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to take from</font>

281
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,170
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this communication path between</font>

standard that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what open flow is and</font>

284
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,290
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to and you were so</font>

285
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,550
inclined<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you happen to have an army</font>

of programmers which actually some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could write your own</font>

288
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,800
controller in fact there's even a

289
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:39,269
growing open source community for

290
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,709
controller writers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you could</font>

write<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own routing algorithms you</font>

292
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:43,939
could reimplement the existing routing

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,990
algorithms you could do what you wanted

294
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,800
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the crux of</font>

295
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:52,350
what open flow is or if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">an army of programmers there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

298
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,979
open flow controllers if this solves

299
00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:01,170
problems that you have so in terms of

300
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,700
what the API actually does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maps</font>

301
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,529
almost exactly to the diagram I showed

<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to modify things that are in the</font>

flow counters so if you wanted to do for

316

example dynamically rear out your

317

319
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,110
from an operator's perspective this all

320
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">seems very low level and probably crazy</font>

321
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,200
you probably never want to actually

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,180
programming I know flow controller

323
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,190
yourself I mean depends who you are but

324
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,569
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were a programmer this is</font>

325
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,060
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> like giving the keys to the</font>

326
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,950
castle if you some of you were here

327
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,930
caught the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook lightning talk</font>

328
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,970
when they were saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they</font>

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">want people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to open up the box you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

330

these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually everything</font>

331
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,439
you would need out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box to some</font>

332
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:11,940
approximation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what do</font>

333
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,230
you do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so for some of you</font>

334
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:18,089
the answer might just be you<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy an open</font>

335
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,770
flow controller and it solves problems

336
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:22,020
for you and this level of<font color="#CCCCCC"> details</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

337
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,970
exposed to you but for others<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

338
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you were open source inclined or if</font>

339
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,320
you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had to happen to have</font>

340
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,790
an army of programmers this is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

341
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,649
now actually have control of exactly

342
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:38,069
what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boxes so I</font>

343
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:39,670
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this glow table what</font>

344
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:43,600
does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually mean</font>

345
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:46,329
and so the flow table on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inside it</font>

346
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,280
is really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core of deciding how</font>

347
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:52,060
the packet processing works so a flow

348
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,980
table has three elements so a flow table

349
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,609
entry has three elements so it has a

350
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,490
priority level a<font color="#CCCCCC"> match</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set of match</font>

351
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,560
fields and a action list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's</font>

352
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,410
saying you know if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a packet that</font>

353
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,810
matches the following match forms then

354
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,530
apply this list of actions to it and so

355
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,229
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

356
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,290
generalization of all switching and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

357
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:16,450
routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> altogether so matches</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are across</font>

358
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,209
any set of packet header fields so you

359
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,820
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> say if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP if the packet is</font>

360
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,230
TCP and the destination is 22 they don't

361
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:27,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">want you to decrement the TTL and push</font>

362
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,410
it out a certain port and fact packets

363
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,730
are matched in terms of the priority so

364
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,130
you can say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it didn't match that</font>

365
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,740
then check if the the IP destination is

366
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,970
to a certain prefix and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> true</font>

367
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,180
then push<font color="#CCCCCC"> it onto a certain quality</font>

368
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,560
service class<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and you know if it</font>

369
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,099
didn't match any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those lower priority</font>

370
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,530
than drop it and so you can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

371
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,020
you know with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to program</font>

372
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,250
things at this level and this if you're

373
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,170
familiar with how the hardware works is

374
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,270
actually very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much modeled after how t</font>

375
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,459
camps work or other types of cams and

376
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,960
all forwarding technology can I

377
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,030
shouldn't say all but you know all

378
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,440
reporting technology I'm aware of can be

379
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,030
mapped onto something that looks like

380
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,700
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really an abstraction of</font>

381
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,530
what is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the deep underlying of</font>

382
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,800
the hardware this is deep into the fit

383
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:17,770
and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost think of open flow</font>

384
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:20,170
as a fib programming API but so once you

385
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,520
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this then you get back to this</font>

386
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,229
point of abstraction so what can I do

387
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,480
with this and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is everything</font>

388
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,060
you can do now you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do using</font>

389
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,370
this these primitives and just express

390
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,170
them in simpler ways so what'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

391
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,970
of switching today is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

392
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,400
matching on the layer to destination and

393
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,630
forwarding out afford what you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

394
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,220
as routing is matching on the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

395
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,110
destination decrementing a TTL<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

396
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,390
forwarding out of port never access

397
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,710
control becomes simply match the the

398
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,699
mask pattern that you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

399
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:50,650
ACL and drop the packet and then these

400
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">are just the simple things now that the</font>

401
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,590
things that you can actually do lots of

402
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,630
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with this as well</font>

403
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,280
so you imagined once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a notion</font>

404
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,350
of multiple tables which does exist an

405
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:04,150
open flow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can even do more complex</font>

406
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:07,150
things for example vrf so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll match on</font>

407
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:09,010
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> MPLS tag in a first table and based</font>

408
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:14,550
on that I'll go to a second table for a

409
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:17,740
customer specific forwarding prefix and

410
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,630
so in terms of Oklahoma to its

411
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,980
standardization<font color="#E5E5E5"> there people are</font>

412
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,720
constantly adding more fields to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

413
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,090
matched on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more at more actions to</font>

414
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,550
be applied and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the crux</font>

415
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:30,250
of what open flow is so currently you

416
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,260
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> match on layer 1 fields now what</font>

417
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,540
port<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet come in on layer 2</font>

even a source VLAN VLAN<font color="#CCCCCC"> class a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

420
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,320
like the PCB bits layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 you know</font>

421
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,870

<font color="#CCCCCC">things are abstractions of what the</font>

430
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,870

<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is we now have a mostly generic</font>

convergence in terms of what the asics

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,890
are capable of that it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly</font>

440
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,650
easy to map most of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto</font>

441
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:35,199
most of the hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in fact in a</font>

442
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,270
lot of cases what's exposed to you as an

443
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,880
operator is typically a subset of what

444
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,829
the hardware is capable of and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

445
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a very interesting aside about</font>

446
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,940
about open flow is that quite often you

447
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,579
the thing that you want to do the

448
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,110
underlying hardware is capable of it's

449
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,490
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of that the network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> option</font>

451
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:58,330
exposed that and so I mentioned there

452
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">were two things that open flow was</font>

453
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,150
trying to do one was to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

454
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,920
abstraction which I think I've covered a

455
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,869
bit and the others to reduce the number

456
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,389
of management touch points and so we can

457
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:09,040
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because if you remember the pic</font>

458
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,780
that I drew there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing that stops</font>

459
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,810
the open flow controller from managing

460
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,190
multiple data paths at the same time so

461
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,349
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually point multiple data</font>

462
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:20,760
paths at the same controller reducing a

463
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,990
number of management touch points so the

464
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">question that it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably in all of</font>

your minds<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now is you how many do</font>

00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> controllers do I have you</font>

467
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,970
what happens what if one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them dies</font>

468
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:35,560
and I'll ask you not to panic so there's

469
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,080
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about open flow that implies</font>

470
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,669
centralized control you don't point all

471
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,000
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your switches and routers that a</font>

472
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:45,010
single controller the choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> is up to</font>

473
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,780
you for what what the relationship is

474
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,120
between controllers and did in data

475
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,129
paths so if you are happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with how your</font>

476
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,350
networks work right now you can actually

477
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:59,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">get all of open flow with one controller</font>

478
00:17:53,350 --> 00:18:01,689
for each data path or maybe more likely

479
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,429
it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually to depart it up</font>

480
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,350
your networking in some way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

481
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,880
some way ends up being a very you know

482
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,360
deep network<font color="#E5E5E5"> design question as a</font>

483
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,810
function of your requirements but open

484
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,080
flow it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally orthogonal to how</font>

485
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:19,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">many controllers two switches you have</font>

486
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,490
two data paths and so you can imagine

487
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,870
there's now a communication protocol

488
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,280
between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> controller's you know maybe</font>

489
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,449
something that looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP maybe</font>

490
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,480
that's something it's a hybrid of

491
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,250
existing protocols something that says I

492
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,820
know how to get to these boxes oh you

493
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,050
know how to get to those boxes and the

494
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,649
other critical thing that the protocol

495
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:40,330
has is a notion of failover so when the

496
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,440
controller a dies you know these boxes

497
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:45,939
can fail over the controller be and so

498
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,870
these all might seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like fairly scary</font>

499
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,700
concepts but they're all they'll have

500
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:56,050
direct analogies into the boxes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

501
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:58,780
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> today if you have a multi routing</font>

502
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:00,820
engine multi chassis car box in your

503
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,320
network they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are doing these</font>

504
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,810
things internal to the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

505
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,700
typically there's an out-of-band usually

506
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,440
speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet channel that connects</font>

507
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,960
your line cards up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these route</font>

508
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,340
engines and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a fail of</font>

509
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,900
failure failover protocol that looks

510
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,419
almost exactly like what's running here

511
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,490
so while this might sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy and</font>

512
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,900
concept I claim this is actually very

513
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,960
close to what you're already doing right

514
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,780
now

515
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,370
and so this opens up lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of very</font>

516
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,990
interesting network design questions so

517
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,750
as I said you know traditional networks

518
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:35,050
run almost this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-to-one forwarding to</font>

519
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,490
control ratio of protocols and so the

520
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,970
big question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yo is this the right</font>

521
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,770
thing for everyone and you know if the

522
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,950
answer is no and I claim it's not

523
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:47,580
because if you look at things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like bgp</font>

524
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:50,170
so bgp is a one-size-fits-all protocol

525
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,730
until the size doesn't fit you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

526
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,700
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> start using things like route</font>

527
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,830
reflectors and route aggregators trying

528
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:01,000
to make bgp fit better and this is

529
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:02,050
almost a<font color="#E5E5E5"> generalization of that idea so</font>

530
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,430
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to these very interesting</font>

531
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,260
network design questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> do how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

532
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,870
controllers<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I actually need and it</font>

533
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,760
ends up<font color="#E5E5E5"> being this a balance between how</font>

534
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,800
many management touch points and I

535
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,270
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with versus what is the</font>

536
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,460
control traffic load that I have to

537
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:18,760
manage what is the failover rate that I

538
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,140
want to recover from so how many backup

539
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,290
controllers do I need doing what a

540
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,820
hierarchy of controllers even and where

541
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,590
do I put these controllers do I put a

542
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,330
couple controllers / pop do I put them

543
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,480
for geographic region do I put them /

544
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,710
continent and you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of</font>

545
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,120
alluded to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are very</font>

546
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar questions that you would ask you</font>

547
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,810
know when deploying route reflectors or

548
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,430
something similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

549
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,850
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> network design you know very</font>

550
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,350
specific to your network and my claim is

551
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,240
you can actually implement what exists

552
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">today and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably the right</font>

553
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,410
thing for some of you but it's probably

554
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,180
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right thing for all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and</font>

555
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,100
one of the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of benefits of open flow</font>

556
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,350
is that lets you decide this ratio of

557
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:01,810
forwarding paths to control paths as it

558
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:03,550
fits for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network I kind of flip</font>

559
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,909
Utley said there's a protocol between

560
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:10,120
controllers and that's a big assertion

561
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know by design this is actually</font>

562
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">not part of open flow the idea is that</font>

563
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,420
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> does protocol between</font>

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,470
pulled off the part that you need to

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,690
standardize the controller itself is

569
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,790
just software I mean you can update that

570
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,599
as fast as people update api's to

571
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,918
website to web search engines

572
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:38,849
if this is totally internal to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

573
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,440
network it doesn't need to be

574
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:43,649
standardized it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably help you in</font>

575
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,700
terms of the economics but the idea is

576
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:50,339
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decouple the intra control plane</font>

577
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,649
management from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> openflow standard</font>

578
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:55,289
which is control plane to data plane and

579
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:56,908
so the the benefit of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it allows</font>

580
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:59,399
these things to evolve independently you

581
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:03,749
don't have to buy everything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one big</font>

582
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:11,039
silo and you can critically we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

583
00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:12,899
have to get anyways it critically one

584
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,969
size does not fit all and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solution</font>

585
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:16,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to help you know another</font>

586
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:18,450
vendors maybe not the right thing for

587
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,940
you another provider is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

588
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,049
thing for you and so what I want you to

589
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">take from those pictures that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font>

entire network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> using open flow you</font>

594
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:33,359
need more on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the claim is</font>

595
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:35,399
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a critical building block</font>

00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,218
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would use to build up a larger more</font>

complete solution in the form of that

598
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:42,659
solution will depend very much on your

599
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:45,059
particular needs that is you what are

600
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:46,289
your failure requirements what is the

00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,418
the site do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an external</font>

605
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:58,079
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions that this is the</font>

606
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:59,009
essence of what network design is and

607
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,809
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the things that you really</font>

608
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:08,549
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want in a prepackaged one size</font>

609
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:09,928
fits all type format so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a there</font>

610
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:12,418
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people working on kind of</font>

611
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:14,039
this bigger picture solution and people

612
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,739
are trying to define this as

613
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,359
software-defined networking so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I</font>

614
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:19,739
look at software-defined networking is

615
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:22,289
if you start with something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font>

616
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:24,209
like open flow on the bottom there's

617
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:26,009
kind of a layer and then you would build

618
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:28,829
on top of that on top of some sort of

619
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:31,259
API and that because there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

620
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:34,009
layer you can actually d couple how<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

621
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:36,029
implemented from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want and so</font>

622
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:38,669
imagine you on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of this layer you</font>

623
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:40,739
could build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a load balancer maybe you</font>

624
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">know traffic engineering policy you know</font>

625
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:44,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">delay esta murder and you know some sort</font>

626
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of costume are facing API if you want it</font>

627
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:48,540
to follow

628
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,250
Dave Ward's example from yesterday but

629
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,470
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to take from</font>

630
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,350
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is all independent from</font>

631
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">open flow by design you know what you do</font>

632
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,300
with open flow is totally different from

633
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,590
how it works and why you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want it</font>

634
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,790
and so you know just to put things in

635
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,260
perspective you know what's under this

636
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:08,190
line is what I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in this</font>

637
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:10,320
talk and you for example and he's not

638
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only one above this line is what</font>

639
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dave was talking about yesterday and so</font>

640
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical difference here is what's</font>

641
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,320
above the line in my mind is too early

642
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,780
to standardize if at all I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

643
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,129
really your your customer this is your

644
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:28,649
business logic<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is your what you</font>

645
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:31,290
want to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network and this is</font>

646
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:34,380
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should be highly</font>

647
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,700
highly prized by your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and maybe</font>

648
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:42,060
not you know standardized and push

649
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:43,530
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a larger audience there are a</font>

650
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,540
lot of very smart people in this room

651
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:48,120
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had heard of all sorts of protocols</font>

652
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,100
that you have come and gone in my time

653
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,719
and you know the I'm sure they're a

654
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,219
large fraction of you say sitting there

655
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking you open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flow is just the same</font>

656
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,480
as global ball and I can't actually sit

657
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,030
here and go through all possible

658
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,940
instances of blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see that</font>

659
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,590
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually different popular things</font>

660
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,360
that I've heard re-open flows the same

661
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:11,189
as list open flows to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> and his ankle</font>

662
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:13,800
ste as policy based routing I heard soft

663
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,900
circuits yesterday the kind of broad

664
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,590
answer since I don't really have I mean

665
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,850
a the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is different by protocol by</font>

666
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,449
protocol but the broad<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is that</font>

667
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:26,010
you know open<font color="#CCCCCC"> closes very low-level API</font>

668
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,720
it's almost a thin wrapper around what

669
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,840
the the asics are actually capable of

670
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,420
and so yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you probably could implement</font>

671
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,149
blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah with open flow but</font>

672
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,290
conversely<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably couldn't</font>

673
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:39,300
implement open flow with blah blah blah

674
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you open flows in that way almost a</font>

675
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,250
superset of these protocols and you know

676
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,840
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is do if I already</font>

677
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,280
have blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> why would I need</font>

678
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,780
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow I mean the obvious answer is</font>

679
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,800
if you're happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your networks as</font>

680
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,190
they exist today this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

681
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,690
technology for you but my guess is that

682
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,180
most of you could deal with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks</font>

683
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,320
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit less complex it might</font>

684
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,660
make your lives a little easier and you

685
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">might sleep a little better</font>

686
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,290
and the claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you know if you</font>

687
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,420
were using open flow and this is

688
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,730
obviously a grandiose plan with a bit of

689
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:11,220
hand waving and maybe there's some

690
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:13,170
kool-aid splash on the side but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

691
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,460
claim is that you're using open flow can

692
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,990
give you a more holistic view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

693
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,250
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can reduce the</font>

694
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:20,220
complexity from the feature in the layer

695
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:22,200
interaction and so for any specific

696
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,600
instance of blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah there's</font>

697
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably not a win and if you only run</font>

698
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,899
this one protocol on your network maybe

699
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,970
open flow is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right thing for you</font>

700
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,560
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're running lots and lots of</font>

701
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,000
protocols that lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> layers across</font>

702
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:39,629
your network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something to</font>

703
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:41,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider this is actually you I said a</font>

704
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,870
strong technical foundation and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they I met at least some of that but</font>

706
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,530
there's obviously a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open</font>

707
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,900
flow so some pointers you know there's

own site with lots of open source things

712
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,370
there's a open flow based hypervisor

713
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,930
which I wrote a bunch of open flow

714
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,080
controllers that are free for you to

715
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:09,300
download and build<font color="#E5E5E5"> on if you aren't</font>

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in you know applying OpenFlow</font>

717
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,270
firmware to things that in your network

718
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,939
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a open flow</font>

719
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">network emulator that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use just</font>

720

<font color="#CCCCCC">to try out and play around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with called</font>

721
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,419
mini net and that there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

722
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:24,060
pretty large growing base of people and

723
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,890
tools being developed in this space and

724
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:33,200
these URLs or at least the places to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

725
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:33,200
started so that's what open flow is

726
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,980
let me see if I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover some use cases</font>

727
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,830
to convince you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

728
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your particular networks</font>

729
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:49,040
so at a high level new Oakland flows an

730
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,340
API that enables lots and lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

731
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,540
different use cases and you that in my

732
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind the sky's the limit for what you</font>

733
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,659
could actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but you know</font>

734
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,910
really to spark your imagination for

735
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,170
this talk I cherry picked a couple set

736
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,780
of use cases I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think every bit</font>

737
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:05,980
interested to this group and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I picked</font>

738
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:08,180
them kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a service provider emphasis</font>

739
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,040
all the use cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to cover</font>

740
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,460
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> demonstrated at Stanford in</font>

741
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:16,850
wide area networks so we know they work

742
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:19,610
at some level and it's worth mentioning

743
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:21,110
that I think almost every point while

744
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,990
the demonstrations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm showing are you</font>

745
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:26,209
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very ill a slapdash proof of</font>

746
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,400
concepts run by grad students my claim

747
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them have</font>

748
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,240
commercial companies they're working on

749
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,490
you production grade solutions for you

750
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,720
if you're interested and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't</font>

751
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,370
see the use case that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like here</font>

752
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,010
there's actually a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more complete</font>

753
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:44,689
with videos online at the link here off

754
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:46,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenFlow website but so one of the</font>

755
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,800
biggest interesting use cases with open

756
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,330
flow is actually virtualization so

757
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,190
there's two cases where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

758
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,810
virtualization is really of interest and

759
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,100
service providers one is if you're

760
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:58,040
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like a virtual tenant</font>

761
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,780
network and your clients your tenants

762
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,730
actually want more direct control over

763
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,530
their network so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to</font>

764
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,790
create a VLAN within their virtual

765
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,110
tenant network or maybe they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

766
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,360
access control lists within their

767
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,620
virtual tenant network and so my

768
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,209
understanding and practice today what

769
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,370
that turns out to be is they call you

770
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,260
and then you open<font color="#CCCCCC"> the config file you</font>

771
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:17,000
think a little bit you said well I guess

772
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,260
this won't break everything and then you

773
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,690
edit the config file and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply this</font>

774
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:24,379
and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not terribly</font>

775
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:25,610
scalable and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

776
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually the tool that I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> developed</font>

777
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:30,379
you could actually as the operator of

778
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,649
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network run an open flow controller</font>

779
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,540
which is effectively a hypervisor

780
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:38,030
something that says I'm going to give

781
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,040
Alice customer Alice control of any

782
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:42,590
traffic that happens to match her mpls

783
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,659
tag or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that matches her IP</font>

784
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,520
prefix and she can do anything she wants

785
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">with traffic that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matches this list of</font>

786
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,560
rules and then I'm also going to ensure

787
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that she can't she can't affect any</font>

788
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:57,590
traffic that doesn't match this list of

789
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:59,810
rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you can now let Alice you</font>

790
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,389
know create a CLS she can create mpls

791
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:03,770
tags or do what she wants as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it</font>

792
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,910
matches the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you set aside for</font>

793
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,250
her and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can set aside different</font>

794
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:08,720
rules for different customers and

795
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,430
there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> logic to make sure that</font>

796
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,040
the the rules are overlapping and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sane</font>

797
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,290
in some way and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

798
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you had a customer interested in open</font>

799
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,780
flow itself you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that this is</font>

800
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">another thing you would actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

801
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,960
exposed open flow directly to them with

802
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,240
the understanding that they can only

803
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,000
impact the the traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've given</font>

804
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,770
them access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and so maybe you're not a</font>

805
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,490
virtual tenant<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network maybe you're a</font>

806
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:33,200
large over the top provider but you

807
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,340
happen to run a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of services maybe</font>

808
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,370
you have a mail service maybe you have

809
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">video streaming service this ends up</font>

810
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">being interesting to you as well because</font>

811
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,830
you could think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these different</font>

812
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">groups as different customers and maybe</font>

813
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,159
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can give the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video streaming</font>

814
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,990
people the ability to load balance there

815
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,270
traffic in a way that they want without

816
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,650
impacting how it without<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to make</font>

817
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:59,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the mail folks go through the same</font>

818
00:30:51,650 --> 00:31:03,140
load dancer something else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

819
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:04,520
interesting to people is is a Dave Ward

820
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,220
called it cloud bursting this is a

821
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,620
subset of this I I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was just as</font>

822
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,740
you wide area when migration so the idea

823
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:15,590
is you've got a wide area vm migrations

824
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,240
the idea is you have a BM it has active

825
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,949
connections to it you want to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

826
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,050
from one data center to another while

827
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,160
keeping the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same IP without having to</font>

828
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,919
alert the clients or change the

829
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,990
protocols or anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

830
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is with open flow what this looks</font>

831
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,960
like is you talk to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Olfa flow</font>

832
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,750
controller say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm moving the the vm</font>

833
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,510
from A to B update all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font>

834
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:38,060
forwarding tables along the path and

835
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:40,220
just transparently without the the

836
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,470
source of the destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

837
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:45,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">re route</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the path and so this looks a</font>

838
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:49,520
lot like IP anycast except the control

839
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:52,100
channel is out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of band and so the demo</font>

840
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,200
that we did actually at Stanford was the

841
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:58,070
the sources here were actually clients

842
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,350
to a first-person shooter game and that

843
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,610
the server was actually a a first person

844
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,799
shooter server and

845
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:06,799
had clients playing the playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game</font>

846
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:08,929
as we migrated the vm from<font color="#CCCCCC"> california to</font>

847
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">japan while maintaining the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ip</font>

848
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:12,940
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> without interruption of service</font>

849
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:22,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm actually going to skip this in the</font>

850
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:24,500

851
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,620
actually reducing energy efficiency

energy costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and data centers so most</font>

853
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,459
data centers are built out for peak peak

854
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:33,110
usage which means you during non-peak

855
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,720
times there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> substantial fraction</font>

unused fractions of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font>

861
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:52,340
intelligently route around them and so

862
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:54,470
this very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea depending on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

your connectivity and your usage

patterns can actually save a fair bit of

865
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,309
electricity and for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you that</font>

866
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:02,990
ends up<font color="#CCCCCC"> being a fairly dominant cost for</font>

each of these by the way that if you're

876
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,270
of standardization there's this newly

877
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,669
formed opening networking foundation

878
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:28,809
it's now charged<font color="#CCCCCC"> with maintaining all of</font>

879
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:30,770
the open<font color="#CCCCCC"> flow and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its related protocols</font>

880
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:32,899
open flow originally came out of

881
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:34,940
Stanford University and there was some

882
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:37,070
initial attempts you haphazard to do

883
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:40,700
standardizations body out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Stanford</font>

884
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:42,620
and those didn't work very well the open

885
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,480
networking foundations composed of

886
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,500
promoters and adopters and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to</font>

887
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,299
what that means but critically if you're

888
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,370
a promoter or adopter you agree to

889
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:55,610
cross-license all of the IPR to all of

890
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,629
the other members royalty-free so the

891
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">question that you're all asking</font>

892
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:02,390
yourselves is why is this not in the ITF

893
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:04,640
and a you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask Dan pit the creator</font>

894
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,620
of the open networking foundation but my

895
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,950
belief is the answer is the IPR policy

896
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:12,138
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there was concern but you know</font>

897
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:13,918
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great way to kill something like open</font>

898
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,570
flow would be to you know

899
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,509
put something copyrighted into the

900
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,040
standard and then kill<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and so the</font>

901
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:26,169
notion of the open networking foundation

902
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,940
is explicit to to avoid that in terms of

903
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:30,158
its board that these are the promoters

904
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,159
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's actually a pretty</font>

905
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,750

909
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,940
terms of the adopters there's almost

every vendor that you can think of has

911

<font color="#CCCCCC">going on I'll give you guys a second</font>

915
00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:00,190
here to read this slide just to make

916
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:08,230
sure that you know either your company

917
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:10,570
is on this list or your providers are we

918
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:15,010
also ran a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> sizeable interrupt</font>

fest at interop critically you laughter

920
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,370
a fair bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> work and duct tape</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

922
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:23,080
up flow implementations from 14

00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:28,270
different vendors to interoperate under

924
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:29,920
a single controller so on the right we

925
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,810
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of all the vendors who have</font>

926
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,190
participated this does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not mean that</font>

927
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">knew these vendors have commercial</font>

deciding you what to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with open flow</font>

933

at this point so your input is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:45,069
planned to go up to 34 pops of open flow

spread across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're</font>

the affiliate project in Europe spread

959
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,390
across five countries there and so these

960
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:59,549
are all open flow base you know up

961
00:36:54,390 --> 00:37:01,450
networks available for people to use so

962
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,430
kind of jump through the last bit

963
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly running a little</font>

964
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,730
out of time but I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow some</font>

965
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:09,069
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for questions but the the</font>

966
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,990
high-level point is my claim is that

967
00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:14,170
networking needs better abstractions in

968
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:17,109
order to reduce complexity open flow is

969
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:19,450
an abstraction and an API and time will

970
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:21,279
tell if it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right abstraction but</font>

971
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:24,310
my claim is that it's at least asking

972
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,980
the right questions and we'll see what

973
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,299
the results are there are lots of use

974
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,970
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be of interest to you</font>

975
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,619
I've only hit on a couple of them here

976
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,959
and open flow is on its way towards

977
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:37,800
widespread adoption in terms of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

978
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,609
onf and the number of deployments so

979
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,630
thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for your time and</font>

980
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:42,630
I'll take<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

981
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,260
so we have just a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes for</font>

982
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:55,420
questions we'll start on the left good

morning Jeff Sachs from Blue Ridge

984
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,040
internet works um so you said a couple

00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:03,450
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times in the middle of the talk that</font>

986
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:06,130
what you were showing was perhaps scary

987
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,270
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't scared by most of it</font>

988
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,830
because I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that's about</font>

thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me is what happens when packets</font>

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,660
that an art packet has to be

996
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,080
encapsulated in SSL and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

997
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,670
continent so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that it works in</font>

998
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,460
practice is that the controller decides

999
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:36,820
what gets punted to the controller so

1000
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:39,220
the rule is anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does not match</font>

1001
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:42,070
in the forwarding table gets punted up

1002
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:44,890
and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arp to get and</font>

1003
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,330
punch it up to the controller you can

1004
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,910
insert a forwarding rule that matches

1005
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,840
our that says here is the places<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

1006
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,160
you to send it so you can imagine

1007
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,290
putting together something that looks

1008
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:57,730
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SCP tree or something like that</font>

1009
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,990
to manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time</font>

1010
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,240
there are applications where you might

1011
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,680
want to our pup to the controller you

1012
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,600
know for example if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

1013
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">do managed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ARP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe you'd</font>

1014
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,910
provisioned your controllers so that

1015
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,650
they weren't on the other side of the

1016
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,839
country there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one per pop or</font>

1017
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,160
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that I mean so the the</font>

1018
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,560
critical thing to take away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this is</font>

that opal lets you pick either of those

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,460
two solutions and either those two

1021
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:23,230
solutions will be right for some people

1022
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:24,880
and wrong for the others<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

1023
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll close the mics here those people</font>

1024
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,420

we'll move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center microphone I have</font>

1034
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:52,450
like the route engine but it's

1035
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:54,160
externalized well not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1036
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,540
can't get rid of the are out engine so

1037
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,009
there's some things that have to

1038
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,570
stay there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to decide which</font>

is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay there and which is</font>

1040
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:03,070
going to be put remotely so that's kind

1041
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,560
of a design decision that's going to be

1042
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">critical to be made with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> respect to</font>

punting packets today router vendors

1044
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,490
struggled quite a bit with the

1045
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">round-trip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time between punting a packet</font>

1046
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,339
to the routing engine and I'm

1047
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">programming all the line cards and</font>

1048
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,740
keeping the FIB synchronized we always

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to optimize that so the non</font>

1050
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:25,479
synchronization time is kept to less

1051
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,730
than milliseconds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really a big</font>

1052
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,930
challenge so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtt time now when you</font>

1053
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,370
have to punt all the way to a network

1054
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,200
controller and back are going to be

1055
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,940
orders of magnitude so you have to

1056
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,490
decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you punt you have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1057
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,200
judicious and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what good with red lines</font>

1058
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:40,089
and comments or questions because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your comments oh you want to respond</font>

1060

please<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead so I mean you know</font>

1061
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,350
exactly as I was saying I mean you know

1062
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,060
if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know inside a</font>

1063
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,960
multi router chassis off a line card

1064
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,340
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that looks like a</font>

1065
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,310
host<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually will do are up to</font>

1066
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,410
figure out where the route engine is and

1067
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,970
you know that there's effectively a

1068
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,089
different management control network

1069
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:04,060
that manages those connections right and

1070
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:05,770
very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with open flow from the</font>

1071
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,350
route engine but you're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna need</font>

1072
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,750
are right you still<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk but the idea is</font>

1073
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:12,400
it's a different network you can almost

1074
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,320
think of these things as internally as

1075
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,670
routers doesn't matter because the ARP

1076
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the network controller will add no</font>

1077
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,510
value if they have to keep it locally I

1078
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,760
mean most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of items you make this is</font>

1079
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,290
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> arps so if I'm arcing across</font>

1080
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,050
my data plan it's very different from

1081
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:28,779
across my<font color="#E5E5E5"> control plane you are for both</font>

1082
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:31,030
reasons it's true<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a gale if</font>

1083
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,220
alice is trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to Bob that's</font>

1084
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">vivid that generates an art message</font>

1085
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,680
which is very different for the art

1086
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,570
messages generated from the controller

1087
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,100
if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this over white</font>

1088
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,750
border might be easier if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you program</font>

1089
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FIB from the network controller and</font>

1090
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,900
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the next hop mac address</font>

1091
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,160
you got to get it so is the network

1092
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,690
control are going to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

1093
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,399
information or do you split the

00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,260
functionality if you're doing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font>

1095
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,850
controller data you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean this is</font>

1096
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,930
the earlier question that there are

1097
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:57,180
right answers and any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

1098
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:59,640
depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and sir</font>

1099
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:02,700
others<font color="#CCCCCC"> were more we have other people in</font>

1100
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,109
line I'm sorry feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grab me</font>

1101
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,359
offline and we can we can continue

1102
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:09,049
discuss this hi Patrick and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1103
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:12,450
Akamai Technologies you mentioned that

1104
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:15,390
first is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardware sports many more</font>

1105
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:16,680
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are exposed in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the UI the</font>

1106
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:19,078
router vendors for good or for bad

1107
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,000
actually frequently hide things because

1108
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,059
it causes performance problems for

1109
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,520
instance on this what is there or you

1110
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:28,380
have some way to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure the open flow</font>

1111
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,869
controller is not asking the hardware to

1112
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,869
do something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know decimate</font>

1113
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:36,240
whatever else is going on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box two</font>

1114
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:38,339
quick answers that there are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1115
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,078
some level capability negotiations in

1116
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:43,558
the open protocol so the controller can

1117
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,440
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware can you do this the other</font>

1118
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,790
answer to that is much like on the

1119
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,710
routing engine you know the overflow

1120
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:51,900
controller assumes some level of

1121
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:54,990
competence in the programmer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> L is a</font>

1122
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,700
mistake well yes and no I mean it's the

1123
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:59,339
competence you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that assumption or</font>

1124
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,230
you cost and performance and so in some

1125
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:04,410
ways the open flow is a loaded<font color="#CCCCCC"> gun</font>

1126
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:06,450
pointed at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your foot it's up to you to</font>

1127
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:07,319
decide how to use it fair point thank

1128
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,930
you very much very good presentation

the case yet to this community of<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

1135
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:25,530
operators you know should<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font>

1136
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,960
themselves into programmers I think I

1137
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:30,390
think there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a subset of</font>

1138
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,210
corner cases where people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

1139
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,650
seriously into DIY you know like the

1140
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,420
facebooks or whatever who basically

1141
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:38,430
wanted you know strip the intelligence

1142
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,200
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10,000 switches you know</font>

1143
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,879
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> write their own protocols and</font>

1144
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,558
slam stuff into that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's</font>

1145
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,349
clearly the case you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could see</font>

1146
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:48,690
those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases but you know the</font>

1147
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:50,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea it when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make the complexity</font>

1148
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,410
argument and you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there</font>

1149
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,000
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these different matrices of</font>

1150
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,890
protocols that's because a lot of people

1151
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,190
do things in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1152
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,839
one size fits all right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

1153
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:03,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know it's as soon as you start</font>

1154
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:05,759
saying OK in DIY you can simplify

1155
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,259
everything yourself you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

1156
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,030
it all your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> way but I think the idea</font>

1157
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,570
that somehow people are going to

1158
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,930
reinvent bgp on their own

1159
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:15,820
is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know absurd really but the you</font>

1160
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:17,169
know but if you want to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

1161
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,850
and everybody does it all in different

1162
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,920
ways you're going to just reinvent all

1163
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:23,140
that kind of matrix of complexity right

1164
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,760
so you know you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> always go back to</font>

1165
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,200
first principles and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do</font>

1166
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,820
everything yourself by getting down to

1167
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,279
basics kind of like programming in

1168
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,650
machine language right but most of the

1169
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,540
time you know what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want is they</font>

1170
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:36,400
want to pay their vendor to implement

1171
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,890
that protocol for them and that's why

1172
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">all you know you have all the costs you</font>

1173
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,450
know three quarters of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost by you</font>

1174
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:45,339
know by router vendors is in their

1175
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:47,259
software development you know which by

1176
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,090
the way software-defined networking I

1177
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,890
think it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be called DIY</font>

1178
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:54,940
software-defined networking that's part

1179
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:57,040
of the height<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so sure um so if I</font>

1180
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,450
gave too much of a dyi spin on this

1181
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,910
that's my own personal bias and I

1182
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:03,270
apologize for that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tried to throw in</font>

1183
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:05,410
there as<font color="#E5E5E5"> much as possible but you know</font>

1184
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,630
and i think i might even said this

1185
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:10,299
explicitly that you for a lot of you

1186
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:12,070
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> flow itself is not interesting it's</font>

1187
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> k it's the solutions that enables</font>

1188
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:16,780
there are sets of solutions that are

1189
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible only because it's simpler for</font>

1190
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,790
someone else to implement if you think

1191
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:23,740
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization example that I</font>

1192
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:26,200
gave mm-hmm you know that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1193
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,669
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for someone to implement you</font>

1194
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,109
know say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco say juniper tries to</font>

1195
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,910
implement this using existing

1196
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:32,230
configuration files you really need an

1197
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:35,529
internal restructuring for that to

1198
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:37,600
happen and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe use open flow</font>

1199
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:39,130
maybe you don't and from an operator

1200
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,660
perspective this is irrelevant these are

1201
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:43,600
implementation details and I certainly

1202
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:47,680
you know it can see that point at the

1203
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,970
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time without a community push</font>

1204
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">towards something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this the</font>

1205
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,810
operators do not have the right

1206
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:54,580
financial incentives to do things but to

1207
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:56,500
revamp the solutions they're making lots

1208
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,120
of money these are my<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal opinions</font>

1209
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,000
I apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm offending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone here</font>

1210
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,040
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they there is not a financial</font>

1211
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,170
incentive<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them to rewrite the</font>

1212
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,430
protocols not rewrite the protocols but

1213
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,100
reimplement the protocols using

1214
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:13,899
something that's ultimately simpler and

1215
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:15,730
so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I i I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ma this might have</font>

1216
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,080
been my fault is my own personal bias<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1217
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,820
pitched this almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a programmer</font>

1218
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:21,009
standpoint that there really are

1219
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,630
benefits to be had to non program or

1220
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:25,420
operators in

1221
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:28,119
yeah well we'll see we'll see exactly

1222
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,259
thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question well thank</font>
