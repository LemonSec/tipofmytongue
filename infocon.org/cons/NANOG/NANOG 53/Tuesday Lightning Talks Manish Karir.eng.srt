56
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,720
interesting because the the distribution

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:47,299
on address allocations per country are

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,120
much more interesting basically the the

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,450
American the Aaron region is largely us

60
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,489

reminder of the three primary spam lists

we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at and we're going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at distributions across those so</font>

67
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:16,010
not a surprise big allocations to the

68

<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s. mean big allocations in in in the</font>

69
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,010
in the block lists but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is</font>

70
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,560
interesting over here is the chart at

71
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,000
the bottom which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">comparing how across different regions</font>

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,260
the different percentages you see and

74
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,859
it's very interesting that the the

75
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,899
relative occupancy of the end region IPS

76
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,120
on these different spamming lists is

77
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,950
much lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> six percent one percent one</font>

78
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,170
percent compared to ripe region for

00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,149
example which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 51% thirty percent and</font>

80
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:45,109
lactic region comes in somewhere in the

81
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,280
middle what is one interesting thing

82
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do want to look at is what</font>

83
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens when you look at relative</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it on a block list and then you see</font>

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually something interesting starting</font>

88
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:01,549
to emerge the top graph is

89
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:03,230
pure counts of different numbers of IP

90
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,090

blacklist the<font color="#CCCCCC"> barracuda list and on the</font>

92
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,570
bottom you're looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relative</font>

93
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,070
distribution that is a fraction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

total address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was allocated to a</font>

99

comparable so where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we getting at</font>

100
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,320
not all networks are created equal when

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,750
it comes to entries on asp analyst in

102
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,860
general the N region has much smaller

103
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:36,050
percentage of listings and the only

104
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,610
thing we can talk about is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the u.s. is</font>

105
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:43,250
such a large allocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it sort of</font>

106
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:45,470
blurs out anything else moving on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,240
malware and the fishing list analysis we

do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our methodology is the same just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">take the list result into my eye peas</font>

110
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:56,750
and move on and once again comparing

112
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">percentages across different regions is</font>

113
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,740
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting comparison for example</font>

114
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,510
you'll see Erin IPS over here form a

115
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,000
much larger percentage of the total

116
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,180
lists than for example say<font color="#E5E5E5"> lakna core</font>

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,010
ripe so malware and phishing lists have

118
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:18,890
a much higher occupancy of Erin region

119
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:22,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">ip's this is a distribution by country</font>

120
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:24,409
for a different list that that we

121
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,770
categorize as active malicious activity

122
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,630
once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a big contributor but if</font>

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,960
comparison where the the right region

126
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,580
Eyed Peas account for much higher

127

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,179
you're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see is get a picture</font>

130
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,620
from a global perspective of of how

different ip's in different parts of the

134
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,150
take a look deep dive a little bit more

135
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,550
would just look at address distribution

136
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,590
by asn so they're roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty one</font>

thousand hands in the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> in region they</font>

these are the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 converted to name</font>

apologize that numbers on this table are
