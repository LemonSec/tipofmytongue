00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,689
hopefully the presentation material

19
00:00:54,289 --> 00:01:01,760
that means the free pool of available

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:05,009
ipv4 address has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> fully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depleted and</font>

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,289
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously triggers the industry to</font>

move to the ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure</font>

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:17,420
however due to really

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay however the migration to ipv6 will</font>

26
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,440
not happen overnight as we all know that

observation actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's still very</font>

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,630
strong business in ipv4 just in<font color="#CCCCCC"> March of</font>

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:44,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year will notice that that</font>

33
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,830
microsoft acquired 600,000 ipv4

34
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,960
addresses from<font color="#CCCCCC"> nortel using six and a</font>

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,429
half million dollars and if you do the

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,050
math there that's actually eleven

37
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,080
dollars and twenty-five<font color="#E5E5E5"> cents per each</font>

38
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,300
ipv4 address to give you a perspective

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,520
that's even more costlier than a domain

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,450
name so we still sees very strong

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,920
business and ipv4 from that perspective

42
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:10,860
plus some customers will never wish to

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,930
retire IP before some ipv4 applications

44
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,750
or services<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are difficult to move</font>

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,480
to ipv6 may stay in happy before

46
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,360
indefinitely what does that<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean to us</font>

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,310
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will see IP v4 and v6 will</font>

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,040

such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> tunneling or milk address</font>

the presentation instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reaching to</font>

95
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,299
a conclusion is to stimulate the

96
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:39,870
effective storming brainstorming on the

97
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,070
topic because this is a rather new

98
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,840
controversial area that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

in a broadband service<font color="#CCCCCC"> provider</font>

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,930
point on the right side the traffic

123

enters the broadband co-op the service

defined as the intercept access point

<font color="#CCCCCC">right another edge device which is</font>

another intercept access point where

directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> entering firm the left to right</font>

136
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:31,870
both intercept access points are already

the original traffic identifying

00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:17,079
resolve the problems and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font>

191
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:20,079
they're quite intuitive number one when

192
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:22,930
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> say DNS changes to the original ipv4</font>

193

address by prepending some ipv6 prefix

194
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,069
then we can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that prefix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

195
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,240
restore the ipv4 address that's

196
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:33,610
intuitive number two<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

197

original v6 to be for a dress out of its

199
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,880
own address pool then let's restore it

200
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,489
by tracing back the ipv6 address from

205
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,430
when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the last problem</font>

206
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,319
statement when we say reporting both IP

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,630
versions are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not allowed by the standard</font>

208
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,020
then what we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

209
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,730
represent one IP version in another

210
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,540
address format in this case what we can

211
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,600
do is we

212
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,360
represent ipv4 address in the ipv6

213
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:24,730
address format so both IP address

214
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:26,860
remains in same IP via IP version option

215
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:30,040
two is we can push the responsibility

216
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,630
off to law enforcement agencies they

217
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,910
will do a similar job the only

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference is that responsibilities</font>

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,800
perform the battle is now the service

220
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,870

221
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">is ideal situation from the service</font>

222
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,640

223
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,460
can do is it can do the exactly same job

224
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,680
restoring the original ipv4 address by

225

227
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,600
listing here is we can propose the

228
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,750
standard revision to the standard a

229
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,330
bodies to handle such interworking

230

scenario just to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message to</font>

carry IP headers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of both versions so in</font>

232
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,580
that case it requires the service

233
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,980
provider community to be the ultimate

234
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:26,920

revisions while the proposed solutions

seemed a very interpret intuitive there

237
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,650
were open questions that may be worth

238
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,380

solutions to resolve the problem number

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,780
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> question that were faced with is the</font>

ipv4 mapped ipv6 address under suitable

243
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:53,110
yes remember we're using this ipv6

244
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,079

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:13,210
address type has its own protocol use if

251
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:17,110
you refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to IETF RFC it is solely</font>

270
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:14,360
can see is that the lius would want the

further mediate the data as an example

274
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:26,510
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> always prefer the plain text</font>

with and this new requirement is came

278
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,569
out very recently sometime last year and

transition mechanisms of course there

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,059
were other many who are popular as well

485
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:09,110
that service providers will be trying to

486
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:11,299
achieve is to provide the lawful

that are as transition technology

489

is regardless the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transitional</font>

555
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:30,690
and I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this Clea stuff at my</font>

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,039
last job in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact I did every court order</font>

557
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,289
we did for the for four straight years

558
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:37,408
and deployed the Kali infrastructure for

559
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:40,590
the company so I a little question i'm

560
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:42,720
not exactly sure how v4 or v6 either

561
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,340
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> matters in the case of Clea</font>

562
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,859
intercept you essentially tell the edge

563
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,109
device in most employment you tell the

564
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:51,480
edge device this subscriber he needs to

565
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:53,158
go over the right you don't really

566
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,749
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all right you copy all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

567
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,710

IP address needs to go over there so

572
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:06,748
with this high p address and this ipv6

573
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:09,389

isn't smart enough to understand

anything more than a / 32 in v4 land and

582
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:28,529
you're kind of lucky if it actually

knows that right you're correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms</font>

584
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:32,879
of the mediation device should be able

that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talked about to reflect or</font>

590
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:49,230
restore the original traffic identifying

591
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:52,080
information that's the job<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is P has</font>

592
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,999
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess but the ISP is gonna say</font>

593
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,189
this customer which equals this IP

594
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:58,619
address needs to get mediated right I

595
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:00,809
think Fred breakers here somewhere and

596
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:01,980
he did a bunch of the cisco side work if

597
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:03,570
he's in the room maybe he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yap</font>

598
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,850
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mic and answer a question</font>

599
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,529
which is it understands v4 it should

600
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,539
understand v6 it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing an access</font>

601
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:13,649
list function so like is that how it

602
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:15,989
works Fred where's brick he has no power

603
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:18,018
mono standing ipv4 and ipv6 but the

604
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:20,549
problem is is that ipv4 and ipv6

605
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:22,889
captured by the mediation device<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

606
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:23,530
is the original or the real customer

607
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:25,510
identify

608
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,820
information we need to report in Academy

609
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,070
suppose it's not because it's changed by

610
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,840
the transitional mechanism for example

611
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:33,429
its<font color="#CCCCCC"> transition it's changed by the</font>

612
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,530
translator sitting in the network path

613
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:37,630
then the mediation device needs to do

614
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:41,770
extra work to restore the origin

615
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:43,330
identifying information<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it needs to</font>

616
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:45,460
strip off a header right I mean exactly

617
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly if that's the work that's a</font>

618
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,830
big long presentation to say we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

619
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">do mediation great we do that today</font>

620
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,360
already right I guess yes but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

621
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,070
new mediation requirements imposed on

622
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,229
the media device to accommodate the

623
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,610
interworking scenarios basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

624
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,100
what I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to join knows the</font>

625
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,290
Juniper<font color="#E5E5E5"> site answer what no actually but</font>

626
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone related to visit</font>

627
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,240
yeah why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't you simply take the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layer</font>

628
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,980
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a manager on from juniper networks</font>

629
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,200
while you're not taking simply all

630
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:17,920
related to data and sending this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

631
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:21,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">l EA because they're there possibly</font>

632
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,920
altered or changed by the transitional

633
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:25,419
mechanisms if we pass that data as we're

634
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,010
talking in the presentation to the

635
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,500
requesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee as it wouldn't be making</font>

636
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,330
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them well that's the problem no</font>

637
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,150
that's the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the problem</font>

638
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,240
we're trying to resolve from the service

639
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:40,600
provider perspective my question is why

640
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,900
do you do this why don't you simply tell

641
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,399
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> le8 go figure it out that we sort of</font>

642
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">a touch basting in the presentation as</font>

643
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,360
well as a general train a based on

644
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,070
observation is that the government is

645
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,719
pushing more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> the responsibly</font>

646
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">onto the service providers shoulder</font>

647
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,650
instead of doing stuff on themselves

648
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,510
they used to invest millions and

649
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,790
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars to develop</font>

650
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:02,860
decryptions of software by their own

651
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:05,830
just to decrypt the encrypted content

652
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,510
from the service provider but that's not

653
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,340
true anymore like we mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

654
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:13,240
example mentioning this presentation

655
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:16,030
last year the federal government<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

656
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,670
proposing a law they want Congress to

657
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:20,170
pass a law to impulse that decryption

658
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,240
requirement to the service provider

659
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,730
itself so they're not even doing that

660
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,680
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trend shows that they are</font>

661
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:29,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">pushing the responsibility of lawful</font>

662
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,780
intercept to the industry more and more

663
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why service provider needs to</font>

664
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:36,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">investigate the mechanisms that we need</font>

665
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,970
or new requirements we need to take care

666
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,110
of

667
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accommodate the interworking</font>

668
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:43,928
scenarios so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take two more</font>

669
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:47,230
questions Marty<font color="#E5E5E5"> one second chris</font>

670
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:50,169
donnelly<font color="#CCCCCC"> cablelabs i think part of this</font>

671
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:52,809
also depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which side of your NAT</font>

672
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:54,760
device you do your lawful intercept so

673
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:56,139
if you do it on the inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the net</font>

674
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,870
device then the headers haven't been

675
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,000
changed yet and you can report exactly

676
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:03,039
what's coming out of your edge device

677
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,140
whereas if you do it on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside then</font>

678
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,750
as you say you do have to account for

679
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> translation exactly you're correct</font>

680
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:13,090
you're correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you with regards to</font>

681
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,860
pushing more requirements on the

682
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,168
providers this is all done to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

683
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">recon a cost recovery basis isn't it if</font>

684
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:21,340
I'm correct can you confirm<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can you</font>

685
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:24,039
repeat<font color="#E5E5E5"> am sorry this is all your</font>

686
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,899
operating your your meeting these

687
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,908
requirements on a cost recovery basis

688
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,500
correct so when you talk about the

689
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:30,820
government pushing more requirements on

690
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,080
you you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that they're asking</font>

691
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,490
you for things outside the act that

692
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,559
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do more work</font>

693
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,600
correctly yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly and it's on a</font>

694
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,010
cost recovery basis correct exactly

695
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,629
that's correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

696
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,490
making I mean they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing changes</font>

697
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:45,039
to the law itself but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> missing</font>

698

<font color="#CCCCCC">thats officially become enacted as as</font>

699
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,620
amendment for example to the original

700
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:52,000
1994 Clea act but they keep proposing

701
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,969
the new requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it comes to</font>

702
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,980
oil oil intercept and they keep asking

703
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,289
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress to pass them into law</font>

704
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:04,440
that's what we observed<font color="#CCCCCC"> through all the</font>

705
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:04,440
years thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>
