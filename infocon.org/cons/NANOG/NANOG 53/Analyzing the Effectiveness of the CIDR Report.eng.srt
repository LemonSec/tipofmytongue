talking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about today is this work</font>

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did looking at the effectiveness</font>

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,779
of the cider report the email that you

many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you are familiar with it I think</font>

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,090
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people have different opinions</font>

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,590
as to whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the cider board you</font>

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,660
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ever worked and I hope to</font>

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">shed some light on this and also you</font>

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,620
know offer some suggestions about ways

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,820
in which it might be made more effective

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,538
it's something that operators to care

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,100
about so first<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be starting off with</font>

21
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,260
a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> history about the cider report</font>

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,850
for people who weren't around during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,730
class for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> classes transition then oh</font>

24
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,870
sorry sorry and then talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,038
approach that we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

26
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,010
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not the cider board actually</font>

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,809
you know was effective the results that

28
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,548
we found some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their other</font>

29
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,520
observations that we made about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

30
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,990
report that really took this you know

31
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,220
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> insights that we have about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

32
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,770
and then finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> some conclusions but</font>

33
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,979
you know with whether it worked and what

34
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,509
else we can do and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess the other</font>

35
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,100
thing to know she's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you</font>

a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these presentations and papers</font>

45
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,549
here that I note below as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">quick history on the side report from</font>

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,530
people as I said who weren't around in

49
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,740
the mid 90s or early nineties when this

50
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,840
was going on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> genesis inside report</font>

51
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,750
was the transition<font color="#CCCCCC"> from classful the</font>

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,780
classless addressing and this in turn

53
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,329
was motivated by i guess and bgp scaling

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,369
problems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also the you know the fact</font>

55
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,210
the initial allocation of between<font color="#CCCCCC"> a's</font>

56
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,740
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> b's and c's was not great and so</font>

57
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,880
there needed to be a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

58
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">instead of announcing</font>

60
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,040

classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain routing to deal</font>

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,829
with this it was built into PGP for and

63
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,380
by the you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid-1990s as far as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

64
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,760
understand it was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know vendors that</font>

65
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,350
implemented it was available<font color="#E5E5E5"> in routers</font>

66
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,790
but then the next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually</font>

67
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,650
needed to happen was behavior change in

68
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,269
the part of operators operators needed

69
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,770
to reconfigure their routers to instead

70
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">of announcing you know they're each</font>

71
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,750
block they have from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin as a class C</font>

72
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,820
or Class B they<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to announce them</font>

73
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,190
as soon as aggregate combining their

74
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,680
contiguous blocks together and so this

75
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the cider report was born</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of this</font>

76
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,540
to encourage operators to change their

77
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,760
the way that the rotors were configured

78
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,260
so the the earliest side report was in

79
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,120
the form of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a top ten list that appear</font>

80
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,760
on the ITF cider deployment lists your

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,740
least one I thought was around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 92 94 in</font>

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the is relevance to nanigen moved the</font>

83
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,060
noun on glist in September 96 and you

84
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,700
know has basically been unchanged since

85
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,140
then it was initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> launched by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tony</font>

86
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,750

in 2002 and so antidotal<font color="#CCCCCC"> II did it work</font>

89
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,630
you know way<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the day and it you</font>

90
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,560
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will talk a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more about</font>

91
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more generally but there's</font>

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,280
anecdotally it appears that here's an

93
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,890
unusual down into the right plot at the

94
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,740
routing table no this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> old the</font>

95
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,059
the numbers on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left are much smaller</font>

96
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,670
but similarly Jeff Houston noted in

97
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,840
something he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote in two thousand that</font>

98
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,329
decided reports in his opinion did

99
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,860
provide good incentives for operators to

100
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:46,500
improve their irrigation behavior and so

101
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,750
why did it work if this is sort of very

102
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,310
hard to you know ascertain with any

103
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,630
certainty but in talking to people

104
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,020
talking to operation other people in the

105
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,640
community these are sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that some of</font>

106
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,080
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they felt were the</font>

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,119
reasons why the side report actually had

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,530
the affected incident operators first

109
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,030
off if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just clueless and didn't</font>

110
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,010
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there was a better</font>

111
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,390
way that you could announcer<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes when</font>

112
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,010
your name popped up on inside reports

113
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,040
you know this it provided some

114
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,690
information to you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then</font>

115
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,859
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was sent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the entire not on</font>

116
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">list and because everyone was able to</font>

117
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,729
see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who the other top 30 were</font>

118
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,380
on the list the social forces in this

119
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:20,169
community we're also able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

120
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,930
effect on

121
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,040
operator behavior so this includes you

122
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,870
know if you're worried about appearing

123
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the report you may feel some shame</font>

124
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,690
and wishing to maintain your reputation

125
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,840
in the community and adjusted behavior

126
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,910
and you don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> your appears may care</font>

127
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,580
but what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and so they apply</font>

128
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,080
peer pressure to you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in these</font>

129
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,849
meetings on the mailing list or in other

130
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,169
dealings that you have them and then

131
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,310
finally there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> this weird kind of</font>

132
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,770
hybrid of all three<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cider</font>

133
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,260
police that existed back in the late 90s

134
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">and early 2000s that was talked about 9i</font>

135
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">27th where they actually would call it</font>

136
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,390
people on the side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of report and say do</font>

137
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,039
you know you can announce your routes

138
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,490
better and work with them to deal with

139
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,930
this and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we move forward to the</font>

140
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,630
present and the question is is the cider

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,260
to operators in other people in this

143
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,120
community it seems a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people feel</font>

144
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,590
that the the sentiments were like you

145
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,360
know it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work anymore but it did</font>

146
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,700
work some in years ago when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard you</font>

147
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,560
know various numbers of n similarly I

148
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,490
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is tan gentle but some people</font>

149
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,720
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really matter anymore</font>

150
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the scaling problem has been</font>

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,659

<font color="#E5E5E5">whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two classes transition and so you</font>

154
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">know again maybe the side report doesn't</font>

155
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,180
really matter however no one as far as I

156
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,410
could tell had done any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

157
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,700
empirical study to say did the side

report actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> caused people to change</font>

159
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:37,300
their behavior be on anecdotes and so

160
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,500
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where this work comes out of so</font>

161
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,730
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> define a fact of how do we</font>

162
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,400
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if the side record actually</font>

163
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:45,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">caused behavior change so our hypothesis</font>

164
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,810
is that if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cider port works and if</font>

165
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,070
this the you know if there's a social

166
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,910
forces have an effect in causing people

167
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,200
to wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve their behavior then</font>

168
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,910
they should once they appear on the side

169
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,469
report their dairy their aggregation

170
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,370
behavior should improve it's pretty

171
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,200
simple but this is what we're going to

172
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,000
look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the remainder of this so</font>

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,830
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the red box here's you</font>

174
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,440
know do you improve your behavior one

175
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,419
soup here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the side of report we look</font>

176
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,590
at aggregate behavior in two ways I'm

177
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,810
Williams taco<font color="#CCCCCC"> in one here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

178
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,390
aggregation factor you can also look at

179
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,040
it in the raw number of we're done in

180
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:19,930
prefixes that in a SS advertising but

181
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,550
I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about that here so</font>

182
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,980
in terms of actually measuring the

183
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,030
aggregation behavior of a esas it would

184
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,830
have been really nice to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to just</font>

185
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,260
go to the side report on the noun list

186
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,370
archives pull them parse them and you

187
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,280
know say does you know a s

188
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,870
drop once they first appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> however</font>

189
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,900
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relative ranking of the side</font>

190
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,760

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really ambiguous what happens when</font>

192
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,760
someone drops off the 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they</font>

193
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,139
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better or did someone else</font>

194
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,260
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get worse and pushed them off the</font>

195
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:49,940
bottom and so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to</font>

196
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,409
re-implement the side report it was a

197
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,469
little bit different than the version

198
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff Houston is using we used Road</font>

200
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,590
aggressively fairly aggressively

201
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,590
canonicalize the AAS pass by removing

204
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,130

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,940
differences between are the reports but

209
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,109
they were generally reasonably

210
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:22,789
consistent so this plot shows once so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

211
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,710
guess sorry did the problem that we then

212
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:26,570
have once we have all this data for

213
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,260
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single it's not just the top 30 is</font>

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,460
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you know once it appears</font>

215
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,710
does its behavior changes so the way we

216
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,150
measure this is by sampling at various

217
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,280
times once it appears and so what this

218
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,950
plot is illustrating here is this is for

219
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,780
a single a s the black curve which jumps

220

they also improve or do they also not

it is net gain this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the measure that</font>

one if your larger yes and you you know

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,300
every irrigate more relatively you're

263
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,890
gonna have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge net gain where's</font>

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,660
we're ready to go to the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to</font>

267
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,130
see what we found over time so in the

268
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,860
next few slides I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of</font>

269
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,870
build this up in a few pieces i'm going

270
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you the way be the improvement</font>

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,290
eighty 2001 and so what we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

275
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,980
here is a CDF a cumulative distribution

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,670
this time and for those of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

280
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at CD s off and the way to read</font>

281
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,069
this basically used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick a point oops</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">tipping point so you can say let's say I</font>

00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,620
want to say how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much of the population</font>

284
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,989
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> addie irrigation factor of two or</font>

285
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">less so you look up into the lefty and</font>

286
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,310
say that forty percent have to or<font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

287
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,490
and oh and the other thing I should

288
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:10,290
mention is this is the deviation factor

289
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:14,370
initially as soon as they appear on the

290
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,689
side report so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now the deviation</font>

291
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,570
factor or the same assets that appeared

292
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,520
on the side report 730 days two years

293
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,140
later following that initial appearance

294
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,240
and so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that the curve is</font>

295
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,310
moved to the left so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same way</font>

296
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,480
of reading it as before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can see if we</font>

297
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,189
go up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and over to the left now</font>

298
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,380
eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the population has the</font>

299
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,820
aggregation factor of two or less so

300
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,080
there there has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> an improvement in</font>

301
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,850
the in the deaeration that

302
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,510
the population<font color="#CCCCCC"> that appear on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this head</font>

303
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,950
report is it's currently doing now

304
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,480
finally quickly the control groups this

305
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the a esas that never appeared on it</font>

306
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,510
this is the CDF off them initially

307
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,370
following their<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point at which we</font>

308
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,260
selected them and then two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years after</font>

309
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that point you can see that they tend to</font>

310
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">D a great a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit so they move in</font>

311
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,580
the opposite direction that a s is on

312
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,650
the side report appear and so we put

313
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">these together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we can see that there</font>

314
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,180
was a significant improvement obvious

315
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,670
that appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the side report in the in</font>

316
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">this time period the end the control</font>

317
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,240
group of the other way so now we'll go

318
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,790
ahead the next time select<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time</font>

319
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,990
series and so we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

320
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,459
behavior difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> is changed a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

321
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,040
bit the control group looks the same

322
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,770
with the treatment group the group that

323
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,829
 that appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the side report has</font>

324
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:29,930
has decreased not much change in the

325
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">next time period and then finally we</font>

326
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,819
moved to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> latin most recent time</font>

327
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,980
period this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 2007 to 2009 and you can</font>

328
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,960
see that there's a little change between

329
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> their first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> appearance and two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

330
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that first appearance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the group</font>

331
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,150
that appears in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SATA report and</font>

332
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,339
again the control group remains roughly

333
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,980
the same so this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest the</font>

334
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">setter you know appearing in the side</font>

335
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:55,190
report doesn't is an associated as much

336
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:57,530
changes at once was so interpreting this

337
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,050
data how do we interpret<font color="#E5E5E5"> this first the</font>

338
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:02,750
control groups are consistent over time

339
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:06,229
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggests that there and so this</font>

340
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just there wasn't you know there</font>

341
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,170
wasn't some change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in behavior all asses</font>

342
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,480
that you know they control group remain

343
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,800
roughly the same and so the behavior

344
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,330
change we noticed it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

345
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">associated with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> de esas that appear</font>

346
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,840
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the report and as i</font>

347
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned the improvement of the</font>

348
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,200
aggregation factor has decreased over

349
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,090
time so this suggests and I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

350
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be absolutely certain about</font>

351
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,820
this but there wasn't a change

352
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,590
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> appearance I'd report</font>

353
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that change has since gone away so</font>

354
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,070
if you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the side report was</font>

355
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,569
what caused this behavior change you

356
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,240
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> then conclude that it's probably</font>

357
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,650
no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> effective there are some</font>

358
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,590
confounding factors here that I just

359
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,720
should point out first is selection bias

360
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,070
and this is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what this</font>

361
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,260
means is that the a s is that appear on

362
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the side report may be intrinsically</font>

363
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,020
different than other risks in the

364
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,400
network and indeed they are you know

365
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,600
often

366
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,540
large access providers or things like

367
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,430
that and so we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be measuring</font>

368
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,870
something else about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them this is</font>

369
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to control for and similarly</font>

370
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,310
the regression to the mean what this

371
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,900
means is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you appear on the</font>

372
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,040
side report you necessarily appear there

373
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,750
because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something weird</font>

374
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,219
you're an outlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

375
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">accident and then you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

376
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,760
normal and we're measuring it's possible

377
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could be measuring that return</font>

378
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,060
to normal rather than actually an

379
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,589
improvement caused by this header report

380
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,930
again these are difficult to control for

381
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,820
because i'm using historical data and

382
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,689
not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that where we set up a</font>

383
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,010
nice controlled experiment so if you

384
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,840
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side report once was</font>

385
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:30,069
effective and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no longer why did it</font>

386
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,090
change talking to operators<font color="#CCCCCC"> I gathered a</font>

387
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,410
bunch of theories and you know who

388
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,760
certainly appreciate your thoughts as to

389
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,800
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think these theories are a</font>

390
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,870
reasonable or not but the first I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

391
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,910
is that ribbon<font color="#E5E5E5"> fib slots are much more</font>

392
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:43,060
plentiful now and so there's less pain

393
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,589
your concern about you know people

394
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,540
injecting a few extra prefixes into the

395
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,000
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and conversely you doing the same</font>

396
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,680
there's not the same motivation to you

397
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,080
know be unhappy but especially because

398
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,969
as well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe the the Internet</font>

399
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,180
routing table does not dominate you know

400
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:01,660
what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to put in their fifth</font>

401
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,130
these days similarly the there is

402
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,180
arguably and I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know people</font>

403
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">have different opinions on this but</font>

404
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,359
there's arguably an increased need for

405
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,850
the aggregation now where's this maybe

406
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,770
wasn't the case in the early 90s and

407
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,940
finally the community response and this

408
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,800
may be because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these first two things</font>

409
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,030
but the community responds to appearing

410
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,410
on the side report has changed and

411
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:21,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's what this plot down here shows</font>

412
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:24,160
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the showing the frequency of</font>

included praise so and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> did a good job</font>

425
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,150
and reducing the prefix count and this

426
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,250
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can see since maybe 2005 with</font>

427
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:58,750
a few outliers this is pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much gone</font>

428
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:01,090
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so finally we shift gears the</font>

429
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,070
last part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this and this is not</font>

430
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at ASB</font>

431
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,500
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore but its terms of general</font>

432
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,810
observations about the report<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

433
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,090
made that if you wanted to improve the

434
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,520
report this might be some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

435
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,720
at and the thing I would point out is

436
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,600
that the side report has remained you

437
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">know effectively unchanged since its</font>

438
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,400
origins in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid-90s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> during the cider</font>

439
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,810
transition and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has grown</font>

440
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and changed number of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> esas in the</font>

441
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,569
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you know grown</font>

442
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,990
significantly and yet the reporters

443
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,010
remain the same and so it might if the

444
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,360
side report something that people still

445
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,150
care about it might be better to refocus

446
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,760
it and so the first pot I'll show you

447
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,670
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a another CDF and what you're</font>

448
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,420
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at here is a the distribution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

452
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,660
the important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see here I guess</font>

453
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,040
number one is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the different</font>

colored bars it looks like a rainbow are

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,699
the different distributions for

different years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing table as</font>

457
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,400
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it hasn't changed much</font>

458
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,680
the you know this it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as though the</font>

462
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,530
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means is that with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

463
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,470
fixed to top 30 the you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top</font>

464
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:19,319
30 of 30 some thousand de esas now is

465
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,850
much more extreme than the top 30 a few

466
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,310
thousand de esas back in the mid-90s and

467
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,290
this is illustrated with the tube are

468
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,599
the two sort of lines at the very top

469
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand side you can see the</font>

470
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,070
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 1998 line was maybe you know at</font>

471
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,870
the 99th percentile and a distance moved

472
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,100
out to be less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one-tenth</font>

473
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,380
of one percent and so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

474
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,110
looking at extreme behavior because the

475
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,020
side report is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> only top 30</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

476
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,220
that's I can see why I mean it would be

477
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,329
tedious to plod through like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a</font>

478
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple hundred entries in the side</font>

479
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:50,730
report every week but this is just one

480
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,920
of the side effects of that and

481
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,860
similarly the top of the report has

482
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,410
become static and what this plot shows

483
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,260
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of prefixes that you need</font>

484
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,050
to or the number of prefixes that you

485
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,060
need to announce that are the aggregated

486
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:09,300
in order to achieve a certain rank on

487
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the side of report and so the top part</font>

488
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,438
here is if you want to be number

489
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,880
on the side report this is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

490
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,339
redundant prefixes you need to announce

491
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,689
so it's not insignificant it's you know

492
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,480
you can see how it's changed over time

493
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:24,110
as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top five or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

494
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,939
red to green bars the blues and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

495
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">green is sore sorry the purple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 the</font>

496
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:29,450
median and finally the bottom of the

497
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,070
report is 30 there's almost an order of

498
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,400
magnitude change between the top and the

499
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,980
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> mm-hmm and as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said this may be</font>

500
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,840
because you know indeed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ER large</font>

501
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,450
operators in the top and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they may be</font>

502
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">harrogate you know what might not be an</font>

503
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,110
unreasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount but because they're</font>

504
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,639
large they pop up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top and this</font>

505
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,800
and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to displace them</font>

506
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,480
and so the top of your static that

507
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,070
appears not to change so finally seeing

508
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,150
all this and seeing the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

509
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,059
fact that the side report<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe is not</font>

510
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:02,210
doing as much as it did the question is

511
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:03,649
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do something about it and I'm</font>

512
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,940
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have opinions about</font>

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,300

515
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,610
unclear whether running a little growth

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is a pain point now or whether</font>

it will be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the near future you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

523
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,480
the cider court would be the best way to

00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,830
start dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this problem again as</font>

541
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,809
might be possible to refocus it or to

542
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,820
include other things in it that might

543
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,649
lead to more actionable behavior and so

544
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,300
the first thing here would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was just</font>

545
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,650
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of putting the</font>

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">people on the top that maybe you're</font>

547
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:14,540
unwilling to change or can't change we

548
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,070
can also look at low hanging fruit

549
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,420
people that you know don't seem to have

550
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,740
any reason to be you know they're not

551
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,510

valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aggregation</font>

555
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,590
or it there isn't even a good reason why

556
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,240
or similarly people that are recent

557

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,560
behavior and so I agree some of these

562
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,379
things might be unfair but I don't know

563
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,379
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do that it would change you</font>

564
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,590
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do sort of you know worse</font>

565
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:50,020
than we're doing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and so</font>

566
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:52,030
finally to conclude just to recap

567
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,290
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked about as i said</font>

568
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,149
the side reports seem to be effective in

569
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,440
its early days it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to tell you</font>

570
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,880
know with causality to say that yes the

571
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,590
side report was the cause of this change

572
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,470
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a behavior change</font>

573
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,510
associated with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> s is appearing on</font>

574
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,490
the side of report this seems to change

575
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,950
over time and as a mission there's hot

576
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,750
there's probably a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reasons why</font>

577
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,590
and probably related to the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

578
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,560
change and evolution of the Internet

579
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:17,919
over time the side report in contrast

580
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,060
hasn't evolved which is fine but if we

581
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,530
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve it we probably could</font>

582
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,960
improve it with you know focusing on

583
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:25,899
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of behavior and finally</font>

584
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,270
just to spend a moment on this I do

585
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write off the social</font>

586
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">forces in you know amongst the operator</font>

587
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,500
communities way of changing behavior and

588
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,870
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have good</font>

589
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,730
clean technical solutions you know I

590
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that the net on meetings</font>

591
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:44,500
exist then analysts you know all the

592
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,880
discussion and takes place on it and you

593
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,130
guys deal with each other in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

594
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,350
forms as well I do think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

595
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,240
something to be said for the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

596
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,919
social aspect to this in the cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

597
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,320
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an easy tactical solution</font>

598
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,820
and so I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be you</font>

599
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,899
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't these solutions are not</font>

600
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,669
easy when you want to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

601
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but I someone think we need you</font>

602
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,630
know should be absolutely pessimistic

603
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:07,480
about using social forces to solve

604
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,130
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and with that I would leave you</font>

605
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,190
with a couple things my email address if

606
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,990
you want to ask me a question or you

607
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,090
know criticize me or send me some

608
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,560
information if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

609
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this URL this is my thesis where it</font>

610
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,909
contains much more detail with all this

611
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,020
and finally this picture I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

612
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,820
was kind of cool this is our first

613
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,010
attempt at visualizing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> set of</font>

614
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">reports as you can see the behavior</font>

615
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,390
change over time kind of each color is a

616
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,590
different a s and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font>

617
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,640
tops kind of static the bottoms kind of

618
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,810
all chocolate this wasn't all

619
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,890
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for what we're trying to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

620
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:42,480
so we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love to take questions</font>

621
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so please step up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mics and</font>

622
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,200
identify yourself with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name your</font>

623
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,280
affiliation and we'll start over<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

624
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,280
side hi my name is jared montz from new

625
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,190
century ah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a couple comments</font>

626
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,490
first of all one a year ago there was a

627
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:03,120
talk at the Atlanta nanog about a

628
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,400
similar topic and bellsouth I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

629
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically called out bellsouth at the</font>

630
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,500
the microphone there it was approached

631
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,180
privately afterwards indicating that

632
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,410
this is part of integration efforts it

633
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,930
doesn't appear that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> made any</font>

634
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,820
progress over the past year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I</font>

635
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:22,260
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to call them out again</font>

636
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:24,689
publicly or ask that their parent

637
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:27,840
company AT&T be able to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take some</font>

638
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,810
action against them and either aggregate

639
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,899
that upstream for them or you know take

640
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:36,149
part in sort of the those integration

641
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,040
activities to go and suppress those

642
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,750
routes because that's about 3,000 routes

643
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,030
or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in the table that doesn't</font>

644
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,440
need to be there and I'd hope that

645
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,290
they'd be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something about</font>

646
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,550
that the second thing about the routing

647
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:52,460
slot a situation I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that part of</font>

648
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:56,159
your assumptions are true to a point

649
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,780
were with fib compression and some of

650
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,420
the other techniques and algorithms that

651
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,510
can be employed we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

652
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,370
approaching sort of the new wall and the

653
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,650
new wall that exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now is</font>

654
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:10,080
somewhere is going to be somewhere

655
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">around the 512 thousand routes entry</font>

656
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,550
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people have switched to</font>

657
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,350
t<font color="#CCCCCC"> cam based platforms for their</font>

658
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,419
forwarding and they have specific

659
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,600
partitions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that we're going</font>

660
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:23,880
to see you know us bump<font color="#CCCCCC"> up against that</font>

661
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,620
because you have people's internal

662
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,140
routes as well as the externally visible

663
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,060
ones that come into play and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

664
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:34,710
goes internally and I think that that

665
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:37,500
512 barrier is really going to be sort

666
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:41,550
of the ceiling<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see for a period</font>

667
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:43,230
of time as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to see the</font>

668
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,790
routing table growth as it is and you

669
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,960
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to project out when</font>

670
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,760
that's going to happen and one we're

671
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the bump against that some</font>

672
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,620
of the platforms you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can carve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

673
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,479
differently

674
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:55,590
but that requires maintenance Azure

675
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,390
outages and not everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> has done that</font>

676
00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:02,100
because thats a shared resource with

677
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:03,240
other protocols like mpls or ipv6 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

678
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">people privately worried about this</font>

679
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sudden</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lincoln</font>

680
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,600
hidden sir are people thinking about

681
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,629
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal team they just haven't</font>

682
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,090
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it as much I think in my</font>

683
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,320
prior role at a major carrier I this was

684
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:18,659
definitely something that I thought

685
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:21,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">about as it related to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh where the the</font>

686
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:25,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">FIB and rib was ultimately going to hit</font>

687
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:27,510
and watching that growth curve really

688
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,610
the 512 barrier is really what concerned

689
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:33,679
me the most because you run into

690
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:36,059
situations where you have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

691
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,070
redeploy hardware and when you're

692
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,690
talking about major capital expenditures

693
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,340
in the leads time and logistics

694
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,920
associated with that it becomes very

695
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,510
complex and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I suspect that as we</font>

696
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach some of those barriers you're</font>

697
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:52,620
going to see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> variety of forces at play</font>

698
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,480
either market<font color="#E5E5E5"> forces may come into play</font>

699
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:58,110
with financial charging per outing slot

700
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,080
you know Alice<font color="#E5E5E5"> print or as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lashaunda</font>

who can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big difference actually</font>

704
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,220
going and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know trying to keep under</font>

705
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,010
that barrier as they approach you

706
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,250
internally so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comments</font>

707
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:20,610
about this thank you right over here

708
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:23,520
please Michael Sinatra ESN um thanks for

709
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:26,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the reply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat analysis actually it</font>

710
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,730
occurs to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the which is a brief</font>

711
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:33,479
picky comment the the notion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

712
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:36,540
sort of social pressure has been taken

713
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,510
off of operators to aggregate is more of

714
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,879
an effect than a cause and so I don't

715
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,580
think if it makes good sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to see</font>

716
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,380
that as a cause but to see both the

717
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,449
ineffectiveness of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> site or report</font>

718
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,460
and the lack of social pressure as being

719
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,230
an effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> of something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

720
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,179
to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out I think if we figure out</font>

721
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,070
what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is then where the</font>

722
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,350
analysis has a much more powerful

723
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">message at that point so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's</font>

724
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">really all I had to say at this point</font>

725
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:05,129
so you have to close the mics here next

726
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:07,269
question on this side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the room yeah</font>

727
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:10,869
how Martin leave you hurricane electric

728
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:13,779
a couple of points the report as good as

729
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:16,988
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for the longevity is has never</font>

730
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:18,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">really addressed the fact that operators</font>

731
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:20,559
in certain parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

732
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:24,968
traffic engineering and their primary

733
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:30,549
taught task is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aggregation now that</font>

734
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:31,959
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that probably the high end the</font>

735
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,699
high end people on the report are

736
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:36,159
probably going way past<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they</font>

737
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:37,779
should but the point is the report makes

738
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,549
has always made this assumption that

739
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,219
everything should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> D aggregated down</font>

740
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:43,539
to the minimum allocation minimum cider

741
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:45,009
block and be done with it and that

742
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:47,549
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't the case for a lot of</font>

743
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:50,199
operators out there second point is that

744
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:52,749
although this is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in Phil Smith's</font>

745
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:58,149
report at the moment AAS path length

746
00:26:52,749 --> 00:27:00,789
prepending of excessive style is called

747
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:02,589
out and just from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a peer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pressure point</font>

748
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:05,319
of view you can take some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

749
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:07,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">end players on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do a personal</font>

750
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,979
email and say hey why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing this</font>

751
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:10,899
why can't use some other control like

752
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:13,809
communities and actually make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

753
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:17,129
difference so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s path length is really</font>

754
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:19,149
got a different processing issue than

755
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:22,139
just dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of routes</font>

756
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:25,839
third thing is there's a reality here

757
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:27,938
upstream operators type kind of like

758
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">their customers with large d</font>

759
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:32,709
aggregations because when they have lots

760
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:36,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">of routes they look bigger and that</font>

761
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:39,059
simple pressure alone will continue so

762
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,199
it's it's unclear as you go up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chain</font>

763
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,939
that you you actually have as much

764
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:45,009
pressure as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe you do back to</font>

765
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:49,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">the the actual customer that's doing the</font>

766
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:51,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">D aggregation the final point about</font>

767
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:53,408
about just the size and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll</font>

768
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:56,349
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that not the 512 side of it</font>

769
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:58,959
but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the growth of this look look at</font>

770
00:27:56,349 --> 00:28:02,349
simple economics look at the barrier to

771
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:04,509
entry in the marketplace if a small

772
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:07,928
operator can't afford a router with a

773
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:11,109
large<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcam or memory size or processing</font>

774
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:12,940
to handle these big tables then they're

775
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:14,290
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game so guess what the people</font>

776
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">who have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the money people who</font>

777
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:18,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">who can invest in this and people are</font>

778
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,870
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build large backbones will</font>

779
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,330
continue to not worry about the size of

780
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the routing tables yeah personally it</font>

781
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,080
doesn't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> good but if it's if it</font>

782
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,340
kicks one of my competitors out of the

783
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,010
business hey I'm happy that's economics

784
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:35,649
thank you over here in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

785
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:40,060
first of all thank you we're sitting out

786
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:42,490
here going data control groups it's just

787
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:46,990
a little weird for us so appreciate you

788
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:48,640
bringing some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the site</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

789
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,710
report you know you mentioned causality

790
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,970
is very difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find there's more</font>

791
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,010
than just whether the site of report

792
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,620
made people drop their routes I'm

793
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,150
wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plans I know</font>

794
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> change schools and stuff but you</font>

795
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,590
have any plans to look at other effects

796
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,449
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does being on the site</font>

797
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:07,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">of report in any way make someone filter</font>

798
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:09,070
you more<font color="#CCCCCC"> stringently because even if UD</font>

799
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,290
aggregate if everyone filters you it's

800
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,550
irrelevant right and there are other

801
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,790
pressures that other people have brought

802
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:17,820
up here even at the mics<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font>

803
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:21,340
nothing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not the</font>

804
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:23,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person d aggregating aggregates or</font>

805
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,770
not and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to add on to something</font>

806
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:28,510
Martin said one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these social</font>

807
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,610
pressures could be for instance to take

808
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:33,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of routes out of peering</font>

809
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,540
requirements large networks frequently

810
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,909
say you must announce this many routes

811
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:39,310
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to do if UD aggregate</font>

812
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,230
right so maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> pure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pressure can be that</font>

813
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,700
is a stupid peering requirement of

814
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,020
course everybody probably knows I think

815
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,750
every repairing requirement is stupid

816
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,370
but that's beside the point and finally

817
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm good luck with the next guy if you</font>

818
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,629
don't know who he is yes I was worried

819
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,790
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we're going to be brief</font>

820
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,310
because we're a little over on time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

821
00:29:54,790 --> 00:30:00,129
Jeff Houston I<font color="#CCCCCC"> henoch yeah thanks for</font>

823
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,840
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> report is a combination of</font>

824
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:08,200
whatever I dreamt up whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> Phil and</font>

825
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:11,020
Tony had done before and the amount of

stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had wanted to be</font>

830
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,840
you want in it so what you get is you

00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,360
know the combination of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

832
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,000

but you know tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me first because</font>
