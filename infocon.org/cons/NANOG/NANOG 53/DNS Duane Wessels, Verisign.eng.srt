earth cooled tcp/ip was invented dns was

9

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,330
it makes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great system for for</font>

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,420

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,460
why we're here today so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to be clear</font>

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,500
this is the kind of attack that I'm

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,710
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about where there's a bad guy</font>

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,570
who can spoof packets and he sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,940
to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> authoritative name server and</font>

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:50,879
that name server sends a response to the

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,820
victim some particular is about about

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,550
the attacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:59,510
these are occasional attacks that were

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,080
reflecting off of the root nameservers

22
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:06,390
beginning sometime in early 2010 and

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,990
continuing for quite a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> for most of</font>

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,270
that year typical load of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this attack</font>

25
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,119
when it started was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6,000 queries</font>

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,590
per second and towards the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">year it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his hires about 15,000</font>

28
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:24,330
queries per second so as a comparison

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,059
each each letter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the root server</font>

30
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,310
system typically sees between ten to

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,930
thirty thousand queries per second

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,790
during normal operations these attacks

33
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,280
would tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to last for one or two days</font>

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:43,950
sometimes less not not often longer and

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,840
one sort of distinguishing

36
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,970
characteristic was that the query names

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,229
in the attacks was always the same or

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,229
very consistent

39
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,329
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally it's really hard to get good</font>

40
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,069
data out of the the root servers but as

41
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,949
luck would have it at this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

42
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,799
going through the ders deployment you

43
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,869
know adding DNS SEC to the root zone and

44
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,780
there were sort of about every three

45
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,730
weeks there would be a new incremental

46
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,049
deployment and all the roots of

47
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,209
reporters would do another data

48
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:23,970
collection and they were uploading all

49
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:26,099
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data to DNS work so that data is</font>

50
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,380
is they are dark and that's the data

51
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I analyzed for this it's it's</font>

52
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:35,010
actually quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data each one of</font>

53
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,379
these little charts here represents one

54
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,518
data collection period from from the

55
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,950
root server letters that are shown on

56
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,690
the y-axis here so they were about let's

57
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,780
see I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there were nine separate</font>

58
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,290
eight or nine separate data collection

59
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,700
periods you know some of the letters

60
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,140
were better at participating that than

61
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:59,518
others but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quite a lot of</font>

62
00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:02,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">data to go through so you know to get a</font>

63
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle this what I did was went through</font>

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,780
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data that we had and extracted</font>

65
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:11,720
the queries that ended with these two

66
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,220
names<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we saw in the attack traffic</font>

67
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,310
so they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been somewhat anonymous here</font>

68
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:21,510
but all of the queries ended with one of

69
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:25,769
two second-level domain names so to that

70
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:28,349
I used this program called DNS cap which

71
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:32,459
can filter on names and this process

72
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:34,858
took quite a long time one just<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

73
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,139
reason is just because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

74
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,579
let it start it and let it run<font color="#E5E5E5"> for as</font>

75
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,599
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it would run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and luckily you</font>

76
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the server stayed up for many</font>

77
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,230
months and eventually it finished in and

78
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,489
then I got around to actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

79
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,649
the data there's a little at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom</font>

80
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:54,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the slide there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little extract of</font>

81
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,319
how the queries would look in TCP dump

82
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:00,280
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to was to put all</font>

83
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,260
those queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> into an SQL database</font>

84
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,969
here's an exciting SQL table just just

85
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:10,999
to show you that I'm serious about SQL

86
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:12,769
I'm not joking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so from</font>

87
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:15,500
from this SQL database then I could run

88
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:18,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SQL queries to sort</font>

89
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:23,840
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the data in different ways so</font>

90
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:26,750
I I defined an attack event as when at

91
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,150
the start of an event is when at least

92
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,509
one name server sees at least 50,000

93
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:35,719
course per second for either of these

94
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:38,990
two names and it ends when none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

95
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,599
see that level of traffic and if there's

96
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,070
a gap of five minutes or more I say

97
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,509
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start of a new attack event</font>

98
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,130
so there were different numbers of

99
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:53,030
attack events in the different data

100
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:55,969
collection periods you can see for

101
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,340
example on march 23rd there were four

102
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:02,690
different attack events and actually a

103
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:05,000
number another definition of an attack

104
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,560
event was the second-level domain had to

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,840
be the same so there's two names in

106
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,849
there and I think I separated name one a

107
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:16,250
name to into two separate events if they

108
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:18,729
happen to occur simultaneously here's a

109
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,560
graph<font color="#CCCCCC"> that shows the traffic levels</font>

110
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:24,080
during one of the attacks so this was an

111
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,120
early one in January and you can see

112
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,419
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's pretty flat pretty</font>

113
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,630
consistent at about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6500 queries per</font>

114
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:34,460
second and all of the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know almost</font>

115
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the roots of her letters that we</font>

116
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,909
have data<font color="#E5E5E5"> for are at the very top there</font>

117
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:44,419
you can see this this blue one here<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

118
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:45,979
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> je root and this does not</font>

119
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:49,159
represent a loss of<font color="#CCCCCC"> service but it</font>

120
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:51,919
represents a loss of collection a loss

121
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:55,490
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data collection so what likely</font>

122
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,049
happened here was the the site where the

123
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">data was being collected this attack</font>

124
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,960
caused the disks to fill up and then no

125
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:02,360
more data could be collected after that

126
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,650
time so for the most part it's flat

127
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,199
there's there's a few dips here and

128
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:10,969
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

129
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:14,400
here's an his another look at that same

130
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:16,169
event so for each of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went</font>

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,989
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just detailed the</font>

132
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:22,469
start time to stop time the the maximum

133
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:25,800
and the mean query rates the names that

134
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">were seen in all cases these were all</font>

135
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,020
queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> of type 1 these were all a</font>

136
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:33,120
queries and I listed the source

137
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,219
addresses that we saw and the source

138
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,680
addresses were always kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like this</font>

139
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:42,320
you know between one and five unique

140
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,669
sources we assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're spoofed</font>

141
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,139
some sources were a little bit more

142
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:48,570
popular than others for whatever reason

143
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,190
and between attack events the sources

144
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,070
tended to change so there was not a lot

145
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:55,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">of consistency</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the sources between</font>

146
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:58,800
attacks however there was a lot of

147
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,979
consistency<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the servers that were</font>

148
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,940
being hit during the attacks so this

149
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:07,440
this table here shows the these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

150
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,840
actually the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server and the node</font>

151
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,940
names that that we used at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> toe arc</font>

152
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,150
when collecting the data and the the

153
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,740
node names or the site names tend to you

154
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,200
know encode their location there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

155
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:25,070
of airport codes in here like JFK and

156
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:29,010
LGA LaGuardia and so on there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miami so</font>

157
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:31,349
these happen to be very consistent over

158
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:35,520
time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> each event you know we would</font>

159
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:37,889
always see you know I routes traffic at

160
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:44,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Washington node and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay routes</font>

161
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:46,139
traffic at the bombay node and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

162
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,799
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I already said everything</font>

163
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,800
on this slide

164
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,340
so this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular attack was a</font>

165
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,020
little bit different it's it's perhaps

166
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,150
not immediately obvious from this slide

167
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,799
why it's different but it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with</font>

168
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,909
what's what's going on here in this

169
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:12,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">region there was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number of sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

170
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:15,830
stalactites if you will of drops and

171
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:20,810
this is the list of the servers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw</font>

172
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:21,919
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> during this attack event and one</font>

173
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,170
of the really interesting things was

174
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,330
that for the first time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this event we</font>

175
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,900
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic at sites that we had never</font>

176
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:32,630
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for f there was some</font>

177
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:36,650
traffic at the Amsterdam node for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay</font>

178
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:40,130
there was i forget what<font color="#CCCCCC"> jsu is now san</font>

179
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:42,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">juan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe 4k route there was you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic at their links node and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4l route</font>

181
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,380
there was traffic at their<font color="#CCCCCC"> Los Angeles</font>

182
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:51,949
node so that you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font>

183
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:57,189
that's pretty interesting and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> graph</font>

184
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">shows sort of zoomed in in time where</font>

185
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,360
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic for each server was</font>

186
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,750
was hitting and you can see for example

187
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,820
like on this this line for<font color="#E5E5E5"> k route you</font>

188
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:11,090
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> along at the normal</font>

189
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,130
location which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Napa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

190
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Americas and then you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> popped up two</font>

191
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,630
links<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then down back to the nap</font>

192
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Americas and did this and for all of the</font>

193
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,439
sites for all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers excuse me for</font>

194
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,300
all the servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that saw a traffic shift</font>

195
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,610
they all shifted it the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

196
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:32,229
these sort of three events so this seems

197
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:35,990
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of glitch in in where</font>

198
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,120
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> was traffic to any cast enabled</font>

199
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,510
servers shifted at exactly the same time

200
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,950
on these three or four sites so you know

201
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,370
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to be some kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

202
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,990
routing problem and since it affected

203
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,180
everybody at the same time we assume

204
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:54,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it happened close to the the real</font>

205
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:56,750
source of the traffic so you know the

206
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,189
hypothesis as well perhaps the normal

207
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,940
traffic was affected in exactly the same

208
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:04,360
way here's a cartoon sort of you know

209
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,640
showing the idea here

210
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was perhaps a disrupted bgp</font>

211
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,290
session that caused that traffic to to

212
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,149
not go there and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it shipped it to</font>

213
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:19,329
these other as other three sites for

214
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:21,550
those any casts root servers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i made a</font>

215
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:24,899
sort of a fingerprint of of the times

216
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:28,180
when the traffic shift did and which

217
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:31,959
servers that shifted to here's the table

218
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:34,390
for again this is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> f</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route so at</font>

219
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,949
these times the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in two</font>

220
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,750
columns<font color="#E5E5E5"> these times the traffic went to</font>

221
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">this node and then to this node and flip</font>

222
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,610
back and forth and so by looking for

223
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:44,829
real traffic that shifted in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact</font>

224
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:49,870
same way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with this list of IP</font>

225
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:52,060
addresses so all of these addresses for

226
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,040
these three root servers shifted at

227
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,760
exactly the same time in the in the same

228
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:01,170
way so it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out all of these almost</font>

229
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:05,079
all of those addresses fall within these

230
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:13,269
six or so net blocks which are announced

231
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:17,620
by as2 1788 here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the who is record for</font>

232
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:20,740
for this further for those networks this

233
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,510
is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know anyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font>

234
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">this company of this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> P but they are</font>

235
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,890
also known<font color="#E5E5E5"> as verse net and they're a</font>

236
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,540
company that sort of specializes in

237
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:33,640
hosting and and virtual services and

238
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,810
that kind of thing so and other things

239
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of makes sense here is that</font>

240
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,949
you know this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> company is located in</font>

241
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:42,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the US East Coast which makes sense sort</font>

242
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:44,800
of any<font color="#CCCCCC"> caste why's that those that</font>

243
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:50,050
traffic would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be hitting root servers on</font>

244
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">the US east coast and in Europe so to</font>

245
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,209
take this a step further one is sort of

246
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:58,540
more confirmation and went back through

247
00:11:55,209 --> 00:12:03,089
the other attack events to see if the

248
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,800
traffic from as2 1788 always at the same

249
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,779
nodes as the attract traffic was hitting

250
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,819
so it was you know it's nearly a hundred

251
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,699
percent match<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a bunch of boring</font>

252
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,260
you know tables that show in almost all

253
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,260
cases it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 100%</font>

254
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,589
so you know it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this that this</font>

255
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,050
routing glitch which feels to me like

256
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:29,779
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacker kind of</font>

257
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,729
inflicted upon themselves by sending so

258
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,589
much traffic through there is peace

259
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:37,400
router caused a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP session to reset</font>

260
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:39,830
sort of outed them if you will as to

261
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,860
their location but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

262
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,870
was kind of possible was because the

263
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,550
root servers you know it's it's a very

264
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,860
diverse set of servers all around the

265
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,180
world and and lots of different

266
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,029
organizations involved in running those

267
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,160
servers and lots of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast obviously</font>

268
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:57,200
and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the other thing that</font>

269
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,520
really enabled this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen was the</font>

270
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,600
massive amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

271
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,890
happened to be collecting at the same

272
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,120
time it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been asked of me you know is</font>

273
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this something that we could do in real</font>

274
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,380
time maybe if you had you know enough

275
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,459
enough machines and to throw out it but

276
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:17,750
you would really need some way to I

277
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:19,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">guess to force these bgp sessions to to</font>

278
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,050
be reset and you would need something

279
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the root server is a very diverse</font>

280
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:28,760
set of of any kites<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think to to be</font>

answer about about this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,960
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> my pound set from affiliates your</font>

last couple of statements there you're

285
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,370
saying it you kind of need more red and

286
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,030
glitches in order to try and do this in

287
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:52,860
real time but it said that that tipped

288
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,350
you off to what was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on but</font>

289
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't if you had enough data wouldn't</font>

290
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,120
you be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do that with normal</font>

291
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:05,420
traffic without the writing glitch<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

292
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:07,440
find find all the sources<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

293
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,079
talking to the st. always talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

294
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,690
same servers as as your attack traffic

295
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,310
and I mean it wouldn't it wouldn't be

296
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,200
quite as good because you yeah you'd

297
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,180
have you put you'd have some false

298
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,190
positives in there it might it might

299
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,469
help narrow it down a lot where the

300
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,510
potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources are yeah and that was</font>

301
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,520
I think that was kind of my plan when I

302
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,250
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with this and stumbling upon</font>

303
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,660
the switch was was<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of lucky you</font>

304
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,640
know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you're right i think</font>

305
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,910
you could attempt something like that

306
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,189
where you try to match yeah I much

307
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,560
broader set<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway it might at least you</font>

308
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,120
know give you you know 10 or 15 knocks

309
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
you have to call to say have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got a</font>

310
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,510
ridiculous amount of traffic coming out

311
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,390
towards this cert you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thing</font>

312
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:52,140
rather than you know right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

313
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:53,670
think so yeah jean-christophe<font color="#CCCCCC"> kim carr</font>

314
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,410
me just to follow up on Matt's comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

315
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,199
guess you you could try to triangulate

316
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,750
doing some trickery with your own

317
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">announcements or not just you maybe a</font>

318
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,080
collaboration between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> roots of</font>

319
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,790
whoever's involved in this by either you

320
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">know removing your routes or adjusting</font>

321
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,140
your peering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth and maybe</font>

322
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,120
announcing certain suspect asn so they

323
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,420
see a loop and then they you know do

324
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,910
something else perhaps so something yeah

325
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think so i think i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

326
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">not enough of a routing expert to say so</font>

327
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,550
i would rely on others to tell me what

328
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,550
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put in the router config to do that</font>

329
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:31,930
Kyle<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kreutz network um I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was curious if</font>

330
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:34,389
you were only examining a records or if

331
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,709
because aren't txt records usually used

332
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:40,389
in reflection attacks rather than hey

333
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:44,079
records that's that's true we were

334
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:46,329
collecting all the records and and this

335
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,008
attack traffic was only using a queries

336
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:49,748
for whatever reason I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know yeah</font>

337
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:51,850
though this doesn't seem to be a case

338
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:53,949
where they were relying on the size of

339
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:58,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the response but maybe just more on the</font>

340
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:58,139
the volume of the response traffic

341
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,010
ok
