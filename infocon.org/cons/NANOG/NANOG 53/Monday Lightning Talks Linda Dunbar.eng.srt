00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,139
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> update of what I</font>

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,900
Denver we rang on track<font color="#CCCCCC"> armd track have</font>

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,150
some people from operator<font color="#CCCCCC"> side to give</font>

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,580
the their view on the issues they see

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,788
the model data center address resolution

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,690
scaling issues and the goal of this talk

11
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,239
is really during our communication with

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,800
various data center operators some of

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,739
them have expressed that they don't

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want to disclose their issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

15
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,828
problems publicly and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just put</font>

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,780
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> some generic data center</font>

17
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:54,270
designs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pinpoints so hopefully we</font>

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,149
put it together here and mainly for you

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,070
operators to to challenge those issues

20
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,899
and challenge those designs and tell us

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,140
some of the designs are not correct or

22
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:08,610
give us a more input what other<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,490
you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the first</font>

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,320
scenario the<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical data is in the</font>

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,798
design your lots of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably are</font>

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,490
familiar with this is basically layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,970
all the way to topple racks which and

28
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:28,500
each type of racks which is this all l3

29
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:31,289
domain so all the address resolution are

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,619
down by the top of racks which because

31
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:39,119
of the numbered limited number of hosts

32
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:41,579
can be put into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's really no r</font>

33
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,729
& d issue or scaling issue at all and

34
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:49,110
this is if operators done<font color="#CCCCCC"> network this</font>

35
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:52,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">way everything is good and happy however</font>

36
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,979
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data center</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started moving into</font>

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:00,780
more rapid application multi tenants of

38
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:03,119
different type of applications and some

39
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,909
operators need to change the application

40
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,320
on particular physical servers from one

41
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,349
application to a different application

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,639
so with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of design</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically if</font>

43
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,709
you

44
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,929
on to change the load on particular

45
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,240
server to a different application on a

46
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,590
different subnet you have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,080
little trouble either you have to

48
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:25,370
reconfigure the switches with different

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,770
IP addresses or the you are constrained

53
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,350
starts and when you want to move some

54
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,989
virtual machine from one track to

55
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:45,040
another rack and you basically have to

56
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:48,500
reconfigure the IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,540
people operator<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with all those kind</font>

58
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,670
of three configurations everything is

59
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:59,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">fine so for the here come to the second</font>

60
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,910
scenario second scenario is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> elstree</font>

61
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,250
go all the way to aggregation switches

62
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,959
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also typical we've seen</font>

63
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,570
quite a few data centers with its kind

64
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:12,019
of design so this kind of design has a

65
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,970
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more flexibility basically if</font>

66
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,680
you move virtual machine from one track

67
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,380
to another rack you don't have to

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,310
reconfigure the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq switches or IP</font>

69
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,350
subnets and when you want to shift

70
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,209
change the workload on particular

71
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,859
physical server to a different

72
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,660
applications which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> supported by your</font>

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,959
neighboring rack you don't have to

74
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,780
reconfigure the IP addresses so that

75
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,400
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some level of flexibility</font>

76
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,060
however under this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of design used</font>

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,010
to I need to reconfigure switches the IP

78
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,280
addresses on the switches if you want to

79
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:51,310
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this group of recs to another</font>

80
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:55,610
couple racks so some operators choose to

81
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:58,220
implement a bigger l2 domain basically

82
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:02,299
having more number of racks to be under

83
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Sun they are two domain so that you</font>

84
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:06,530
can move<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual machine from one track</font>

85
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,530
to another rack with a bigger range of

86
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,260
number of wrecks and also that when you

87
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,260
move reload the servers with different

88
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,108
applications you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> more freedom where</font>

89
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,680
with application can put on two servers

90
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,440
on which rack so what triggers all those

91
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,560
needs

92
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,260
what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen is with lots of a</font>

93
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,510
newer data centers the demand go up and

94
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,830
down and this is especially true for

95
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:36,659
some data centers with Marty tenants and

96
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:40,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> men go up and down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they need to</font>

97
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,750
consolidate the usage into a smaller

98
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,610
number of racks when the demand is low

99
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,670
so that we can shut down some of the

100
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,820
rags and expanding to more racks when

101
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:55,380
the demand goes up and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

102
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:58,110
is applications in hosted by data center

103
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,680
some the demand can go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and down at</font>

104
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:04,170
different rates so take well<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

105
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,690
operators we work with they do lots of

106
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">online gaming and that's what they see a</font>

107
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,790
lot like some games being popular today

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,370
needing thousands of servers supporting

109
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,170
that game by tomorrow a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> game comes</font>

110
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,020
up and then all those server need to

111
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,400
shift from game to game be and they

112
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,320
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to physically move those</font>

113
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,450
servers from one rack to another rack

114
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,190
they want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to reconfigure the</font>

115
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,620
same server with different applications

116
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:32,190
and different applications may be on a

117
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,660
different subnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so that's why they</font>

118
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:38,040
need this so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pain points so</font>

119
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,860
pain point I just described it in

120
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,780
different traffic flow well when there's

121
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,530
external peers need to talk to host

122
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:48,690
inside the data center the routers

123
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:52,950
normally need to do is to hold those

124
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:56,250
data frames trigger the art on ND module

125
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:58,110
to send to look for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> target if they</font>

126
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,200
can now find the target after number of

127
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:04,860
tries they have to drop those data

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,590
frames so this process is not only CPU

129
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:12,300
intensive but it's also offer intensive

130
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:15,299
as well another type of traffic is from

131
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,520
internal host to external peers so when

132
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,410
internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> holes need to talk to external</font>

133
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,680
gears the first thing you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

134
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,750
to send an article and<font color="#E5E5E5"> D request to the</font>

135
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,530
default gateway to find the gateways MAC

136
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,930
addresses so this when you have large

137
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:33,510
number of hosts whether in one subnet or

138
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,920
one in multiple subnets when the number

139
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,170
of hosts increase

140
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,820
the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hits to the to the router</font>

141
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:43,440
get large and for ipv4 many vendors

142
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement a solution of having gateway</font>

143
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,110
to send out<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide to desorb so that</font>

144
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,650
mitigate lots of reduce the number of

145
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:55,100
requests from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway</font>

146
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:57,510
however for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6 hosts need</font>

147
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,630
bi-directional communication before they

148
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:03,270
can send any data packet to a different

149
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,780
subnet therefore even if they receive

150
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:08,340
the unsolicited neighbor discovery

151
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">request from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gaming router they</font>

152
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,440
still need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a unicast indeed</font>

153
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,810
request to the gateway router so that's

154
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">two has lots of number of requests to be</font>

155
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:22,560
processed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gaming router so the</font>

156
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">search scenario is when you have two</font>

157
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,140
distinct subnets under the l2 l3 gateway

158
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,960
so this one has combined a problem of

159
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:35,039
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> two scenario we just mentioned</font>

160
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,280
so basically from the subnet originating

161
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,130
subnet they need to send up an NT

162
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,440
requests and for the destination target

163
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,740
subnet the gateway router has to

164
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,200
initiate our<font color="#CCCCCC"> pawlenty requests to the</font>

165
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,570
target so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU intensive</font>

166
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:57,690
offer intensive so that's twice amount

167
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:59,640
of work and this one is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlay</font>

168
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:03,570
and recently we have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

169
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:06,120
overlay dress coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to IETF and overlay</font>

170
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:09,150
can be trail based can be matching

171
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">mac-based can be any of the three draft</font>

172
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,620
listed here it's all about overlay the

173
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,510
differences is where you do the overlay

174
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,730
right sometimes you do overlay on top of

175
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,159
rack switches sometimes you do overlay

176
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,800
on the hypervisor but whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

177
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,170
overlay or not the hosts in the data

178
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,020
center need to communicate with external

179
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:30,150
peers and some were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data center</font>

180
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,640
there need to be a place which resolve

181
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,069
all those addresses so the overlay and

182
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,750
address resolution become it's not

183
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,170
really overly doesn't solve the address

184
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:43,169
resolution issues and you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

185
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,640
bottleneck in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gateway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

186
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,979
peers communication with external

external one subnet to another

188
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:54,360
subnet so here just presenting those

189
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:58,079
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> progress and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want your</font>

190
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,199

you foresee in your network we're

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,160
the problem statement in IETF if you can

196
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,769
provide wording or any<font color="#CCCCCC"> text</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be</font>
