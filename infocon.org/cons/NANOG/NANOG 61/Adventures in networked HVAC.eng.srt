00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,110
good morning my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Ralph mule</font>

2
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:17,030
best known<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Wayback Machine where</font>

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:20,380
we store 400 billion web objects going

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,790
back all the way to 1996 but we're also

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,369
archiving a lot of other content for

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:29,119
instance via digitizing about 1,500

7
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:32,540
books in 35 scan centres and four

8
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,880
continents so 1,500 books per day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,730
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making them available either for</font>

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,770
borrowing or for all tried downloading

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,599
we are also did one of the newest big

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,540
collections is the television collection

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,970
we've been recording for about 12 years

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,890
we were recording when 911 happened and

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,250
we have those but we've expanded it

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,740
lately and the ideas to make television

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:56,420
searchable and quotable and a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,460
back we came across this building and

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,970
thought ha this looks exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> like our</font>

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,210
logo its fate we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to have it so my</font>

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:08,990
task was to turn this church from 1923

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:11,780
into a modern data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and office and</font>

23
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:15,589
we did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't quite easy and then</font>

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,640
one day<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a giant party we had a it</font>

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,770
was in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two-day</font>

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">conference we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 500 people in</font>

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,420
the house<font color="#E5E5E5"> Donald Knuth computer science</font>

28
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,899
pioneer was so kind to play the organ

29
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:29,450
for us and then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden it's</font>

30
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:33,319
dark the organ doesn't play the lights

31
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:37,009
out powers lost the data sent us down

32
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:38,749
the website is down and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">saved the evening by running extension</font>

34
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:45,759
cords from the neighboring building and

35
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:49,039
just powering<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 projector and laptop</font>

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,420
that led to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some head scratching and</font>

37
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,789
this is what started<font color="#CCCCCC"> me on this whole</font>

38
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,249
adventure and looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into things so the</font>

39
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:58,310
ultimate cause of that outage was that

40
00:01:55,249 --> 00:02:00,708
the utility had not provided as much

41
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,170
power as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> building was built out for</font>

42
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:05,329
so we found 800 amps in the building

43
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,520
thought oh great will never exceed that

44
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:10,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it turned out in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> street to</font>

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,500
transform I'd only<font color="#E5E5E5"> three and on 20 amps</font>

46
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,620
and if you if you ever want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

47
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,020
scared electricians it was funny when

48
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,610
they put the breaker on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transform in</font>

49
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,439
the street and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a giant hook</font>

50
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,360
like you know it's all it's almost

51
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,000
comical like the kind of hook that you

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,140
pull somebody off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stage</font>

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,550
so we didn't see that coming they were

54
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:35,339
flying blind and we wanted we wanted we

55
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,890
needed to make some<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes this is the</font>

56
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,820
Austin Texas style solution to an

57
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:44,640
uninterruptible power supply might not

58
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,440
protect against all outages so we were

59
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,019
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> around what is available what</font>

60
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,020
you already have and how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get a</font>

61
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">little more situational awareness and</font>

62
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,750
the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't all that great so</font>

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,400
this is we had a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> model of</font>

64
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,250
power strip that we initially selected

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,150
for cheapness it wasn't exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheap</font>

66
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,490
but the thing that really bit us a few

67
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,170
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there was an embedded</font>

68
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:15,050
controller in it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can then talk</font>

69
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:18,329
to to get a power basically amperage

70
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,460
measurement in real time but when the

71
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:24,450
power fields or if you deploy a new rack

72
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,790
well it asks for DGP Lee's exactly once

73
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,780
while you're smart switch is still

74
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,370
booting so if you run a data center with

75
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,860
thumb switches this is the power strip

76
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,510
for you and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a power strip</font>

77
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,460
used like you know else when the world

78
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,399
for 240 volt is specifically designed

79
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:45,620
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> North American data centers it's</font>

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,540
made for 208 volts it has a NEMA 5l 30

81
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,630
connector the only people buying this at

82
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,670
our data center once and I I have no

83
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,350
real explanation by this product exists

84
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,510
the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right there is a free</font>

85
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:01,079
stack of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation for the edge</font>

86
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">client thank you is see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> someday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

87
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,100
implemented the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HCP badly and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

88
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,859
this over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and over and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these embedded</font>

89
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,730
kind of things where people are either

90
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,500
not aware that there is an open source

91
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:17,219
implementation or it's very outdated and

92
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,890
very clunky another<font color="#CCCCCC"> example is an</font>

93
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,320
embedded fan controller luckily it spoke

94
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:26,099
SNMP but that was also<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

95
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,159
that spoke and you can use those and

96
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,560
script them together but it was I was

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,690
offended by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you need to write a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

98
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,190
to turn the fan on and a 1 to turn it

99
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,390
off

100
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:40,460
yeah you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete freedom and how</font>

101
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,919
to design this SNMP stack and you do

102
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,909
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one not like how does this</font>

103
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,010
happen then they're smart meters that's

104
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,710
kind of like a solution that would work

105
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,690
right it is real time its network on a

106
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:57,049
wireless network on its own frequency

107
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,150
probably license it is likely to be

108
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,400
accurate<font color="#CCCCCC"> because somebody is certifying</font>

109
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,960
these things and the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

110
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,109
somebody else already installed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

111
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,090
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> already there but unfortunately you</font>

112
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,610
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock into it there is no there's</font>

113
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,979
no data port on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there's no api there</font>

114
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,590
is a website that where I live in San

115
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Francisco it works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my home but</font>

116
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,119
as a commercial user the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

117
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,730
broken so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't even as screens we</font>

118
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,570
have the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found out later that</font>

119
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:30,410
all of these power me does have a

120
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:32,719
infrared LED that blings for every unit

121
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,640
of energy consumed what that unit is

122
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,010
seems to vary but you know think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

123
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,270
like a kilo but our planes occasionally

124
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,270
of course you would never know because

125
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,070
it's infrared and there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you</font>

126
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,919
can clamp on on top of it that will

127
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:48,980
count those so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a lost</font>

128
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,900
opportunity in a sense right this this

129
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,169
data is there it would be great<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font>

130
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:59,359
all had access to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an asst</font>

131
00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:02,030
cryptical so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of movement</font>

132
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,350
happening now with embedded boards right

133
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,390
a lot of the stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking</font>

134
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">about today would have been possible ten</font>

135
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,770
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago but there's some fundamental</font>

136
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,580
change is now happening there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

new embedded<font color="#E5E5E5"> bots available most notably</font>

138
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Arduino Yoon that is a young with</font>

139
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,150
that they'd have a built-in ethernet

140

very slick but also often proprietary

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,440
islands that it is hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to integrate</font>

147
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,510
with so you you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole variety of</font>

148
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,880
choices they are and the choices rain

149
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,780
for range from you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> solder you can</font>

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,690
sort our solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

152
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,860
crime against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud if it's open</font>

153
00:06:52,190 --> 00:07:00,469
enough it also ranges from<font color="#CCCCCC"> openness to</font>

154
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:02,630
closeness very much but there's what has

155
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,460
changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just the availability of so</font>

156
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,870
many options now it's kind of a new

157
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,450
revolution with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of momentum</font>

158
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,520
happening that gives us new options and

159
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,650
you can pick and choose kind of what

160
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,560
you're comfortable with low and<font color="#E5E5E5"> high end</font>

161
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">slake not slick there's a variety and</font>

162
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,550
for me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change was like oh this is</font>

163
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't feel like a grind anymore this</font>

164
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:25,210
is actually becoming fun so my first

165
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,740
adventure was like I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

166
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">real time power meter for the entire</font>

167
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,600
data center that I could rely on I

168
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,580
didn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred percent accuracy</font>

169
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,400
but it needed to be roughly in the same

170
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,909
ballpark and also important I didn't

171
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kill myself and I you have to be</font>

172
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,680
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful doing that I initially</font>

173
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought Oh since we we were upgrading</font>

174
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,490
the power utility was upgrading the

175
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,010
transformer in the street that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

176
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,630
a great opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get India in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

177
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,710
end it turned out I did it after they

178
00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:00,080
installed the new lines so that can

179
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:03,049
actually be safely done this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

180
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,289
is there is a ferret core think of it

181
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,780
like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a magnet that you can</font>

182
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:11,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">thatís can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be open so you can slip it</font>

183
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,909
around an existing power line you need

184
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:16,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to grab each face separately because</font>

185
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:19,729
otherwise the magnetic field cancels

186
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:23,330
each other out the way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> works is by</font>

187
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:26,330
induction so a small current is induced

188
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is proportional</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the real current</font>

189
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,430
going through the court and I kind of

190
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,469
fend off on the deep end they are a

191
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,650
little because I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that</font>

192
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:38,330
current is proportional so I just put a

193
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,689
burden resistor on and I can measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

194
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,820
then I realized oh it's AC so I need to

195
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,800
rectify it so I build a rectifier out of

196
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,350
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for capacitors and for our</font>

197
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,640
resistors and then I realized oh I need

198
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,850
I need to calculate a root-mean-square

199
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,680
to make this meaningful and then I

200
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,720
realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my sensor have already had</font>

201
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,030
that built in so I didn't have to do the

202
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,250
math I fool a all the rectifier stuff

203
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,620
and basically just took these<font color="#E5E5E5"> wires and</font>

204
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,230
plucked

205
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,350
right in and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just needed to do a</font>

206
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,600
little calibration to figure that out

207
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:14,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">but the math word for that was very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

208
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,529
easy this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what this looks like this</font>

209
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,079
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power lines coming in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I clamp run</font>

210
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:20,730
around all three phases and not the

211
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,770
ground and then I put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

212
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:26,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">nice-looking box we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to have a</font>

213
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:31,410
surplus of external hard drives after

214
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:33,029
the flood in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thailand and this is what</font>

215
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,339
the first graphs kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like you</font>

216
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:38,850
can kind of see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ups and downs for</font>

217
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:41,190
day and night by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

218
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,710
wondering why is one face off well this

219
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,779
is what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called split face in North</font>

220
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">America if you never heard of that when</font>

221
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:51,029
if you're from Europe or Asia be glad

222
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,890
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a kind of weird system it</font>

223
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:54,960
basically means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any normal consumer</font>

224
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,910
like laptops and light bulbs or so on

225
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,839
the yellow and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blue face and not on</font>

226
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:02,730
a green face so I anticipated<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

227
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,400
electricity goes up and down in the

228
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,470
building as humans walk in I didn't

229
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it was quite so much so this is</font>

230
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,200
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> five kilowatts or so and on the</font>

231
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,329
bottom on the green line you can kind of

232
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">see two computers this is the kind of</font>

233
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,930
MapReduce style computation where a task

234
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:24,300
gets deployed and on many machines in a

235
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,890
cluster they compute and finish at

236
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,949
different times and then combine<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

237
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:32,250
whole thing I was vaguely aware of these

238
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:34,230
I was surprised by the energy impact I

239
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,360
didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this was kind of</font>

240
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,670
like a ha here's here's something

241
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,279
interesting to see and there's

242
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,689
opportunities they are if you move the

243
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,240
task at night you have two advantages

244
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,870
it's cooler at night especially for us

245
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,400
not using<font color="#CCCCCC"> air conditioning and if you</font>

246
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:54,959
are a certain size for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data center</font>

247
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:58,410
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is advantageous to get a pricing plan</font>

248
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:02,369
that takes the time of day into account

249
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,529
so there's an opportunity there to move

250
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:09,900
the compute task to run at night<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

251
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:11,280
electricity is cheaper I started with

252
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,680
that and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought what else can I</font>

253
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,870
do so a lot of sensors are commercially

254
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,439
available temperature

255
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:21,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">moisture some of the smaller and meet us</font>

256
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,000
that you can clamp around there's also

257
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:25,229
power strips that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can query directly</font>

258
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,360
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was missing was the</font>

259
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,980
kind of air flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> meter I first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

260
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,660
little propeller that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always fall</font>

261
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,699
off then I used a piece of paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

262
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,829
works really well it indicates in which

263
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:36,839
direction the ears flowing very feel

264
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:40,229
safe very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheap but you can see it</font>

265
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,500
remotely and then I looked around what's

266
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,509
available and many sensors are built for

267
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,430
industrial users like if you have like

268
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:50,339
your chemical plant or your uranium

269
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,750
enrichment<font color="#E5E5E5"> plants these sensors are</font>

270
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,730
extremely expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and extremely</font>

271
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,639
accurate and what I needed to know was

272
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,790
basically is the air flowing or not and

273
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,420
in which direction maybe and see if

274
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,579
there's a trend over time Sadie if if

275
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air flow gradually gets lower of the</font>

276
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:10,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">course of a month maybe my filters need</font>

277
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:14,009
to be replaced so i found a relatively

278
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,719
cheap sensor bought it on ebay put in a

279
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,730
burden resistant and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could measure it</font>

280
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,180
and that's kind of a principle you can

281
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,329
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> if if you find any sense or out</font>

282
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,219
there usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you need to do is get</font>

283
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:28,349
it into the range what your sensor hub

284
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:33,839
can take as an input and then do a

285
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:37,319
little calibration this is chiseled in

286
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,350
the lobby of the humboldt university in

287
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:42,120
berlin so so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've done only</font>

288
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,000
measurements and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought okay i</font>

289
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to i want to actually do something</font>

290
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,660
namely turning fans on and off and the

291
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:54,839
idea would be run defense only<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font>

292
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:59,339
need / build<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in case some of them</font>

293
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:01,800
fail and change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very</font>

294
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,779
scary step so my recommendation is first

295
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,430
get started with measuring things and

296
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,290
then maybe turn a light bulb on to

297
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,649
simulate how you would turn on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fan and</font>

298
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,410
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> get comfortable with it another</font>

299
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:15,990
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> step is to not disenfranchised</font>

300
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,969
staff that is already<font color="#E5E5E5"> there no matter</font>

301
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,050
how good your sensor network is and you

302
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,120
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how good your situational awareness</font>

303
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,790
is you will never beat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> human who is</font>

304
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,740
in the building at the time so for a lot

305
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we put manual overrides</font>

306
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,230
in so they can force fans

307
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,069
off and then return it to normal

308
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:36,589
operation as a side note it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

309
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,810
tricky to communicate that with an

310
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:40,880
electrician to do the wiring for exactly

311
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:44,089
this this is just you know there's three

312
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,959
states on each switch and what finally

313
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:50,089
worked after drawing many diagrams was

314
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,859
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh just forget that I named</font>

315
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:53,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I'd better mention to read relay</font>

316
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,550
just just put another light switch over

317
00:13:53,779 --> 00:14:02,329
there and that's then the wires<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tapped</font>

318
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:05,630
into this is this is a clickable

319
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:08,469
interface and what you can see there's

320
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:11,990
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> two rules that basically are</font>

321
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:15,380
combined together on or fashion so if

322
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:19,190
the amperage of another fan is less than

323
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">7 amps assume the fan has failed or if</font>

324
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,320
the temperatures over a certain

325
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:26,390
threshold turn another fan on and you

326
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,430
could always do this before with what is

327
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,620
called a transfer switch you might be

328
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:33,020
familiar with them for data centers when

329
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,240
the power fields the UPS takes over and

330
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,470
then starts a generator well that's the

331
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,510
transfer switch they are an amazing

332
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:42,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">piece of technology but they're also</font>

333
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,939
expensive and difficult to deploy and

334
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,399
then if you want to do things like this

335
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">combined a transfer switch with a</font>

336
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,920
thermostat essentially it becomes very

337
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,510
tricky and it is tricky on a technical

338
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,360
level but it is also tricky on a

339
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,370
cultural level you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

340
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,740
your electricians and your HVAC people

341
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,930
to talk to each other and I kind of have

342
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,420
the same vision about how this should

343
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:12,170
work and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found this to be very</font>

344
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:13,819
difficult it in my experience it was

345
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:18,860
easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to electricians with</font>

346
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,240
atrial there seemed to be a we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

347
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,820
dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with several companies there seems</font>

348
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,410
to be a cultural lack of willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hack</font>

349
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:29,750
or improvise so we we were told you can

350
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,510
only heat a building or cooler building

351
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:35,209
but you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just run the fan and we</font>

352
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,740
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up of like a car analogy obviously</font>

353
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,719
is like well in my car I can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn a</font>

354
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,980
fan on I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the AC on</font>

355
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,240
every rattled no no you cannot do

356
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:48,389
to a building it does not work in the

357
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,519
end we just found a way to turn furnaces

358
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:56,430
on and off and keep the fans running

359
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:59,190
independently so once you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch</font>

360
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:02,010
of sensors now you can correlate events

361
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,410
together in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case what you see on</font>

362
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,019
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top is the temperature graphs in</font>

363
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,000
Fahrenheit so it was getting hot in the

364
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:11,160
middle you see which fans<font color="#CCCCCC"> went on and</font>

365
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">off so that's like a 1 and 0 and then on</font>

366
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,839
the bottom there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> air flow now the</font>

367
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">air flow looks a little different</font>

368
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:19,949
inversed here because the there's a

369
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,019
natural air flow and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then many fans kick</font>

370
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:25,410
in it actually blows them in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

371
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:27,240
direction but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see both in</font>

372
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">real time and later when you try to</font>

373
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,220
reconstruct what happened is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

374
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:35,399
it rose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain level then the fan</font>

375
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:41,000
kicked in and then things happened it

376
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:43,589
got cooler and so forth so the

377
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,790
interesting thing is you get more

378
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:50,610
confidence in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system how it works as</font>

379
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more data inputs right so you</font>

380
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,810
can measure current you can measure

381
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">airflow you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can measure temperature and</font>

382
00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:01,170
the picture gets more consistent you'll

383
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:05,730
always we try to anticipate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

384
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:07,409
outage and find come up with rules that

385
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,179
anticipate how that outage might look

386
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,339
like but you might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch</font>

387
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:13,949
them all but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least you can go back in</font>

388
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:19,770
time and and reconstruct what had

389
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:21,990
happened before this is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

390
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,520
existing alarm system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we found in</font>

391
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,319
one of the buildings that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we bought and</font>

392
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,079
I opened it and thought oh my god it's

393
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,720
the 1980s so I closed it up immediately

394
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,970
went home slept over and went back the

395
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,650
next day so what you see there is a

396
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:42,090
dozens and dozens of sensors ranging

397
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:44,549
from from door sensors to motion sensors

398
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,010
to light beams and other things and this

399
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:49,230
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it together in a certain way they</font>

400
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:52,500
are not not all these sensors are the

401
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,659
same and the logic is kind of encoded in

402
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,119
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's wired so for instance if</font>

403
00:17:54,659 --> 00:18:00,210
the alarm is on and the door gets opened

404
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:03,029
that is a fault the sirens go off the

405
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">security company gets called if a single</font>

406
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:08,970
motion sensor on the inside is tripped

407
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,899
the assumption is it's the cat so no

408
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,489
alarm is triggered but if to our tripped

409
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:17,039
the assumption is oh there's a break in

410
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:19,379
right if you upgrade your warehouse<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

411
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:23,669
one cat two cats you now have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be why</font>

412
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:26,488
others would be easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in software</font>

413
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:30,659
but I felt a little daunted<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

414
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:33,419
prospect of doing all of that so in the

415
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:35,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">end I decided well there is a siren let</font>

416
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,919
me just tap into the siren so when a

417
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:40,499
siren comes on that's a 24 volt signal I

418
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,840
measured it and then I can translate

419
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:45,690
that so if the siren goes off in one way

420
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,668
a house I get an email but I can also

421
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:50,070
like trigger a siren in a different

422
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,690
building so you have one thing and then

423
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,168
you trigger something in a remote thing

424
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:57,299
and you know all of this been possible

425
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:59,279
obviously the security companies get

426
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,629
remote alerts but now it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

427
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:07,019
sensor and you send it over an existing

428
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:08,728
Wi-Fi network so what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get out of</font>

429
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,519
that well we have situational awareness

430
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:14,479
over our data center from remote and

431
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,879
weekends when nobody needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be there</font>

432
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:20,190
we get we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> combine the inputs from</font>

433
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:23,668
from a variety of sensors that are very

434
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:26,279
different and the way these sensors

435
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:29,820
inform the system is now all in software

436
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:33,720
so it is a rules-based with a clickable

437
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,460
interface we did not disenfranchised<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

438
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,259
local people they can still override

439
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,999
everything this has been proven very

440
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,950
helpful like they need to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance</font>

441
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:44,669
they just turn it<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or they just see</font>

442
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,499
it is too hot because something changed

443
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:50,399
something was unanticipated so they can

444
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:53,159
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a an unexpected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> benefit was</font>

445
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,830
we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance the power better</font>

446
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,989
across different phases beforehand is

447
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,389
what guess work by our electricians like

448
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:02,849
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah this outlet has these two</font>

449
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:05,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">phases in it and so forth and now we</font>

450
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:08,480
know exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok this is the lowest face</font>

451
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,970
so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> drag will be on that face</font>

452
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,390
that has allowed us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay way below</font>

453
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:17,660
the line via breaker trips the end

454
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,790
result is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

457
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:26,270
everywhere Allah data centers are in the

weeks when the when San Francisco

463
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,989
actually has warm weather then it

464
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,290
becomes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little tricky and the way we</font>

465
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:47,960
solved it mostly is by blowing more air

466
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:50,928
and faster right air flow has a certain

467
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,540
capacity for thermal to take on and the

468
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:55,190
faster you blow the air the more you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

469
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,730
do it so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not a hundred</font>

470
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:02,210
percent win but it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> work in our</font>

headquarters in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> former</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Church we are</font>

472
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,340
also having a big office and we are

473
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,909
using the excess heat from the data

474
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,290
center to heat the building so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think</font>

475
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,750
we're industry-leading with that with a

476
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">pua of less than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one but it is also not</font>

477
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,890
a complete success story it turns out

478
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,559
that on a regular furnace you heat the

479
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,840
air a lot so you can move it around if

480
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:27,250
your ear is moderately hot and by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

481
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:31,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean 110 120 for a night on the hot side</font>

482
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:33,710
it the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of energy you need to move</font>

483
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,129
that moderately hot air around is very

484
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,929
high so we reach a state where it

485
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,250
sometimes it's just easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a</font>

486
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:42,799
space heater in place instead of

487
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:46,940
spending more energy just force

488
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:49,668
moderately hot air round and the number

489
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,799
that we are the proudest of is that we

490
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:54,200
know how much energy it costs us to a

491
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:57,020
petabyte so currently that is 3.3

492
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,850
kilowatts per petabyte<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying to</font>

493
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,910
start a meme here so please ask your

494
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,469
storage vendors what that number is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

495
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,799
just want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

496
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:09,530
that it would be possible to save even

497
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,450
more one of the challenges<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that</font>

498
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,940
every server comes of tiny power

499
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,630
supplies that have this tiny whining

500
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,090
fans and

501
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,490
if they had bigger power supplies with

502
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:26,310
bigger fans we that we could push that

503
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:28,950
number down even further so it's a it's

504
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:31,200
a kind of new world things are easier

505
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,890
cheaper and funner than they were before

506
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,520
the the big brake fluids that software

507
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:40,290
is replacing hardware or at least making

508
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,740
simpler hardware and combining them in a

509
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,850
more flexible way than it was before and

510
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,010
there is a potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of</font>

511
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:50,219
savings through what i call layer

512
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:51,900
violations right so normally you figure

513
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,400
out what your peak usage as you tell

514
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,930
your electricians and it build it out

515
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,880
for the peak usage and you tell your a

516
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,500
trick people also what the peak is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

517
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,480
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know everybody adds twenty percent</font>

518
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,620
and so you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the data center</font>

519
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,030

520
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:11,070
to anticipate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> peak and if you at</font>

521
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">least inform these different layers with</font>

522
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,870
each other you can do things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like move</font>

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:20,640
compute drops to run at<font color="#CCCCCC"> night and</font>

524
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:23,340
increase efficiency<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that way so</font>

lastly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to make a small pitch we</font>
