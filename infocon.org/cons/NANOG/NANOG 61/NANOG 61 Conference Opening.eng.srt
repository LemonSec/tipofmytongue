229
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,570
ultra-cool Devo exhibits but I did read

235
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,270
things seem a bit bogged down I'm sure

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,250
you were used to ultra high levels of

237
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,980
capacity in your former life but now

238
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,420
that you are in a bit less ostentatious

239
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,060
circumstances at one summer I thought

240
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,819
everyone including you would be served

241
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,459
very adequately on 100 gig e connections

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:47,670
farther away in Amsterdam well I guess

245
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,670
it will be adequate

246
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:09,160
