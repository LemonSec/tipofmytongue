37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,270
important to see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work that we</font>

to guide book it's pretty good

43
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,080
acceptance rate which was also leading I

44
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,200
think I

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:32,250
up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation survey responses</font>

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,109
we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> says Greg said remind you to</font>

take the survey please remind you to

48
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,780
take the survey it tells us it gives us

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,869
guidance in terms of whether you like

50
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,240
presentations or not and in addition to

51
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the general survey we tried to make it</font>

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier for you to take the survey I</font>

53
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,470
believe maybe that was the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

54
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell me what</font>

greatly appreciated a reminder<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

general survey which is trailing a

67
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,750
we've worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard to keep your</font>

68
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,780
registration fees down I believe it's

69
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,610
six near six years now Patrick that we

70
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,700
haven't increased the registration fee

71
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,700
and in large part we can do that because

72
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,200
of the commitment of vendors to help pay

73
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,390
for the infrastructure all the other

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:56,670
costs that it takes to run nanog in

75
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:58,910
