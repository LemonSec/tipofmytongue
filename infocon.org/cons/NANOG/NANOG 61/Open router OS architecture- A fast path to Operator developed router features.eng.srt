00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">sup we have Brian field from comcast one</font>

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,940
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things about having a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 9</font>

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,740
person meeting is there actually is

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,700
another there's actually a Brian fields

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:21,009
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> here fields plural I don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">he is he's a close by but this is brian</font>

7
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:25,000
field it's one field singular field from

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,029
comcast he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,460
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equally cool this is</font>

10
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:34,180
basically compiling your own routing

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:37,480
demon on a you know major routing

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:40,000
platform so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go great thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm</font>

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my name is Brian feel I'm</font>

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,219
with comcast and see how do we get this

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:49,329
thing to work there we go there we go

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,829
you know not to talk to you some stuff

17
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're doing at comcast I'm thinking</font>

18
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,489
I was happy to see the gentleman before

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,390
me show you somewhere shark<font color="#CCCCCC"> traces</font>

20
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,190
because i'm going to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some stuff</font>

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,930
as well what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about today</font>

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,059
is not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> powerpoint stuff it's stuff</font>

23
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're actually building and you</font>

24
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:06,820
know the title of the talk is the hybrid

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">open router architecture and you know</font>

26
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,300
the general idea is that we're looking

27
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">at you know we've got all this hype</font>

28
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,060
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with sdn and sdn means</font>

29
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,030
different things to different people

30
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,679
right for some people means automating

31
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,080
configuration on the router for other

32
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:22,000
people it means programming<font color="#CCCCCC"> tem stayed</font>

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,250
in to the router you know for other

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,420
people it means you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know virtualization</font>

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,830
and service cheating and whatnot and

36
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,750
those are all really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good and</font>

37
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">important things and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

38
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,590
kind of think about sdn is kind of like

39
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,000
you've got this routing infrastructure

40
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,709
and then you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this layer of</font>

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,050
controllers that sits on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

42
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:40,179
it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if much of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the SDN</font>

43
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,550
innovation stuff is happening at the

44
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:45,220
controller layer or above it and that's

45
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,780
good that's necessary that's needed but

46
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think it's only half of the problem</font>

47
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,670
and it may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the important half of</font>

48
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:54,160
where we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do SDM and so in the</font>

49
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,959
talk today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to talk about sdn</font>

50
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,640
kind of happening below the controller

51
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,860
level right how we can do innovation

52
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,450
happening within a router platform

53
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:06,160
itself and you know so do some of the

54
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,959
existing you know so the thinking here

55
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,579
is that suppose you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a new feature</font>

56
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the router you need that new feature</font>

57
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,970
today how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that what's the</font>

58
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,040
normal process we go through well we go

59
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to our friends in the bay we plead to</font>

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,340
them to say can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you please add this</font>

61
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,529
feature to your platform and it gets put

62
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,180
into the roadmap in six months later or

63
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,410
12 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> later something pops out and</font>

64
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,670
then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to your other</font>

65
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,200
vendors and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get all</font>

66
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,059
this stuff to work what if you really

67
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,679
really need a router feature today right

68
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,410
for your business whatever it is how do

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do that do the existing SD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sdn</font>

70
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,040
paradigms help here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

71
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">they do and i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick on open</font>

72
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,760
flow and I kind of think of open flow is

73
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,040
kind of being kind of like a marionette

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,720
sort of puppet right so I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

75
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,920
fingers and I've got the strings down to

76
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,109
the puppet which is you know the

77
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,208
<font color="#CCCCCC">openflow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API and what not and if I want</font>

78
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make that puppet kick the only way I</font>

79
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:52,540
can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if I have a string</font>

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,280
attached to its knee and its foot right

81
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,380
now if I don't have those primitives I

82
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,580
can't make it do what I wanted to do and

83
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,950
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's kind of where we are with</font>

84
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,590
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN today if I need a new feature on</font>

85
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">a router chances are the stn mechanisms</font>

86
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,500
don't support what I need them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all</font>

87
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,329
right so I need to look at another way

88
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,610
to do that and so I'm going to propose a

89
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:17,230
new form of SDN which is called

90
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:22,470
something I can do now that's not what

91
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:24,579
was expecting this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the wrong talk I</font>

92
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:32,160
guess I didn't get the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> dice up on</font>

93
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:36,340
Friday all right this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong talk</font>

94
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,799
all right let's go back we'll go through

95
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,590
it anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so this is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:47,350
i'll just go wing it with it here<font color="#CCCCCC"> mhm</font>

97
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:48,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so last in new orleans last year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

98
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,440
got up<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and proposed something</font>

99
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,290
called about applying web principles to

100
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,060
the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

101
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,980
suggesting is the web geyser really

102
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,650
really have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been really innovative and</font>

103
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,078
whatnot and a big part of the reason

104
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,480
they've been innovative is because their

105
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,700
entire web stack is open HTTP running on

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,959
top of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache running on top of</font>

107
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,760
Linux running on top of common

108
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,440
off-the-shelf hardware and I was making

109
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,160
a pitch we need to do the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing in</font>

110
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,870
the routing space<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and you know so I</font>

111
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,519
was proposing a year ago you know we

112
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to get to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open source sort of</font>

113
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,410
paradigm for routing and we have this

114
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">huge gap of what we have today legacy</font>

115
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,190
router wise and where we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

116
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,039
right so we've got you know these these

117
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:33,070
lockdown sort of you know boxes and what

118
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:35,110
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is somehow basically you</font>

119
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,409
know enable us to basically put our own

120
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,150
software on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> box</font>

121
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,469
and we have this gap between what we

122
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,719
have today and where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

123
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,289
and this is really difficult having the

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,970
wrong slides I'll tell you that so we

125
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,680
have this gap between kind of the legacy

126
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">paradigm of what we have today and where</font>

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,520
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to and so the thinking is</font>

128
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,840
is at you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we bridge this gap</font>

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,878
from this legacy paradigm where

130
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,500
everything is locked down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and an open</font>

131
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,150
platform where we have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

132
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,520
add our own things into it and so the

133
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,739
thinking is wouldnt it be really really

134
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,990
great if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was this router platform</font>

135
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,150
that consisted of both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like vendor</font>

136
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,460
code but also had the ability for us to

137
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,289
drop in open source code or our own

138
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,930
develop code how long do we wouldn't

139
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,729
that be a useful paradigm to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

140
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,469
so the thinking is is that can I bridge

141
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,699
from this legacy domain to this open

142
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:22,530
source domain without going completely

143
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,539
gung-ho to the open source domain

144
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,580
basically leveraging this legacy

145
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,020
platform to do you know to add

146
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,719
incrementally the things that I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

147
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,818
do to it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what slides</font>

148
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:37,229
here have to flip this a little bit

149
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:38,879
kisses stn<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the thinking is</font>

150
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,940
is that wouldn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really really</font>

151
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,370
great if there was an existing platform

152
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,400
that basically ran vendor code on it but

153
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,659
also provided the ability for us to drop

154
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,130
her own code onto it and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't mean</font>

155
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:51,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through an sdk i mean basically</font>

156
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,810
writing your own code that basically

157
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,638
talks to the underlying OS directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

158
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,949
wouldn't that be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great if that</font>

159
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">was possible you know this is the</font>

160
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,190
unicorns rainbows if that was possible

161
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,020
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can basically leverage the</font>

162
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,610
existing vendor platform to do kind of

163
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,549
their existing stuff and when I need a

164
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,469
new feature I can add it myself right

165
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,560
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was kind of the thinking</font>

166
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:16,080
here and so it turns out hopefully this

167
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,849
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> slight expect thank you it turns</font>

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,650
out there is at least one vendor

169
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:22,229
platform out there that allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

170
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">this that allows you basically turn you</font>

171
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:26,568
can basically run their code and you can

172
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:28,979
supplement their code with your own code

173
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:30,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you no longer locked</font>

174
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,979
down to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of whatever the sets of</font>

175
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,900
features are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that existing platform</font>

176
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,960
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> add your own sorts of features</font>

177
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's a linux-based so basically if</font>

178
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,989
you can get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run on like a</font>

179
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,810
bunt or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that it will run</font>

180
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,789
on their box allows your drop in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

181
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,380
own code and binaries and whatnot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

182
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:47,820
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this platform we kind of that movie</font>

183
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool so we're thinking</font>

184
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,599
from a comcast perspective

185
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:53,009
would be an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> use case here</font>

186
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,589
what would be a new feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would</font>

187
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,029
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add to this platform that isn't</font>

188
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:59,639
available today or it isn't available<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

189
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:02,429
any platforms as far as I'm aware of and

190
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,129
that is segment routing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment</font>

191
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:07,469
routings relatively new technology

192
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:09,149
introducing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF in 2013 it's not</font>

193
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:11,549
supported on any platform that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm aware</font>

194
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:13,049
of today and from a segment rounding

195
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:15,508
perspective really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really high level</font>

196
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:17,998
what allows you to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically do</font>

197
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:19,739
traffic engineering in service chaining

198
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:22,009
so it's it's you know v6 extension

199
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:24,628
header that<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows you to kind of to</font>

200
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,519
describe how the package<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through</font>

201
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:28,049
the network and also indicates kind of

202
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,569
what applications it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> wear</font>

203
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:32,998
application endpoints that it can hit

204
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:34,619
and effectively do service shading and

205
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:35,879
again comcast is interested in segment

206
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:38,129
routing and we're specifically

207
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,739
interested in v6 segment routing so from

208
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:43,169
our perspective we have this platform or

209
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:44,818
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop your own code in and we want</font>

210
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:46,258
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do our own version or we want</font>

211
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:50,279
to basically see if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box</font>

212
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,719
do segment routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

213
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more details on what segment routing</font>

214
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:57,239
is the very high level there you've got

215
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:59,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">a v6 packet you know in v6 we have these</font>

216
00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:01,558
concepts of extension headers inside of

217
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,929
this segment<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing extension header</font>

218
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:06,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have these things called SIDS there</font>

219
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:08,938
/ 128 and they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify the</font>

220
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,409
set of endpoints this package<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

221
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,459
actually traverse through the network

222
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,779
there's a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff</font>

223
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,849
associated with the segment routing

224
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,949
header but the key here is that those

225
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:18,029
sequence of SIDS basically identify how

226
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:23,489
the package would flow through the

227
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:25,379
network will real high level how does

228
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:27,388
this operate basically what happens is

229
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,189
when a segment rounding package shows up

230
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,019
on the wire the<font color="#CCCCCC"> packet is routed via the</font>

231
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:33,659
normal destination address of the v6

232
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:35,698
packet when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets to the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point of</font>

233
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,468
that destination address the process

234
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:39,659
they're basically processes the data and

235
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:41,849
then when it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> done processing the data</font>

236
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,159
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically looks into the segment</font>

237
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,769
router header and says what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

238
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoint this package should go to so</font>

239
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:51,449
basically identifies that / 128 updates

240
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,059
the segment routing header and then it

241
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:55,889
basically takes that next / 128 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

242
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:57,839
makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a destination address to the v6</font>

243
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,339
packet and then it forwards a package so

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,569
kind of you can kind of understand how

245
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,980
it allows you to kind of do traffic

246
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:03,900
steering through the network and again

247
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,710
that / 128 that's the destination

248
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,480
dress can be an application now you know

249
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">again the segment routing is not</font>

250
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,410
something completely news introduced in

251
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,770
ITF last year and I believe in the June

252
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,630
nanog as well it was a it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented</font>

253
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:23,040
as well so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not completely you</font>

254
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:24,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">know new technology so now I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

255
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,550
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about what we did here</font>

256
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,790
again we wanted to do segment routing

257
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,550
and you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a box where you can</font>

258
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,569
basically drop on your own code and so

259
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,979
the first thing you kind of need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

260
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,230
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of in a classic</font>

261
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,360
router control plant operation and so

262
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,590
you know you all use BGP and ospf is an

263
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,540
instance but basically you know those

264
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,610
are just processes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> user space that</font>

265
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,219
basically bind to an IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and to a</font>

266
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,620
protocol and traffic coming into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

267
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,270
box for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular IP address or</font>

268
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,220
protocol goes the you know through the

269
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,840
a6 it goes through a hardware filter

270
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,490
called cop or something like that where

271
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,800
you basically limit what actually gets

272
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,300
punted up to the OS level and then the

273
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,550
application actually receives those

274
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,189
packets ISM and processes those right

275
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,620
this is how BGP works this is our ospf

276
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,150
works we need to get segments routing to

277
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:15,180
do the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so this is</font>

278
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:18,480
what we did we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined a new</font>

279
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,849
process built a new process based on go

280
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,160
and what it did was it just bound to the

281
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,770
loopback address on the box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it</font>

282
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,020
also bound to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol 43 so if you look</font>

283
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packet that's carrying the</font>

284
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,329
extension header the next protocol layer

285
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,949
is 43 so we basically wrote some classic

286
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,600
code that basically blind to the socket

287
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">binds to the IP address bonds to that</font>

288
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,000
protocol 43<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then basically we</font>

289
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,380
started generating packets or have

290
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,410
package that you know where the process

291
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,170
is bound to that to that IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

292
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,579
protocol waiting for packets to arrive

293
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,319
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is is that or in addition</font>

294
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that salute back address we force</font>

295
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,510
that / 128 to be an Isis into our IDP so

296
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,830
there's connectivity for it and then we

297
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to update cop we have to update</font>

298
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,940
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> control plane filter because now we</font>

299
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,500
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start receiving traffic not just</font>

300
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the loopback address but for that</font>

301
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,610
specific protocol by default it won't

302
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,260
get through<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have to tickle the cop</font>

303
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,480
configuration to allow this new type<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

304
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,090
traffic to get punted off of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asics</font>

305
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,080
up to the OS level and then basically

306
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,000
the code logic of this

307
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,620
this code that we were is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we wrote</font>

308
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,800
is relatively simple again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yours</font>

309
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,510
binding to a / 128 to an IP address

310
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,870
protocol 43 and then you just sit there

311
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,340
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an Apache so hdb demon would</font>

312
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,510
sit listening for incoming connections

313
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,820
the same sort of thing it's waiting for

314
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">incoming packets so with that IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

315
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,170
in that protocol when a packet comes in

316
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,520
we know that it's an SR a segment

317
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,290
reading packet because it's already got

318
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,180
you know it's coming in on protocol 43

319
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,030
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we basically process the header</font>

320
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">which basically means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at you</font>

321
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,920
know the index into the segment routing

322
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,689
header what's the next / 128<font color="#E5E5E5"> the package</font>

323
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,430
should be addressed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rewriting the</font>

324
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,830
destination address and then forwarding

325
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,920
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we wrote this code we wrote</font>

326
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and go we built we compiled it build</font>

327
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,400
static image dropped it onto the box we

328
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:09,340
tweaked cop and it worked so what we

329
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,620
just did is we took an existing router

330
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,130
platform and added a feature to it

331
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,840
without the vendor being involved at all

332
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,730
and we did that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's an open OS</font>

333
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,320
architecture just vanilla Linux

334
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:26,110
underneath and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide you access</font>

335
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:28,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them okay and I mentioned you know</font>

336
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">some Wireshark stuff and glad to see</font>

337
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,189
that's in this presentation here so this

338
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:35,650
is a the SR packets that are on the wire

339
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,530
we wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> you not only code to basically</font>

340
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,930
process sr packets but we also wrote

341
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,640
code to kind of you know to to do the

342
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,319
decodes and Wireshark or not so it's a

343
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,540
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an eye chart but you can actually</font>

344
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,190
see you know a blowout of you know the

345
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,050
details<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a segment router header you</font>

346
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see the highlighted in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> section in</font>

347
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,300
blue blue which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the actual</font>

348
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,560
payload extension header payload that's

349
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,650
carrying all the segments rounding stuff

350
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,810
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> individual / 128 to there so we</font>

351
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,130
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> got this up and running let's</font>

352
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,829
see what my next slide was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

353
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,300
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take a step back it's</font>

354
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,520
our view it's not going to be on the

355
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">powerpoint it's going to be me so we</font>

356
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,630
built the ability to basically add a new

357
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,640
feature to a router without getting the

358
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,970
router vendor guys involved that's very

359
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,680
empowering right what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

360
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,350
we wanted to take the next step<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I</font>

361
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,760
spin up a process on a router that's

362
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,860
segment routing aware what I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

363
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,069
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not just announced that / 128</font>

364
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,590
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also like to announce that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

365
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,270
router

366
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,490
has the capability to do segment routing

367
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,500
so the thinking was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> router</font>

368
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,820
when that process spins up it binds the

369
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,010
port does all that magic stuff what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

370
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:43,520
would also like it to do is the tickle

371
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:45,590
Isis if you look at Isis it's got this

372
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,090
ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to administrative tags right</font>

373
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,460
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like BGP communities</font>

374
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,080
and what I wanted to do on this vet on

375
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">this vendors platform is when that</font>

376
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,640
segment routing process came up tickle

377
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,190
Isis to basically a now not just

378
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,130
announce this / 128 but to announce this

379
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:03,860
128 with a specific tag value the idea

380
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,750
being you can basically get your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

381
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">state northbound through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp link state</font>

382
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,890
to a controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> application see the</font>

383
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,170
controller should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to see the set</font>

384
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,670
of a blur set of routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

385
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">segment routing aware so that was kind</font>

386
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,540
of the thinking right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

387
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:21,080
wanted to do it turns out that this

388
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,959
vendors instance of Isis did not support

389
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,610
administrative tags so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

390
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">geez this would have been really really</font>

391
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,290
cool if we could get this to work what

392
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:33,550
are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do and so it was</font>

393
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:37,400
suggested well why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take quagga</font>

394
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:40,189
clog is open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source Isis why don't you</font>

395
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,340
just take quagga hack in a new tlv into

396
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,710
quagga and we're in quagga instead of

397
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,560
the vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> isis and said that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

398
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,810
did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically took quagga and again</font>

399
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,880
that's not on<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but we took quagga we</font>

400
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,250
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> added a new tlv to quagga</font>

401
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,600
which basically associate say tag value

402
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:01,340
to a / 128 and then we allow that that

403
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,100
that tagged out to get propagated around

404
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:06,230
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> isis and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically turned off the</font>

405
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,870
vendors instance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> isis and ran our own</font>

406
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,640
instance of Isis<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so think about</font>

407
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,710
that paradigm I was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

408
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">left-hand side you have this legacy</font>

409
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,210
router stack that's completely locked

410
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,830
down on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right hand side I was</font>

411
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,570
thinking we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this open source router</font>

412
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,550
stack right where everything is open and

413
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was how do I bridge the gap right</font>

414
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">from this completely locked down</font>

415
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,699
paradigm to this open paradigm and this

416
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,790
platform allows me to incremental e ad

417
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,440
features to their box<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when you</font>

418
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,910
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we did we easily the</font>

419
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,920
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we did was we added a new</font>

420
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,449
feature to their platform we added the

421
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,240
segment routing capability to their

422
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,680
platform the second thing we did was we

423
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,790
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their version of Isis</font>

424
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,180
didn't do what we need

425
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:51,170
to do so we turned it off we ran our own

426
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:53,630
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right very empowering very</font>

427
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">empowering okay so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does this all</font>

428
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:59,360
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mean yeah well maybe this is an</font>

429
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,520
alternative paradigm to sdn and again

430
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,740
when you think about it again you know

431
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,030
from my perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sdn tends to be you</font>

432
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,710
know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening at the controller</font>

433
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,600
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> and northbound</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

434
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications sitting above it you know</font>

435
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,130
we have you know the controller level

436
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,630
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> openstack and open flow kind of</font>

437
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,180
tickling southbound but there's not a

438
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,920
lot of ability to make changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

439
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,870
there most platforms and I think that's

440
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,329
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be key for us the ability to</font>

441
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,800
innovate on the router itself by adding

442
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,450
our own sorts of features and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot</font>

443
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,579
that's not supported today are not

444
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">really enabled by the current sdn</font>

445
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,250
paradigm as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell when you</font>

446
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,689
think about what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is we</font>

447
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,820
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vendor platform we've got</font>

448
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,480
existing vendor code and then we can add

449
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,070
the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source stuff thank you and so</font>

450
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,690
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't necessarily need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

451
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,790
completely going home to the open source

452
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,230
space right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can basically leverage the</font>

453
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,790
vendor to do the heavy lifting on the

454
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,500
protocols that are off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shelf and I</font>

455
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,870
know and love and I know that they work

456
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,000
fine and that only can or i can add in

457
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,710
just the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add in</font>

458
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,420
that are important to me again if I need

459
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,460
segment routing capability<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can add</font>

460
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,050
that in and part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

461
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,700
that when you go to a vendor and say

462
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,829
jeez I'd really like this capability if

463
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,720
you have a working piece of code that

464
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:10,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of demonstrates it it's not just</font>

465
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,170
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a power point right this is the</font>

466
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,369
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that I think in it if you</font>

467
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,410
actually have it up and running it's

468
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:16,669
more powerful right to convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

469
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,070
vendors that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually do</font>

470
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,600
this so you know what about you know

471
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,179
this hybrid sort of model it's a

472
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,500
combination of both vendor code and open

473
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,880
source code right and you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

474
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,230
pick and choose which pieces that you

475
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,370
actually want or need at any point in

476
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">time and then the thinking is is that</font>

477
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,489
you know all this new code that we're

478
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,920
adding maybe we do open source maybe we

479
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,660
all collectively as a community when we

480
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,310
need new features you know think about

481
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:47,750
building them together and going down

482
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:50,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open source sort of path ok ok rough</font>

483
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:54,200
consensus and working code tagline from

484
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:56,120
IETF right you know the paradigm that

485
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,350
we're pitching here the ability for each

486
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,199
of us

487
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,750
each of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put our own features on</font>

488
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,220
our boxes is very empowering and so

489
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,640
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might change the</font>

490
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">ietf what happens the ITF for the most</font>

491
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">part we're all you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know unaffiliated</font>

492
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,580
individuals when we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

493
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,289
IETF but if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually run code if</font>

494
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can actually basically build your</font>

495
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,740
own code and run them on the box that's

496
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,390
very empowering right so you know if

497
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,770
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not part of a router vendor but</font>

498
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,660
you can still let your own code and put

499
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,639
it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box and it empowers you in the</font>

500
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,950
IETF space i believe and so maybe we

501
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,370
need to rethink or maybe this changes

502
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:38,030
how things happen in the ITF space maybe

503
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:43,100
this is going to be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's see</font>

504
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:45,289
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so is it my final slide here</font>

505
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,158
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be just a quote with</font>

506
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:50,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">great power comes great responsibility</font>

507
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so think about what we're</font>

508
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing here all right we're kind of doing</font>

509
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,950
brain surgery on or routers right

510
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,559
individuals are going to be writing

511
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,179
their own code or the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

512
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,549
their own code and run them on the box

513
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:04,429
right so we're all adults here we

514
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:06,379
realize you know with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those risks come</font>

515
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:08,330
great rewards but you can also screw

516
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,309
things up as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so I realized you know</font>

517
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,918
we're basically you know there's some

518
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:14,780
risk to what we're proposing here but

519
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">again you know it's we're all adults and</font>

520
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,520
we can kind of figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what risks are</font>

521
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,850
worth taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so that's it thank</font>

522
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,850
you very much

523
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:30,190
p some microphones<font color="#CCCCCC"> are open for</font>

524
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions um what if anyone has question</font>

525
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,570
come up let me just apologize to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian</font>

526
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,789
for not having the right slides up we

527
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,379
never received them so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

528
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:39,460
have been an email bounced that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

529
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're going to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we fix</font>

530
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,479
that cuz we did have one other case

531
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:46,419
where somebody bounced somebody's slides

532
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:48,429
bounced but Brian I'll give you my

533
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,109
personal email and you can send the

534
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:51,549
slides there and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they get</font>

535
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:52,718
up on the website so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your final</font>

536
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:56,259
slides are actually the ones that are

537
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:59,889
posted perfect thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hi nick</font>

538
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:01,330
kochifos from amazon um two questions

539
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:05,049
are you going to tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you were</font>

540
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,249
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what do you mean the the</font>

541
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:09,789
hardware platform you were Oh

542
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:12,519
experimenting fun yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it begins with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

543
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:15,879
and ends in rishta very good thank you

544
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:18,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">and actually add to that so they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

545
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:21,009
incredibly supportive right and you know

546
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:22,809
what I want to make it clear is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

547
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:24,609
platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the right platform you know</font>

548
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:25,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense the architecture I think</font>

549
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:27,728
is the right platform i'm not a big

550
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,440
vendor or specific person but i think

551
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:30,999
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's the right platform i</font>

552
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,190
think we need for this sdn evolution

553
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:36,419
something good and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> on those</font>

554
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,499
lines on do you see much<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way of</font>

555
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,330
say just kind of generic hardware

556
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:44,109
vendors throwing out reference designs

557
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:48,609
from like Marvel or broadcom that we

558
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:51,728
could then extend upon with just open

559
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:55,629
source software to kind of accomplish

560
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:58,059
the same thing without having to build

561
00:20:55,629 --> 00:21:00,189
on top of somebody's existing

562
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:01,960
architecture so I mean and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

563
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's more of the classic open source</font>

564
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,619
model so it's a big chunk that you have

565
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,210
to take on at one time you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

566
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:08,709
kind of suggesting here is this is the

567
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,210
nibble model where I can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

568
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,440
nibble away a little bit just add the

569
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:16,080
things that I really need to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

570
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so thanks for looking</font>

571
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,290
my thickness McDonald's routing system

572
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:29,280
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so it's a comment on question</font>

573
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:30,990
about the changing of I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignis</font>

574
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">mcdonough's routing system so it's a</font>

575
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,400
question comment about the changing of a

576
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,659
control plane component so in a sense as

577
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,910
you present at ripping them off and

578
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,750
replacing with something when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're so</font>

579
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:44,850
how would that possibly affect the total

580
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,890
stability of the control plane and a

581
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,350
whole routing system if we don't have

582
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,030
the mechanism of capabilities and at

583
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,730
least telling the other side of the

584
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">control plane that something is not as</font>

585
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,380
it was before so the mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> devender</font>

586
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,510
proprietary extensions that might be

587
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,130
certain implementations which are

588
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,700
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if we are talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

589
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:07,050
multi-vendor environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

590
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,390
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> be concerned about the</font>

591
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,040
stability aspects of all of this not

592
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,320
negating that it's a good idea and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

593
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,360
has a certain use cases but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

594
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,889
the stability aspect of all of this yeah

595
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,090
that's fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's part of you know</font>

596
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:21,060
with great power<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes great</font>

597
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,649
responsibility you know the folks that

598
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,179
are writing the software now force you

599
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,180
know are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really smart folks and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot</font>

600
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:30,650
I believe as a community we can build

601
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,650
something just as robust as they have

602
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:36,360
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know point is where I want to</font>

603
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">network scribe two questions quickly</font>

604
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,760
what was the reaction of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

605
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,070
when once before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> move to quagga and</font>

606
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,470
the second one and concerns with

607
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,330
security is always and stuff like that

608
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,760
the first one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> they effectively</font>

609
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,350
proposed it or suggested it you know

610
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,520
that in the fact that since<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're Isis</font>

611
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,469
didn't support what I was looking for

612
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,270
you know they're like okay we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

613
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,770
look look at see what's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

614
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved in doing the dev work for you</font>

615
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:03,180
come back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> six months or whatever and</font>

616
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,550
or their second option was or you could

617
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:08,330
do quagga right and then what was your

618
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,330
second question I can remember

619
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,450
again you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks at write code</font>

620
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,679
for us today are really really smart but

621
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,029
I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of us here are really</font>

622
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,470
really sparked collectively as well

623
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,970
right so i think we you know there's

624
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,679
there's no magic wand that they have

625
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:27,080
that makes their stuff more secure than

626
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:29,840
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we can build together scott</font>

627
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,658
white google so how do you handle

628
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,129
packaging so if you have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own top 40</font>

629
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:35,929
developing and you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> continuous</font>

630
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:37,959
integration you know common practice

631
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:40,759
state and you got a vendor who has some

632
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,289
painful 13-week really cycle or whatever

633
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:43,609
are you how are you handling the

634
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:45,109
packaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that come up have you given</font>

635
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:47,059
that any thought haven't given any time

636
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:49,428
so what do you think you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do about</font>

637
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,418
it I'm sorry what I mean well you're

638
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,070
gonna have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with it at some point</font>

639
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:54,440
do you that's fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fair and again</font>

640
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,639
this is more of like proof of concept

641
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,649
like you know we can get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

642
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:59,119
paradigm of having to wait six months 12

643
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:01,668
months for feature we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform in</font>

644
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">which we can do this so you know what we</font>

645
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:04,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to do is now start embracing all</font>

646
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,769
the classic software sort of mechanisms

647
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,738
to you know leverage agile model but not

648
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:12,529
sound so like did<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arista commit to</font>

649
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:15,019
keeping API stable or anything or that's

650
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:18,289
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beauty of it the API is underlying</font>

651
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:25,669
Linux done no SDK nothing just vanilla

652
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:27,889
OS vanilla Linux okay so yeah dr.

653
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:29,840
Montgomery I'm so beyond the the

654
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:32,859
multi-vendor sort of system<font color="#E5E5E5"> effects do</font>

655
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,809
you see any need for the ability to

656
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:38,239
control feature interaction on a on a

657
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:40,820
single platform let's say this takes off

658
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:43,700
wildly and you know many different

659
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:46,039
groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> are adding features to a single</font>

660
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,289
running or outer do you think that's a

661
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:51,499
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be formal</font>

662
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:54,980
support from the platform vendors so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

663
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:58,249
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can imagine</font>

664
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,809
it could be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem right you know and</font>

665
00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:01,549
that's one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we'll worry</font>

666
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:02,658
about that when we get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part I</font>

667
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:05,239
mean I think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be a</font>

668
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:07,369
good problem for us to have right if it

669
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:08,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">becomes wildly successful and we have to</font>

670
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:09,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow deal with the fact that there's</font>

671
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:13,820
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that want to do the same</font>

672
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,840
sort of thing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't in my slides but</font>

673
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,639
it's been something that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

674
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about and I think kind of you</font>

675
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:21,949
know the classic how we do things like I

676
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,820
gp's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think are broken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right maybe</font>

677
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is going to be here</font>

678
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,860
c4 in here but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

679
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">of rethink our models around I GPS and</font>

680
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,408
whatnot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can decouple the different</font>

681
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">groups that are adding different</font>

682
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:34,100
features so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about like Isis</font>

683
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:36,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything's jammed into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

684
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,178
process right wouldnít be really really

685
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,370
cool if I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have AV for Isis</font>

686
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,539
listening on one port another v6 Isis

687
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,518
listen you're on another port and

688
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:45,350
another Isis process during service

689
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,389
discovery and there are independent of

690
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,908
each other right I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font>

691
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">of rethink how we do our networks to</font>

692
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:54,289
kind of allow agility allow these people

693
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,299
to do evolutionary sorts of things and

694
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:57,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about oh crap we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blew up</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the v4 topology because we're adding a</font>

new feature for service discovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

697
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:07,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm Darren laureate might from Microsoft</font>

698
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,929
this was a great work I really like this

699
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:12,769
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about contributing</font>

700
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:15,620
back into the quagga project actually

701
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:17,179
that was a slide ahead and I you know

702
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started doing this you know</font>

703
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,769
internally you know started digging

704
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:23,240
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what's the process for doing</font>

705
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:25,009
open source and this stuff and then I

706
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,590
got this you know forty two page

707
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:29,029
document I needed to fill out and so in

708
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,289
rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill out the document i can</font>

709
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:32,149
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do working but that's</font>

710
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:36,440
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll i won't owned and try to</font>

711
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:38,979
contribute it back yeah microphones are

712
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,799

713
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:46,789
Gary's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gendron why is that so did the</font>

714
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:49,929
vendor allow you to tie your code into

715
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:53,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">the high availability architecture so</font>

716
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:58,429
you know there's a set of platform

717
00:26:53,049 --> 00:27:00,559
services that come with building these

718
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:02,690
features so do they allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

719
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,950
so I didn't I didn't address any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

720
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:10,220
at this point so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then vectors hey</font>

721
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:12,350
Kevin<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ebay I'm curious a sort</font>

722
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,649
of he was Scott with Google's question

723
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,779
how did you actually get your your

724
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:20,928
quagga to to program the routing tables

725
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:22,970
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware without an API yeah so</font>

726
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:24,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">just just leverages existing a West</font>

727
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,840
routes and then pushes those down okay

728
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,970
so so it basically it stinks it to the

729
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,559
OS routing table which already sinks to

730
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,380
the hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep that the way works are</font>

731
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:42,899
I think up

732
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:45,630
okay good great thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you okay thanks</font>

Brian and again um you did a great job

734
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,390
of winning it there too I don't think

735
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,260
anyone would have known they were that

736
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,260
those weren't your real slide

737
