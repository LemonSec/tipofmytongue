1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:13,190
next up we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael Bennett talking</font>

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,190
about energy efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet Michael</font>

3
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,850
okay thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is will be going to</font>

4
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,540
be it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit different layer than</font>

5
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:40,250
we were just talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

6
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,930
talk about sort of frame the discussion

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,600
about why you would have network

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:48,140
interview or interesting even<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,660
energy efficiency and then also explain

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,510
a little bit about energy efficient

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet define it talk about background</font>

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it works what the trade-offs are and</font>

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:02,660
so forth and then how it will work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

14
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,459
optical<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet and then wrapped up</font>

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,690
with some opportunities for development

16
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:12,350
and final<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap up but before I get into</font>

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I need to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my disclaimer</font>

00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,059
statement so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that I</font>

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with respect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I Tripoli here</font>

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,390
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own personal view and not any</font>

21
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:27,710
formal position or explanation or

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:30,619
interpretation of the I Triple E so

23
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">network energy efficiency it's not</font>

24
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:36,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly the lowest hanging fruit in the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">energy efficiency world if you have been</font>

26
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:43,250
following how to make your for example

27
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:45,770
your data center more efficient you

28
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,470
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of using the network is</font>

29
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:52,399
the first place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start thank you too</font>

30
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,979
to achieve energy efficiency and starts

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a process you make some baseline</font>

32
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:58,460
measurements analyze the results and

33
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">then make changes and then improve on</font>

34
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:04,220
that so the the changes that typically

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,470
tend to make the bigger improvements

36
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,810
help to do with optimization<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> airflow</font>

37
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,850
or using more efficient power supplies

38
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:15,220
and that sort of thing then when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

39
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,540
beyond those choosing more efficient

information communication technology

41
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,540
equipment would be the next place to go

42
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,920
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> encountered</font>

43
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,980
along the way when developing energy

44
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,140
efficient ethernet you know people would

45
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,760
ask the question sort of you know you're

46
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a few hundred milliwatts</font>

47
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,459
or water too so<font color="#CCCCCC"> why bother you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

48
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,799
it really worth it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it worth it to go</font>

49
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:40,910
through three or four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of standards</font>

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,350
development and then create

51
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:47,150
standard and then have the industry go

52
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:48,500
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> and build it for a few watts but</font>

53
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,530
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about Ethernet is a</font>

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,590
technology it's probably arguably one of

55
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,630
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful technologies in the</font>

56
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,760
market today over a billion ports in the

57
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:02,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">market so when you look at the numbers</font>

58
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,750
that way it adds up and to put that in

59
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspective excuse me you know we're</font>

60
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,330
talking about data center electricity

61
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,360
alone in 2010 accounted for over one

62
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:21,620
percent of total electricity use so it

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:25,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">does add up the idea here with making</font>

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network energy efficiency is to make the</font>

65
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:31,310
network scale with utilization so when

66
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,680
the utilization goes up then the energy

67
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,990
goes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumption goes up and likewise</font>

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,890
when it goes down then the consumption

69
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:42,920
goes down again just trying to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

question you know well why does that

work in the way that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross some</font>

87
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,240
more savings so you know try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

88
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,390
your network more efficient or your data

<font color="#E5E5E5">for with energy efficiency in the</font>

93
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,790
proportional to the utilization so as

you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> zation increases so with the</font>

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:52,820
power now this this traffic chart I

96
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,650
chose to use as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example over a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> period</font>

97
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,659
of time

98
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,039
sure most of you are network operators

99
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,620
you've seen this sort of chart before

100
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,580
and you see the nice diurnal pattern

101
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,100
over time and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is just</font>

102
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:10,270
simply that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the networks are</font>

103
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:13,570
not full on 24 7 365 that there are some

104
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,490
valleys in those utilization charts and

105
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:20,139
each of those valleys represents an

106
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:22,509
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to save energy so even in</font>

107
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:25,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">this particular case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's Akamai data</font>

set high transaction rate network that

109
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,130
there were valleys there and each of

110
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:33,699
those is an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save energy</font>

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:38,520
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to translate that into</font>

112
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:42,070
dollars you know energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost is still a</font>

113
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,990
significant expense again in data

<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom line or the the biggest number</font>

116
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:52,330
here which is again this is from 2006

117
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:54,340
but the entire United States spent about

118
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,400
four and a half billion dollars and

119
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:06,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">datacenter energy costs so it does add</font>

120
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:08,739
up now getting into ethernet you might

121
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:12,639
wonder well so how much can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say from a</font>

122
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,560
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> interface and depending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on how</font>

123
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,330
you slice the network interface if you

124
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,380
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the physical layer portion</font>

125
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:23,500
of it that part could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduced by</font>

126
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,110
ninety percent and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at more</font>

127
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,669
the network interface you can get on the

128
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,789
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> about seventy percent savings</font>

129
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:34,240
there and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can even get more savings</font>

130
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:40,000
if you're clever about how you design

131
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,440
your system and take advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lldp</font>

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,669
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk a little bit more about</font>

133
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:50,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">this in a slide that I refer to in a few</font>

134
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:54,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">moments so let's talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> energy</font>

135
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:58,240
efficient ethernet or tripoli simply

136
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:02,080
it's a method<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the util the</font>

137
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:06,099
energy use scale with utilization was

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,240
defined back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 22 actually published in</font>

141
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:15,729
attitude 3 2012 and again the premises

142
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,039
is that the links are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fully utilized</font>

143
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:20,530

160
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:09,250
a moment again how does it save energy

161
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,610
well simply power times time in the

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:18,789
active and idle<font color="#CCCCCC"> states you add that up</font>

163
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:21,909
and that's at some your energy use so as

164
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might see then if it's not obvious</font>

165
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:25,419
that it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy efficient to</font>

166
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,650
go to a higher speed because the bit

167
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:31,570
times are shorter so one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to achieve</font>

168
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:35,468
energy efficiency is just simply do a

detail about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> tripoli works the</font>

178
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:06,640
transmitter would be in this case where

179
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:09,339
we have the red block talking about idle

180
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,740
or data if it's sending data<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's any</font>

181
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:14,860

182
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,680
prior to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tripoli that would be normal</font>

183
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,980
idle and you still are utilizing full

184
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,219
power even when you're sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> idol</font>

185
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,440
and I'll signal with Tripoli when

186
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,380
there's no data to send the transmitter

187
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,260
would assert LPI which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

188
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,930
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send a sleep signal indicating</font>

to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> receiver that it's time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font>

192
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,240
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go quiet so at the end of got</font>

193
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,699
these little parameters underneath the

194
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,540
blocks titled<font color="#CCCCCC"> T sub s for a sleep timer</font>

195
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:54,699
or T sub Q for quiet time so the next

196
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">step in low / idle would be when the</font>

197
00:09:54,699 --> 00:10:01,540
line goes quiet and it stays quiet for T

198
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,609
sub Q and then when that timer expires a

199
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,610
reef refresh signal is sent to the

200
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,380
receiver just to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to maintain</font>

201
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">coefficients and be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

202
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the active state as quickly as</font>

203
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,120
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they continue through that</font>

204
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,290
cycle until there's something to send

205
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,209
and then when the transmitter

206
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,089
transmitter determines<font color="#E5E5E5"> their something</font>

207
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:24,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">to send it will send an alert and awake</font>

208
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:30,399
signal and the combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those two</font>

209
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:33,250
times is represented by T sub W Phi so T

210
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,769
W Phi and then there's an option to

211
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,769
extend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time by sending an idle</font>

212
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:41,800
signal and then it goes on into the

213
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:44,290
active state again now why would we have

214
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,050
the second parameter that we call TW sis

215
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,199
which is sent just essentially after the

216
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:52,810
receiver wakes up you still start

217
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:54,579
sending some idle signals and allowing

218
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,099
those idle signals to come in before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

219
00:10:54,579 --> 00:11:01,479
actually start to receive data again

220
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:04,420
well if you can if you can accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

221
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,029
additional time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wake up that creates</font>

222
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,219
an opportunity to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

223
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:11,050
designers to shut other parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

224
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,600
system off but then take that additional

225
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,959
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wake</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything back up again so</font>

226
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:22,139
it enables people who want to design

227
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:26,170
systems that are more efficient to do so

228
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:27,839
now the trade-off here is is that it

229
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,459
takes a little bit more time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wake up</font>

230
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,680
you may wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> what these wakeup times</font>

231
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,689
look like and I've included a few here

232
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,719
to give you sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example</font>

233
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,970
starting with the the worst case which

234
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,010
is a hunter<font color="#E5E5E5"> base TX which is in the</font>

235
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,100
order of 30 micro seconds to wake up and

236
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:47,380
then an example 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> G base t about eight</font>

237
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,270
microseconds to wake up and they're

238
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:53,410
actually even faster with the faster

239
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,180
interfaces the other thing here is so

240
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,079
the the with the link partners again

241
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:04,359
remembering that these are defined for

242
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:07,440
twisted pair interfaces the link

243
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,460
partners will negotiate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise</font>

244
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tripoli capabilities during</font>

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">auto-negotiation once the link is up you</font>

246
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,110
can still communicate using lldp to

247
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,290
notify the link partner<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parameter</font>

248
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,170
changes so if you start it up and went

249
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:26,410
with for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the minimum wake up</font>

250
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:28,000
time the tw5 parameter and then later

251
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,680
determined that you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,810
more efficient mode you could actually

253
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,239
change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameter in the local system</font>

254
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,869
would send an lldp frame to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

255
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,370
side and then actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase the</font>

257
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:46,390
you can control<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system while the link</font>

258

is up now getting a little bit more this

how one might go about getting some

<font color="#E5E5E5">perhaps they're certainly capable of</font>

entering into low power Idol and one

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,550
enough of them are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in i hope our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idle</font>

273
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,310
then you could actually go in and shut

274
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,660
off other parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system in the</font>

275
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,520
whole point of this light is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,490
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bent as an example for</font>

277
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,520

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to design the system so that</font>

you could get even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more energy savings</font>

280
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,949
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade-off if it isn't obvious is</font>

281
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:53,390
latency it takes a little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

282
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:58,100
to wake<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the receiver so as energy use</font>

283
00:13:53,390 --> 00:14:01,280
decreases latency increases and there's

284
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,080
there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cases where you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not be willing to accept this increase</font>

286
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,690
in latency the one case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pull out</font>

287
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,729
that's obvious here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i call</font>

288
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,340
the latency arms race in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Financial</font>

289
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:15,020
Network sector where you know they just

290
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,610
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tolerate any</font>

291
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,590
additional latency and are willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

292
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend lots of money to achieve minimum</font>

293
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,390
latency so it's likely that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Triple E is</font>

294
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,210
not a feature that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

295
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:29,930
considering for their networks on the

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:33,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">other hand when we look at how much</font>

297
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:34,969
latency is increased by Triple E we're

298
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,920
talking about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single-digit</font>

299
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">microseconds for a 10 gigabit network</font>

300
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,530
and in the order<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hundreds of</font>

301
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,329
nanoseconds or even less with this new

302
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:50,800
concept we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> with fast</font>

303
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:53,840
week so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripoli for optical networks</font>

304
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:58,010
it's currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> being specified for 14</font>

305
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,770
gig backplane and optical the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

306
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:05,510
generation optical 100 yeah optical

307
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:08,569
hunter gig so you know cycling into low

308
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:11,600
power Idol it could be problematic<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

309
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:15,200
laser transmitter so one way that we

310
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,540
thought about to work around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is to</font>

311
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,420
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this concept of fast wake</font>

312
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,189
deep sleep we call it deep sleep in the

313
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,689
stander but essentially that's the same

314
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tripoli that we've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

315
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:30,380
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> along so the current proposal and I</font>

316
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,200
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a proposal because the standards</font>

317
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,850
are not quite done yet some of them are

318
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,670
further along and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely they'll</font>

319
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:41,690
complete this way but can't guarantee

320
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:43,959
anything this you signal the<font color="#CCCCCC"> low power</font>

321
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:47,540
Idol<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send this low power Idol signal</font>

322
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,580
without shutting off the transmitter so

323
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,500
then the receiver can take that signal

324
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,690
and still realize that the transmitter

325
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,430
has no<font color="#E5E5E5"> data to send it's not going to</font>

326
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,990
shut off its transmitter it may shut off

327
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,750
other parts of the system that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can</font>

328
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:02,260
then the receiver can respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

329
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,260
accordingly

330
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,680
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was noted in the</font>

331
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,980
development of fast wake is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

332
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,140
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of interface were to connect</font>

333
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,820
to a network that has an optical

334
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,949
transport network on the other end of it

335
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:20,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it has to be carefully done because</font>

336
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,700
there'd have to be some additional

337
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:26,830
mapping between the ethernet no tienen

338
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:29,840
framing the upside is is that it makes

339
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,400
this fast weight concept fairly simple

340
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,410
because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all those timers</font>

341
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,810
we had a moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were talking</font>

342
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,329
about shutting off a network interface

343
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,180
powering<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the transmitter so going</font>

344
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> picture it might look like</font>

345
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:49,370
as simple as going between the active

346
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:51,680
idle mode to sending the LPI signal by

347
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:55,400
itself and then back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> act of idle</font>

348
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,989
again but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system's</font>

349
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,760
designers have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something with that</font>

350
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:05,300
signal in order to achieve the energy

351
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:09,530
efficiency so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential to save</font>

352
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:12,220
energy here exists but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

353
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:16,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">essential for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network equipment</font>

354
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:22,160
manufacturers to to do something with

355
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:23,810
that fast wake signal so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

356
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's crucial that that's going to have</font>

357
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be done otherwise you just basically</font>

358
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may save a little bit of energy but</font>

359
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:36,410
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even as much as you would with the</font>

360
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:39,230
traditional Tripoli<font color="#CCCCCC"> when will this be</font>

361
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:41,300
available so the next generation what we

362
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,640
call a<font color="#E5E5E5"> next-generation hunter gag optics</font>

363
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:47,570
standard is currently scheduled to be

364
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,310
completed in 2015 so these tools will

365
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:53,030
become available<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the first case</font>

366
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:55,639
where this fast wake will actually be

367
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,730
available and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the tools are being</font>

368
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,540
created now again it's up to the

369
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:04,040
manufacturers to make them useful for us

370
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,050
and it's I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think really important that</font>

371
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,970
end-users are asking the network

372
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,830
equipment manufacturers to provide these

373
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,400
tools so that we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of</font>

374
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,580
them just in terms of opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

375
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,080
development

376
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,879
again this was I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to read</font>

377
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">these all off to you but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted</font>

378
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">to give you a sense of what's being</font>

379
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,240
developed and I Triple E for Ethernet

380
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:31,700
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where Tripoli is showing up or will</font>

381
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,840
show up there there's interestingly

382
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:37,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet is getting into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> automotive</font>

383
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,320
field so you you know sometime in the

384
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,019
next five to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years there will be an</font>

385
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet network running in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your car it</font>

386
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:48,960
will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some form of tripoli in it and</font>

387
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,880
then again next generation hunter gig

388
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,460
optical<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethernet is coming down the pike</font>

389
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,190
next year likewise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think 40 and 100</font>

390
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,730
gig<font color="#E5E5E5"> backplane will finish late this year</font>

391
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,679
or maybe early next year<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40g bass-t i</font>

392
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:06,649
think is a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years out a couple three</font>

393
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:09,389
years out and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite 8023 BS</font>

394
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:12,439
which is not a typo that's really what

395
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:15,779
they called it 400<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gigabit Ethernet</font>

396
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,100
which just started and went into tau

397
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:22,529
sport mode horse mode earlier this year

398
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:26,250
so fast wake is either being specified

399
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:30,690
or will be specified in some of these

400
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:32,940
projects and again it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

401
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,019
if you care about energy efficiency for

402
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,120
the equipment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to be</font>

403
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:39,870
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your networks it's important</font>

404
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk to your equipment manufacturers</font>

405
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:45,389
and ask for the feature but in addition

406
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:48,000
to that when the 400 gig project for

407
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:51,299
example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

408
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,230
take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tripoli works and ask</font>

409
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:56,730
questions like can it be improved or you

410
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,380
know is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better way to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this or</font>

411
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:02,490
should we just continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use what we</font>

412
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:05,370
have been one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's being</font>

413
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:09,299
considered since this is a new speed and

414
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:11,729
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> five project is considering shutting</font>

415
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,740
down lanes to save energy this

416
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduces an interesting idea but</font>

417
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,600
because in the example that i give here

418
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,908
if you have a 4 x 100 lane design and

419
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,649
you decide that you only you know you're

422
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,610
shut down a couple of lanes but it's

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">could shut down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the lanes but how does</font>

425
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:35,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look to the rest of your network</font>

426
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,620
and that's an open question how do we do

427
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,510
that do we continue to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

428
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:43,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">a 400 gig interface but you only have</font>

429
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:46,799
200 gigs available you know it's to be

430
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">determined if that even happens one</font>

431
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,620
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought was really</font>

432
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:54,600
interesting at the last at the last

433
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,860
plenary meeting nor interim meeting

434
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,750
rather that Joel<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gorgon had presented</font>

435
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,928
before his his presentation was titled

436
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,940
400 gig electrical interface thoughts

437
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:08,700
Joel's I believe a distinguished and

438
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,000
engineer at cisco and a backplane expert

439
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,850
and he had been<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a number</font>

440
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas that he had for the</font>

441
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,928
next generation electrical interface but

442
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,510
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought was interesting is he</font>

443
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:25,889
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if they keep designing systems</font>

444
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:27,779
the way they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been that next</font>

445
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:30,570
generation systems would approach 100

446
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:33,059
kilowatts iraq and that's just not

447
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">sustainable you know we can't do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

448
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:39,360
know that not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too long ago when I worked</font>

449
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,129
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> es net that we were facing the same</font>

450
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,320
problems at a lower order of magnitude

451
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:45,570
where we're looking at next generation

452
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,580
systems and bumping up about against

453
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,899
power constraints there so it's a

454
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,639
problem that really does need to be

455
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:56,100
solved so Joel suggested that using a

456
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:58,799
different approach in the thirties power

457
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,719
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may lead to yet another form of</font>

458
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,510
Tripoli and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chip two chip interface</font>

459
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:09,330
so those are sort of the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

460
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:11,610
that are happening so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripoli will</font>

461
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:15,299
actually improve energy efficiency of

462
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:19,019
information internet information connect

463
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:23,549
all connect ICT from tripping over that

464
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:28,039
one the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of energy that's that can</font>

465
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:30,480
be saved by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripoli depends on the</font>

466
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:33,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of time that the network is not</font>

467
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,460
utilized so but the goal here again is

468
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:38,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the network energy proportional</font>

469
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,320
so that if you do have useful work to be

470
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,420
done by the network

471
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,399
then the energy use goes up that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

472
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,130
you're actually using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network but we</font>

473
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:50,090
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be burning power unnecessarily</font>

474
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:52,460
during periods of idle time again the

475
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:56,419
trade-off here is is going to be with

476
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,370
latency we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about really in</font>

477
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:03,470
the order of<font color="#E5E5E5"> single-digit microseconds</font>

478
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:06,139
or less for modern networks and again

479
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:09,950
Triple E is coming for optical networks

480
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:12,620
and 2015 there's possible improvements

481
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:15,590
they'll be coming with 400<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gigabit</font>

482
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet but it's fairly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new so it's yet</font>

483
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,510
to be seen overall though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think things</font>

484
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,820
are good for Tripoli but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

485
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,370
important my sort of takeaway here is

486
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,990
that again if you care about energy

487
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,209
efficiency for your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment</font>

488
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,400
then you really do need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

489
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:35,150
network equipment manufacturers to make

490
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,360
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen and that's it so I'll take any</font>

491
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,360
questions

492
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,640
looks like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> done thank you very much</font>

493
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,350
you
