1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:19,180
oswalt giving us current in futures for

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:20,529
open daylight cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks men are</font>

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,150
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tag-team</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this a little bit this</font>

4
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:24,220
kind of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> update from the one we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did a</font>

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,140
couple times<font color="#E5E5E5"> back so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll just give you</font>

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little idea of what opendaylight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,560
early how many people know what open

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:34,090
daylight is a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so and</font>

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,360
we'll try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll try to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">fast so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is hydrogen we named the</font>

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
releases all by the elements we did a

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,269
doodle poll this is what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,719
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have since what we did I'll</font>

14
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:49,600
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little bit of what's gone on</font>

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,320
and then mental pick it up and take the

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">rest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so what is open daylight um</font>

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,609
this kind of the canonical slide it's an

18
00:00:55,089 --> 00:01:00,608
open source project to build sort of an

19
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,980
SDN platform it's housed under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux</font>

20
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">foundation they give us all of the sort</font>

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">of marketing IT and all that kind of</font>

22
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,159
support on the goal is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> create a piece</font>

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,020
of code or a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> code that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,630
basically open source and covers the

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,860
major pieces of some kind of SDN

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:22,179
solution and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to have it</font>

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,770
adopted by the industry an example of

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,900
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be like open V</font>

29
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,149
switch people<font color="#E5E5E5"> build that into their</font>

30
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,730
products they can pick it up as open

31
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:34,030
source and others things like that so we

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">want vendor steves attune and one of the</font>

33
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,030
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned over the over the year</font>

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,130
or so that I've been involved with this

35
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,470
is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community aspect of it is</font>

36
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">most important so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can slap on some</font>

37
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,020
kind of open source license on your code

38
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,970
put it up on github but that's not going

39
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,580
to make it open source what rming it

40
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:55,179
normally but the real power of it is in

41
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,550
the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're we building well</font>

42
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,410
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a community as I said that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

43
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,660
main thing but evolved will bless DN

44
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,369
platform so contrast<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with like a</font>

45
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,500
controller right we want this thing to

46
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:09,519
be able to be very configurable very

47
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,110
modular common obstructions for

48
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,860
northbound API is people have to be able

49
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to write to stable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AP ice on whatever we</font>

50
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,450
need in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect that to</font>

51
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,319
the southbound and programmable services

52
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,909
that are underneath

53
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,140
and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you need applications</font>

54
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:27,700
that run on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing to make it useful</font>

55
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:30,189
and glue of all different<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds to make</font>

56
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,069
it work including engineering systems so

57
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:34,870
this is things like tool chains how you

58
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,510
do collaboration and all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

59
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff so here's what it looks like this</font>

60
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,149
is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope of the thing in the</font>

61
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:42,909
middle there's kind of this controller

62
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,340
platform I was telling you about I'll

63
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:47,168
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it watch the timer on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the south side</font>

64
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it there's plugins so protocols are</font>

65
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:52,870
pluggable on the south side and on the

66
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,430
north side there's rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> ap ice not</font>

67
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,280
surprisingly you can also write to the

68
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,680
Java API sir on the north side of it if

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,669
you need to for performance issues

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,219
usually who's in it well you know

71
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:08,159
everybody or at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least most most of the</font>

72
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendors are in it there's kind of three</font>

73
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,638
membership levels and I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

74
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">this but basically you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font>

75
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,489
a member to either get the code or

76
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:17,590
contribute you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> even get on</font>

77
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,090
the on the technical steering committee

78
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,280
or even on the board without being a

79
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,189
member<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Platinum membership comes</font>

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,659
with some you know some board seats and

81
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:27,250
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then gold and</font>

82
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:30,638
silver have their own things but so

83
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,340
there's a quite a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know</font>

84
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar names involved so what did we</font>

85
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">do we've been working on this for about</font>

86
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:40,750
a year a little more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a year and</font>

87
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,900
it's open daylight it's really

88
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,269
multi-project so we tried to bring all

89
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,829
the projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to together</font>

90
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:49,780
into what's called<font color="#CCCCCC"> the simultaneous</font>

91
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:52,209
release kind of a common thing in the

92
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,189
open source world and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned we</font>

93
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,079
named it hydrogen and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> planned to</font>

94
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:58,540
release it less<font color="#E5E5E5"> December that was our</font>

95
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,340
plan and we kind of grouped up the

96
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,828
functionality together and kind of had

97
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,659
what were basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> editions there's a</font>

98
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:06,009
base edition which you know what you can

99
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:08,078
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it was like an open flow</font>

100
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,458
controller there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

101
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,370
addition because there were parts from

102
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,840
virtualization functionality in there

103
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,599
and then there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service provider</font>

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">edition I'll show you what those all are</font>

105
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,719
although I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go faster here's the</font>

106
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,339
simultaneous release plan all of these

107
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:22,750
i'm just showing this have to read it

108
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,448
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just showing you this because these</font>

109
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,219
open source projects all have a plan

110
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,930
that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this there's milestones</font>

111
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:31,210
then there's release candidates and then

112
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,850
you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

113
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,530
well it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get there we kind</font>

114
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,620
of got around we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> around to releasing</font>

115
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,630
it around februari these were<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

116
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,470
projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were in it as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

117
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,509
there's a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

118
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">things i'll just mention right here that</font>

119
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:48,400
for the service provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition um</font>

120
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,710
what was in there were things like BG

121
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,150
pls and peace up because you know it was

122
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of thought that ok that's traffic</font>

123
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,210
engineering and then a lot of other

124
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,530
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we group</font>

125
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,870
that together but that was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

126
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">main things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was in there we did</font>

127
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,110
OpenStack integration this is a picture

128
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,900
of it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> works it</font>

129
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,699
basically that the open sec integration

130
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,239
was basically a pastor of the neutron

131
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:12,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">api into open daylight which basically</font>

132
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,280
pushed all the complexity into open

133
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,739
daylight the design of neutron is is

134
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,880
sort of in flux right now how much

135
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:25,210
smarts should be in there um<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

136
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,030
that's a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> story there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I'll keep</font>

137
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,710
going then here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> helium thing I</font>

138
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,568
just put up the periodic table because

139
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,979
the first thing was hydrogen obviously

140
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:37,389
the next one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be helium and</font>

141
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,770
so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> um again a release plan that</font>

142
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,810
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the last one the reason that</font>

143
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have this is because we want to get</font>

144
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,710
on a deterministic cadence so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

145
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,789
a new release of this every six months

146
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:51,609
basically and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go helium lithium on</font>

147
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:54,550
and so forth what's in helium just tons

148
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,099
of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> including all of this policy</font>

149
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:00,639
stuff some packet cable stuff which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

150
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:03,099
kind of interesting on I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pick</font>

151
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,030
out one here for you TTP's our table

152
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:10,599
typing patterns which were intended to

153
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:12,099
restrict the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenFlow 13 spec enough so</font>

154
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,039
you could actually implement it on real

155
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:17,620
hardware and all kinds of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

156
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,310
so there'll be a lot of interesting

157
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,810
stuff in helium<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so here's a brief</font>

158
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,310
note on the project<font color="#CCCCCC"> life cycle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

159
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,620
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> life cycle these things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all have</font>

160
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,699
project life cycles right and in just

161
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,340
like you would have in any other

162
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,599
software but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key thing here and this</font>

163
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,698
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I want you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

164
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,680
highlighted here was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have</font>

165
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be a member to bring a project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

166
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,909
open daylight it's an open source

167
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:42,910
project anybody can do it so and we've

168
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">had it a lot of the projects that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

169
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:48,880
and hydrogen were actually brought by

170
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:51,909
non-members<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your turn I</font>

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just</font>

172
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,090
talk about this so the thing about

173
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,160
lithium is ok that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get</font>

174
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,940
now two releases ahead and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

175
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,790
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to be very</font>

176
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,560
deterministic and that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

177
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,910
consumers and it's also good for the

178
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,100
developers because they need to know

179
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,820
when they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hit these milestones</font>

180
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:11,230
in order to get into these releases so

181
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,610
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit too early for projects</font>

182
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,950
for lithium because that's one release

183
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,390
ahead but we already built this right so

184
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,909
this should look familiar to everybody

185
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:24,180
after the first two it's the same just

186
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:24,180
shifted in time by six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font>

187
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,940
hello my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Meadows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Walt and I just</font>

188
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to really briefly some up sort of</font>

189
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,900
my experience in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and we had as Dave</font>

190
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,360
mentioned we had a release in February

191
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,520
of hydrogen for open daylight and we had

192
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,400
a summit that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wrapped up that</font>

193
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,770
that that release in santa clara i

194
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,070
believe it was and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one of my</font>

195
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,719
favorite quotes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that was was open</font>

196
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,490
daylight isn't just for developers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

197
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,110
think that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest one of</font>

198
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest key points for me</font>

199
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,230
specifically and for a lot of folks that

200
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,820
i work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know the general</font>

201
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,900
the general idea that i try to

202
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,040
communicate to folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that want to get</font>

203
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,960
involved is that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

204
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,020
really have to know code to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be involved</font>

205
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this community they've really he</font>

206
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,680
hit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great point with this with this</font>

207
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:17,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">concept is that community is huge with</font>

208
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,380
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opendaylight project one of the</font>

209
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:26,049
ways one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ways that we tried to</font>

210
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:27,159
what have you there we go one of the

211
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,110
ways one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ways that i tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

212
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,940
illustrate this point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have this i</font>

213
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,229
did a talk recently on this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

214
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,429
i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i want to illustrate with</font>

215
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,229
the concept of network programmability

216
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,270
is that one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most fundamental</font>

217
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,610
things that you can use in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

218
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">SDN talks that you probably hear about</font>

219
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know programmability</font>

220
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,820
is awesome but ultimately you're still

221
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,810
going to depend on a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard</font>

222
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,400
protocols that we use on a day-to-day

223
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,560
basis and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit hammer this home</font>

224
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,120
with both developers and network folks

225
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,849
because ultimately that's going to be

226
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,710
the biggest key in understanding this so

227
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,790
with respect to open day

228
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,440
one of the best things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can do</font>

229
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,160
to get involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> as just networking</font>

230
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,240
professionals like myself is is one of

231
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,949
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the use cases is a</font>

232
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,020
sanity check for matching on protocols

233
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,200
we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of talks recently</font>

234
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,400
specifically with matching flow state

235
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,350
when if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have for instance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

236
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,709
matching<font color="#CCCCCC"> on an ether type and you know</font>

237
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:21,080
that ethertype says the packet is ipv4

238
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:22,730
however the packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't ipv4 to ipv6 I</font>

239
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,960
mean silly stuff like that you'd be

240
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,060
surprised how useful that kind of

241
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,660
knowledge is maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> more maybe more</font>

242
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,579
specific you're matching<font color="#E5E5E5"> on ipv6</font>

243
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:34,579
neighbor discovery packets but the the

244
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,200
address doesn't match the the format

245
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,400
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

246
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,770
knowledge is actually really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

247
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,240
valuable in this community and there's

248
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,890
many many use cases where somebody could

249
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,970
sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just look at a list of</font>

250
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,860
features that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been added recently</font>

251
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,150
and just do that sanity check and make

252
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,170
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they match you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

253
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,870
what they're supposed to be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

254
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,280
protocol perspective we're also

255
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,750
implementing a lot of standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> and code</font>

256
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,220
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> gav pointed out we've got a lot of</font>

257
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,260
projects that implement you know various

258
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,550
protocols and libraries that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

259
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,990
simply don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist yet in the open</font>

260
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,180
source world or at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least not in this</font>

261
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,220
modular fashion so another thing that's

262
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,510
useful is is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to test and</font>

263
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,520
integrate a lot of these projects with

264
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,720
existing gear an existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> software its</font>

265
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,360
top software that we're used to using

266
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">every day so in summary this is in my</font>

267
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,180
opinion one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the best communities that</font>

268
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can that's that exists out there to</font>

269
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,870
chase that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pyramid that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> illustrated</font>

270
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,280
and basically enforcing that idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

271
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,560
network fundamentals are still just that

272
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,819
fundamentals and and they're they're

273
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,959
going to be the key you know resource

274
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,140
and doing all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that we've been</font>

275
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about i'm on twitter most of the</font>

folks in the community on twitter but

277
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,330
IRC is probably the best place to reach

278
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,070

so for example the traffic from A to M /

00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:05,269
that would override the classic internet

425
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:07,730
rod with the next stop specifying the

426
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:10,940
exit point and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> label specifying the</font>

427
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP pairing segment it could be a VPN v4</font>

428
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,340
route but an obvious way to program it

429
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,019
is to use a pset programming so that's

430
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,119
the one I described in this case the

431
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:23,059
other models are explained in the draft

432
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:26,178
so the controller would send a pset

433
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:28,629
message to<font color="#CCCCCC"> l2 say a please build a</font>

434
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:31,309
segment running traffic entering tunnel

435
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:34,039
this tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> consists in pushing two</font>

436
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:37,519

437
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:39,440
node segment you see it it will fall it

438
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,950
will steer the traffic to see on the

439
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,059
shortest path to see the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> level is</font>

440
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:48,950

441
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:52,960
allocated for the bottom link to F and

442
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:55,669
so by creating that policy and the

443
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,970
traffic steering policy that says all

444
00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:01,159
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic from A to M</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> / I should go</font>

445
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,649
over the tunnel when the traffic gets to

446
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:06,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">a it's ratted on the tunnel the two</font>

447

448

449
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:16,240
next label is 1042 so C is going to

450
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:20,389
receive a packet where the top level is

451
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:24,320
1042 1042 is popped and the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

452

sent on the related interface to F and

453
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,119
so the traffic entering decision which

454
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,179
was to steer the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic from A to M</font>

523
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,560
expanding the test bed so I'd love to

often using software-defined networking

538
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,479
and the rise of mobile has changed how

we interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the internet and also</font>

540
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,690
brought it into places that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were kind of</font>

these growth and innovation in all these

549
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,790
problem well<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP contributes to a number</font>

of known problems on the internet and

551
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,139
I've listed a number of them here it's

on so for the rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

how do we do research today on inter

569
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,160
domain routing one way is via simulation

570
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,050
or emulations and the great thing about

571
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,490
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you have complete control</font>

572
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:19,250
of your experiment and complete

573
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,990
visibility into your experiment but the

574
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,910
experiments will only be as realistic as

575

your ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to configure them properly</font>

580

603
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,620
much of our connectivity today is via

604
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,360
am-6 who have generously been hosting us

605
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,679
for the last year we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have</font>

606
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,179
connectivity at a number of universities

607
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:46,050
but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use amex as an</font>

experiment so i can run something on my

613
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,910
laptop and then hook it up via this

614
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:07,860
peering router so what that means is

615
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,540
that the peering router essentially acts

616
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,629
as a multiplexer allowing multiple

617
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:15,000
experiments to run behind it each of

618
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,500
these experiments<font color="#E5E5E5"> will use a private</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS</font>

619
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,310
number to establish appearing with

appearing router the multiplexer will

621
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,149
then transparently provide them with

622
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,730
connectivity to each of our actual peers

623
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,890
and then in my experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can run</font>

624
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,870
whatever topology I want which we

625
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,250
emulate using an extended version of

626
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,580
mini net which is an emulation

627
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:39,990
environment we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can peer using say quagga</font>

628
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:41,639
to establish that pairing session once

629
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,090
i'm running this experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

630
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,260
advertise out prefixes as i like

631
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,919
including specifying which appears they

632
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:53,010
go to and which ones they don't go to

633
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,900
the multiplexer will pass on the

634
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,030
announcements that it receives to each

635
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,650
of the experiments there then free to

636
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">choose whichever routes they want and</font>

637
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,279
exchange traffic with the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point I assumed that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

649
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,918
people like Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush had access to you</font>

650
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:37,199
know these resources they could use a

651

<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to establish purines but there</font>

653
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,619

00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:05,580
also put in place safety<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example</font>

664
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:07,229
filters to prevent bad traffic or bad

665
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,269
routes hijack spoofing things like that

666
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:11,789
can also put in place rate limits on

667
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:14,789
announcements in traffic and this also

668
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:18,029
allows us to centralize relationships so

669
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:19,440
other a esas only need to peer with our

built a software-defined internet

for specifying policy over appearing

685
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,228
fabric and gives you more fine-grained

686

control than you might have today we had

687

a project last year on tracking down the

root cause of path changes so if a path

689
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:07,019

<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what triggered that change</font>

00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:00,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">the difficulty in running experiments</font>

711
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:02,440
our test beds intended to overcome this

712
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:05,709
hurdle and enable new types of research

713
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,820
by enabling researchers to define<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SNS</font>

714
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,320
of their choice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then actually</font>

715
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:13,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect them on the internet to exchange</font>

716
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:17,529
traffic and routes I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

717
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:19,419
with people here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular we want</font>

718
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:21,190
to do a meaningful research and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

719
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,570
are the best sources of problems so I'd

720
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,460
love to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you about what</font>

721
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,739
problems in turn domain routing you have

722
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,869
that you think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should look at we're</font>

723
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:30,309
also looking to expand our<font color="#CCCCCC"> testbed so</font>

724
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:32,470
far we've mainly been looking at

725
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:35,168
internet exchanges and remote peering

726
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:37,149
options just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us expand</font>

727
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:39,039
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> testbed quickly but I would love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

728
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:42,428
talk to anyone who's interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

729
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,399
purane with us or hosting our testbed we

730
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:50,799
have I have a contact email up there bgp

733
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:56,230
person I'll be around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the rest of</font>

734
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:58,320
the week thanks a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and happy to take</font>

735
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,320
questions

736
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:10,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">mad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PTAC Yahoo perhaps I misunderstood</font>

737
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,030
but did you actually say you want to

738
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">open this up for random people to run</font>

739
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,070
experiments feeding prefixes out under

740
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,020
the global<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet um not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> random people</font>

741
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,179
but i do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open it up to</font>

742
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,670
researchers so we have a committee<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

743
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,260
vets experiments we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> in place</font>

744
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,330
filters so you can only make

745
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,340
announcements for our prefixes that are

746
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,179
under our control we<font color="#CCCCCC"> also rate limit the</font>

747
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,679
rate at which you can make those

748
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,140
announcements we keep that keeps you

749
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,420
from being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hijack leak caused</font>

750
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,010
too much turn we limit the traffic that

751
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can send both by rate limit in it</font>

752
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,390
and by keeping you from spoofing so

753
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially we can only impact routes to</font>

754
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,240
our prefix and you can only send and

755
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,100
receive traffic to our prefix and it's

756
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,990
all at a low rate and the other piece

757
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,629
was you so that researchers could pick

758
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,880
LS<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers to use or do you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

759
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:57,970
specific so you have any s number it's

760
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,680
for 7065 behind that individual

761
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:01,810
experiments will use private highest

762
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,950
numbers those<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stripped out before</font>

763
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,780
they're announced to the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

764
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,610
so all experiments behind our testbed

765
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,940
look to the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world like it's</font>

766
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:11,409
for 7065 but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a / 19 we might sub</font>

767
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,640
divide that into<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 s and different</font>

768
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,960
experiments use different that's much

769
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,810
cooler than<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

770
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,790
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not explaining eclair so yet</font>

771
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:20,409
it's entirely transparent from the

772
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,690
experiments point of view it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

773
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:24,040
they're the only experiment running from

774
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,290
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Internet's point of view</font>

775
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,510
it looks like just for 7065 making

776
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:31,690
different announcements thanks for the

777
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:33,790
questions sorry it wasn't clear any

778
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,320
other questions i'll be around at the

779
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,490
socials both nights and around all day

780
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,730
tomorrow so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love to chat more with</font>

781
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,730
people

782
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:57,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so we'll come to the end of our</font>

783
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,600
programming today since you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the</font>

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,419
benefit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> always programming we'd</font>

785
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,299
appreciate if you could fill out the pc

786
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:06,970
survey on an in our website to let us

787
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:09,369
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you thought we will be back</font>
