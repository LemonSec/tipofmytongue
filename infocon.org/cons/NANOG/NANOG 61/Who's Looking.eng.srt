interesting work he's been doing in

headquarters isn't brilliant and but

17
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,710
this is kind of from the sublime to the

18
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:00,000
ridiculous in terms of topic because

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,619
it's one of those sort of strange things

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,860
you see in the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind of go</font>

21

that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant to happen we've been</font>

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,790
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over the last couple</font>

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,520
of years in trying to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

24
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet from the perspective of of all</font>

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,600
of us in other words looking at the

network from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point of view</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,048
user and one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this oddly enough</font>

28
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,939
is to use one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most remarkable</font>

29
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,109
pieces of technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have ever</font>

30
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,148
invented which is the online ad<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

31
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:34,079
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it adds a</font>

32
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:36,299
programmable they embed flash code and

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,178
you can do things inside ads you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,280
what makes the ad animate but you can do

35
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:45,920
lots of other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things as well and adds</font>

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,560
give you the ability to put code in

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,799
millions of people's machines just

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,399
quietly doing very small tests and most

39
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,310
of the time it's just get this URL and

40
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:02,189
if the URL happens to only work in v6

41
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,119
you can start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what's the</font>

42
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:08,940
users view of v6 or if for example the

43
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,450
dns name of that URL happens to be

44
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,819
signed with DNS SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can look at the</font>

45
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,700
amount of use of users of DNS SEC

46
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,280
validation you can do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those kinds</font>

47
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,440
of things with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us very simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ad</font>

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,330
just embeddings in code so we do around

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,760
you know half a million of these tests

50
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,630
every single day and the beauty of the

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,480
ad network is Google try bloody hard to

52
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,160
make sure every day I get fresh eyeballs

53
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,049
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that you know the same half</font>

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,989
a million folk get victimized by this

55
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,880
really crap add the the pain is shared

56
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,130
across literally millions if not

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,730
hundreds of millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users this is</font>

58
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:52,250
fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's even better is that</font>

59
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:56,010
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't click on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I don't pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

60
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,590
the trick is to make an ad that is so

61
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,929
bland and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no one clicks on it</font>

62
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,380
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know don't click here does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

63
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,090
work by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> does not work and click</font>

64
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,190
me doesn't work for much the same reason

65
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have to make it so bland it's not</font>

66
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,120
funny but we're kind of got there we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

67
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:16,050
about half a million in ads a day for a

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,030
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bargain so one</font>

69
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,540
of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really stuffs things</font>

70
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,150
up in this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AD work is caching</font>

71
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,850
caching is evil because what I want is

72
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,370
for you to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my service I don't</font>

73
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,290
want no crap cashing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way so I</font>

74
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,769
tried really really hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

75
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that everything I do every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single time</font>

76
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,650
and add gets delivered the URL dirty and

77
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,510
its name is unique never appear before

78
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,060
never going to appear again right so

79
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,160
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> deliver this add to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your going to</font>

80
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,180
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to me and do some things with</font>

81
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:55,200
me and nobody else nobody else in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

82
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:59,519
room is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right right so</font>

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,730
at times I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see this 22nd of</font>

84
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,709
January someone in henan mobile

85
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,899
communications in Japan went and got

86
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">something this is cool this is normal</font>

87
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,540
there's a bunch of digits there but a

88
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,820
little bit further<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in the logs</font>

89
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:18,149
exactly sixty eight seconds later it's

90
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:23,159
precisely the same get string from

91
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:26,310
somebody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not right that's not</font>

92
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,550
right so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of go well that's</font>

93
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,969
fascinating I wonder how often this

94
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,489
happens so I started looking

95
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:38,879
and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hot like hey let's start at</font>

96
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:42,929
the side of this year 2014 and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

97
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:47,729
see how many times has happened so up

98
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:50,849
until last friday 61 million<font color="#CCCCCC"> God Google</font>

99
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:53,339
is good<font color="#CCCCCC"> 65 million unique</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end-user IP</font>

100
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:58,558
addresses you know had these ads

101
00:04:53,339 --> 00:05:01,399
delivered to them and 110,000 appeared

102
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:05,069
to have a stalker now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of go</font>

103
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:08,009
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 in 500 it's actually a bit higher</font>

104
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:12,389
than that because there's a fair deal of

105
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:14,189
incidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gnats in fact there are</font>

106
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:16,919
sooo seems to me from much the same

107
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:19,349
mechanism around three to four percent

108
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,899
of the world's users are now sitting

109
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:24,419
behind carrier-grade<font color="#CCCCCC"> nats that use IP</font>

110
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:26,939
address pools with really aggressive

111
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:29,039
timeouts less than 10 seconds says a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

112
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,379
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> natin around which makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one in</font>

113
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,699
five hundred figure a bit low i think

114
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:37,110
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a bit higher than that a</font>

115
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,999
much higher a bit hard but 110,000 folk

116
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,489
are being stalked so what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this say</font>

117
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:43,979
about privacy what does this say about

118
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:46,558
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's my browser</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font>

122
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:03,389
the stalking rates by country and you

123
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:07,279
can so if you're in lao three percent of

124

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> urls in lao have attracted a stalker</font>

two and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> half percent in macau china</font>

126
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:19,439
one-point-four percent you can read as

127
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:22,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">well as i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can us a half a percent second</font>

128
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,949
time singapore slightly lower that's a

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,599
strange<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of countries now this is</font>

these places<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they do strange things</font>

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,610

144
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,130

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,120
sample rates are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite good so</font>

146
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:10,469
it's reasonable data so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know quarter</font>

149
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:23,120
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the stalkers those 1579</font>

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,460
stores networks that appearing over

151
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,180
collectively our shoulders looking at

152
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,960
everything we're doing how long does it

153
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,070
take for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the store could have activate</font>

154
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,020
that's kind of interesting that's a

155
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,300
stalking delay it's a log scale so it

156
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,859
gets a bit interesting a huge number of

157
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,780
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stalks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen in the first three</font>

158
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,190
seconds you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere it goes</font>

159
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere you go somewhere it goes</font>

160
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere there's a small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peak at ten</font>

161
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:53,570
seconds interesting my script that

162
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,490
you're executing has a wait 10 seconds

163
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:59,310
so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about your machine</font>

164
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's code that causes that little</font>

165
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,380
blip around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 seconds and there's a</font>

166
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:08,099
huge blip at half a day 12 hours of the

167
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,469
other end some kind of proxy with some

168
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,440
kind of timer so you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 seconds</font>

169
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,600
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try the same experiment without</font>

170
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,340
the 10 second timer and this is a

171
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,010
different piece of the same experiment

172
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,650
there's no internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 second timer now</font>

173
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:26,300
there's a massive peak at half an hour

174
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:28,679
and one hour so I'm kind of thinking

175
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's two kind of stalkers out</font>

176
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,140
there you'll have invited<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them</font>

177
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,838
into your house into your browser your

178
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,120
browser is sitting there waiting for the

179
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,099
scripts in a page to execute and as soon

180
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,770
as everything's finished it activates

181
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,870
some reports home and that's that

182
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,270
ten-second gaps talking that I'm seeing

183
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,339
that you're loaded up this crap it's

184
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,410
your fault you're being stalked it's on

185
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">your machine whether you invited the</font>

186
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,980
minarets of virus I don't know your

187
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,569
problem but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

188
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,520
percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stalking that's precisely</font>

189
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,530
that the second result

190
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,380
so that there's an awful lot of

191
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,689
intercepting middleware and some of its

192
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,580
kind of I must<font color="#E5E5E5"> refresh what the user</font>

193
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,160
retrieved I must get it again in 30

194
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,770
seconds and 60 seconds that auto refresh

195
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,000
cycle so inside this there's a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

196
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,680
and a bit of you so who are they all of

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,650
you in the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> three rows that's who</font>

198
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,170
they are federal of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google with a fair</font>

199
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,370
deal of time delay in stalking it might

200
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,890
be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with their web</font>

the top something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in China net so those</font>

205
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:47,340
are sort of the stalkers and you kind of

206
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,290
think well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I've just</font>

209
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,469
addresses and figure out which one other

210
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:58,830
256 is it my hideously clever<font color="#E5E5E5"> attempt to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hide their identity year right could</font>

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,360
this be web proxies could you be going

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,400
through something that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually doing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the URL harvesting as it goes through</font>

the firewall whatever so a strong

216
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,520
indicator of that is it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same a</font>

217
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,070
SS me so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look through that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,820
the stalker and the victim are in the

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,460
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS let's just throw them out and</font>

221
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,890
see what's left well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of</font>

222
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,690
workplace relations is is thrown out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

223
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:32,400
maybe they're relieved about this and up

224
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:33,990
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> above net interesting and a whole</font>

225
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,150
lot of Chinese networks are now doing

226
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,690
that in that top list so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

227
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:42,540
folk who have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different AAS from the</font>

228
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,910
victim so whatever's going on the

229
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,290
stalker is in another network might be

230
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,510
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path still it might be on the</font>

231
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,130
wire I don't know haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked there's</font>

232
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,840
still a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Google there but that's</font>

233
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sort of refined list and you kind of</font>

234
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,930
go well you know I've heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

235
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,700
Great Firewall of China you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

236
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,310
maybe this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about nation-states</font>

237
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,940
getting worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their citizens it</font>

238
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:10,319
happens so why don't I do one more

239
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,000
filter so i'll use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR stats because</font>

240
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,810
you know it's quick and it's easy and

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,790
it's mildly

242
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,910
accurate not fantastically but good

243
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:20,550
enough and get rid of all the folk where

244
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:24,000
the victim and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stalker are in the</font>

245
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:28,699
same country aha so who's stalking

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,800
across borders this group of people

247
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:35,160
chinanet backbone is still up there is

248
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,140
number one covenant<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. is</font>

249
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,510
number two and dear old abovenet numbers

250
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,490
three and<font color="#E5E5E5"> four and so on and so forth</font>

251
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,890
but although you notice that third

252
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,720
column the number of instances I've got

253
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,220
a hundred thousand coming in from China

254
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,430
net and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next set of numbers are</font>

255
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,920
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really low so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the others</font>

256
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,069
are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something but that China net</font>

257
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,750
backbone that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weird so I thought</font>

258
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,120
I'd look it up on I'd look it up on who

259
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,190
is and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the same and you do</font>

260
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,150
you know who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a panic net that address</font>

261
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:10,650
and it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> China Telecom china telecom</font>

262
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:14,640
have around 300,000 customers because

263
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:19,110
they're bloody huge so I go haha I will

264
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:21,480
do who is CN Nick CN you can do it too

265
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:25,860
and the result is one line out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

266
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,570
registry so it's mildly uninformative so

267
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,060
whatever's going on in Guangzhou

268
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,610
Province in China which is as good as I

269
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,880
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get with that address that's pretty</font>

270
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:39,120
weird because all of the victims of that

271
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,810
stalker live in other countries see kind

272
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">of thing what is this am I is this the</font>

273
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,300
Red Army gone feral is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> why why gear</font>

274
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,910
with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back door chip working</font>

275
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,069
overtime is this just you know the

276
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chinese branch of someone like Google</font>

277
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,030
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the various things you know its</font>

278
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,260
commercial espionage you know is this

279
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,329
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight up commercial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

280
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,670
collection or just a bloody good virus

281
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,890
all of those theories are probably

282
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,839
viable but let's see where we go with

283
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,779
this because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interested in</font>

284
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,480
looking at who are the stalker looking

285
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:17,250
at who are the victims so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

286
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,520
countries of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the victims and the amazing</font>

287
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:23,700
thing is that's almost every country on

288
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,350
the planet in other words this stalker

289
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,130
is sort of picking out victims from

290
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,590
everywhere

291
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,910
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> Senegal and you know a whole</font>

292
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of countries where you just</font>

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,150
wouldn't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

294
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,330
even reached until last week you know

295
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:38,280
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really bizarre why are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

296
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,370
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a complete list of countries</font>

00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,620
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i yes google ads are everywhere and</font>

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube's pretty cool too but you know</font>

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,160
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you more likely to be stalked if</font>

301
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,750
my absolute numbers if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you live in those</font>

302
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,050
countries you're more likely to be

306
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,390
absolutely and then I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> well maybe</font>

307
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,250
the ads are biasing a bit let's do this

308
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,800
relatively let's do this on a percentage

309
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,480
terms so in Macau three percent of the

310
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,329
time you're likely to be stalked by this

311

314

virus and an amazingly weird one this is

315
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,520
just weird crap so you kind of go what's

316
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,950
the timing of this particular stalker

317
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,819
how long does it take from the URL fetch

318
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,890
to the store the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average was 74 seconds</font>

319
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,740
but in reality almost everything happens

320
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:50,270
not in one second not in two seconds but

321
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:54,360
three seconds I don't know why three

322
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:56,370
tick tick tick tick three bang really

323
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,540
weird and and some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stalks happen</font>

324
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to day later you know it just takes</font>

325
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,790
forever but this is strong peak at three

326
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,590
seconds that didn't really help what

327
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,870
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those user agent strings because</font>

328
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,270
I'm collecting absolutely everything I'm

329
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:13,890
doing full packet capture the lot so

330
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:17,550
what's the stalker<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stalker is</font>

331
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:19,350
weirdly dull and stupid because they use

332
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,170
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every time in the same</font>

333
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,790
user agent string<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's maxthon so if</font>

334
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,130
this was an incredibly clever

335
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,099
state-based espionage effort they're

336
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:31,230
bloody stupid which you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably</font>

337
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,520
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good sign for government work you know</font>

338
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,840
i'm not going to discount that but it

339
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,360
does seem a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird that if you're</font>

340
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,470
doing this fantastic job at culling user

341
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">urls and stalking them</font>

342
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,430
you think you could cover your tracks a

343
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:47,290
bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that so you know okay</font>

344
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:51,520
what about the victims well you've got

345
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:56,230
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running windows mmm and the</font>

346
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:59,829
signatures look a lot like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chrome hmm</font>

347
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:03,130
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is weird so am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I seeing some kind</font>

348
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">of virus on windows in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chrome you'd like</font>

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think so well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe you wouldn't</font>

350
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,510
that's the wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> City to say that of</font>

351
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,160
course you wouldn't like to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

352
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:13,930
absolutely not no no no no no there's

353
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,150
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else in that user agent string</font>

354
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,880
that does start to give it away a bit

355
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:21,459
more back at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

356
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,800
very strange signature that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on most of</font>

357
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,690
the victims so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a user string</font>

358
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,109
that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a bit of chrome and I'm a</font>

359
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:33,340
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Safari weird and I've got this</font>

360
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:36,790
other bit that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only used by opinion</font>

361
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:40,060
Chinese language input port former

browser called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sogou explorer to point x</font>

363
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,560
and wikipedia has this to say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

364
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,480
you can look it up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's a</font>

365
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">little strange little quote at the back</font>

366
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,550
end there it uses cloud services to

367
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:57,310
filter out websites and consult where so

368
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:00,250
it does appear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case this is</font>

369
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:02,589
cloud mania most of the stalking that

370
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:05,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm saying isn't some fantastic piece of</font>

371
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,910
red army brilliance it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually just</font>

372
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,159
another instance of pretty crap cloud

373
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,500
mania and that what the users are doing

374
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">is loading on a chinese-language browser</font>

375
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,310
and then heading off and leaking all

376
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,010
their secrets so what someone in

377
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:22,750
Greenland is doing doing that beats me

378
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:24,280
with a stick there are some bigger

379
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,260
lessons about all this though which I

380
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,350
think it kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interesting and kind of</font>

381
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:32,170
disturbing one in 500 uses having a

382
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:35,889
stalker is a really lousy observation

383
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:38,500
about our<font color="#CCCCCC"> own expectations irrespective</font>

384
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:41,230
of whether you encrypt on the fly or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

385
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,420
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think all of us expect that the URLs</font>

386
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,000
we go to where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs we choose to go</font>

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,620
to and it's not posted up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> public for</font>

388
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,630
everyone else to look at observe and

389
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,429
laugh at it is meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

390
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,230
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does have some</font>

elements of prev

see and it just isn't happening that's a

393
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,740
big enough number to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried now a</font>

394
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,510
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is kind of self-inflicted</font>

395
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,070
it's just content casing or some other

396
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,440
kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's sort of on the wire</font>

397
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you then got to worry that there are</font>

398
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,580
these lists of URLs who gets to see them

399

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they sold does this become</font>

commercial data about users that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

traded using your identity without any

of your knowledge what conditions is

403
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:24,000
that kind of information bartered about

404
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:25,950
are we comfortable with that or any of

<font color="#E5E5E5">us even aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the rate is that high</font>

yesterday's this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a tiny</font>

408
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,320
glimpse that's only 69 million there are

409
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,080
two point three billion of us this

410
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,580
constant flow of information and you

411
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,949
kind of wonder who's wandering around

412
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,530
the exhaust pipe having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sniff at those</font>

413
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,390
digital fumes because my suspicion is

414
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,340
there are a lot more folk crowded around

415
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,860
your exhaust pipe than you ever dared to

416
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine what's happening in the larger</font>

418
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,390
tiny experiment of ads can uncover

419
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:03,150
something the larger world i think is

420
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,559
much much weirder than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that's</font>

where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got to thank you very much to</font>
