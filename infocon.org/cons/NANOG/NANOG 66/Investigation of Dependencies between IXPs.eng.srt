1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,559
your system failure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font>

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">leads into our next presentation because</font>

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,360
we got Daniel cop who is a researcher at

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,020
d kicks who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about those</font>

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:23,119
wonderful large IX systems and what

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:26,369
happens if they fail thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,369
quick thing that goes forward that goes

8
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:32,460
back and ignore<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other thank you and</font>

9
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,580
everybody to provide you some variety I

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,480
brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of tables after the many</font>

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,699
kitten pictures I'm with<font color="#E5E5E5"> D kicks in the</font>

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,980
research department and I would like to

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,620
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you something about disability</font>

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,550
maybe of their internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> core we don't</font>

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:55,050
know but we investigated when what

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,690
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a nice p might fail so in</font>

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,640
Europe you have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> many XPS and they</font>

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,559
have a lot of traffic for example of

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,519
activities we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> reached and frankford</font>

20
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,070
five terabytes per second lately and so

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,530
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the question how severe</font>

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,059
it might be if such an IXP fails and

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,189
what will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll go to whole internet down and</font>

25
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:21,979
everything is not reachable anymore so

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,840
when last year one major<font color="#E5E5E5"> ixp hadn't or</font>

27
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:26,939
plugged in loop into a network a lot of

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,880
traffic or drop that their platform and

29
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:34,158
we had a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into our and our platform</font>

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:38,158
what happened there so there was an cigs

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,740
that was the 13th of May at 12pm around

32
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,579
12pm they had 400 gigabit loop in the

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,589
network and like 500 to 600 sessions

34
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,229
dropped EGP sessions at that time and

35
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,770
you see here it's like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two day time</font>

36
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,259
span and at the event<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks like the</font>

37
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,470
traffic plummet to the to the bottom but

38
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,540
that's not true because they're they're

39
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,670
measuring software got affected also so

40
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,560
it just looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it got routed yeah to</font>

41
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bottom which is probably on too so</font>

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this at another stage and now</font>

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question was what will happen at d</font>

44
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,390
kicks now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had erased the part where</font>

45
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,140
red event was and also at this

46
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,869
aggregation level you

47
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,390
who were not able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the effects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,760
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UM sex outage at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DX platform</font>

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,069
because you had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a more detailed</font>

50
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,700
view because this one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-minute</font>

51
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:34,920
aggregated and so the question was will

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,630
the traffic rise that what we thought at

53
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,549
the first stage without yeah now we are

54
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,350
reaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> new traffic limit and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Heights</font>

55
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,970
and even more traffic EP and or will

56
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,220
they just stay the same because there's

57
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:53,670
no dependencies or will it even drop to

58
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:56,940
the bottom so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now an view of the</font>

59
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,920
time span<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had erased and what we saw</font>

60
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,060
and we were surprised was a drop in

61
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:07,200
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> about maybe like almost ten</font>

62
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,420
percent at that time and it happened in

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,970
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then after</font>

64
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,140
drew covered and yeah that was something

65
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,820
we didn't expect it so we got like the

66
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,369
task the research department got a task

67
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,540
to have more detailed<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into what</font>

68
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:28,170
happened here so the time span was like

69
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,870
that at one you can see where I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> zigs</font>

70
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,988
plucked a loop and at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time our</font>

71
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,230
traffic started to decrease and at the

72
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,810
point to you had the like 500 to 600

73
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:43,018
which piece of sessions drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> at am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zigs</font>

74
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:47,880
there was like almost our lowest level

75
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:50,430
of traffic and and then at three you can

76
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">see where I'm zigs just after seven</font>

77
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,400
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a loop and deactivated it</font>

78
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,220
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty fast and at that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,989
also our traffic started to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more</font>

80
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,510
healthy and back to a normal level which

81
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,040
was then at like four it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 20</font>

82
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,320
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the event it was fine</font>

83
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,480
again and it even<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

84
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:16,589
higher so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we asked ourselves what could</font>

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,988
be the cause to that and so far we found

86
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,539
three points which could be maybe

87
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:24,900
there's more but we have three now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

88
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:27,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one was remote peering routers so</font>

89
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,210
there was routers or there are routers

90
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,159
that are connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> both IXPs just one</font>

91
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,570
router so if

92
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,550
was a packet storm at<font color="#CCCCCC"> alexs with</font>

93
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">foreigner gigabit they got overloaded</font>

94
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,400
and so they also had no connectivity

95
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,859
kicks because this router was overloaded

96
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,330
this was we had a look into<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

97
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,910
customers were affected and how much

98
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:51,840
traffic this was a counter to of the

99
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,870
drop it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just 0.92 gigabit so not</font>

100
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,640
much but yeah still there's this effect

101
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,640
and we are pretty sure that this would

102
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,020
have them again then we had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second</font>

103
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,810
thing and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the most</font>

104
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,810
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and we are sure that we</font>

105
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,270
lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most traffic to this event and</font>

106
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,770
it's the ideas that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have or it's not</font>

107
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,270
an idea it's pretty sure that you have

108
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:16,020
added a symmetric routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Internet</font>

109
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,960
so one part towards the destination

110
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,820
travels<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I XP and the back way the</font>

111
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,500
return way goes of a nova<font color="#CCCCCC"> nutr for</font>

112
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,620
example it goes over m6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it returns</font>

113
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">or body kicks so if one XP fails there's</font>

114
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,050
no connection anymore till the point the

115
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,849
network converts again with bgp and so

116
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:41,340
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a more deep look into this</font>

117
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:43,140
event we we try to measure like the

118
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,289
isometric routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths or any parts</font>

119
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,090
between different IX<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece and a</font>

120
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,520
colleague of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> rode and rode and</font>

121
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,250
software for that to use the ripe ncc

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,930
probes and you have to measure the whole

123
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,060
thing so we also made a softer available

124
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,640
at github and yeah you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font>

125
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:05,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a mate recruiting parts we</font>

126
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:09,000
we chosen the probes that were connected

127
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,010
to both IXPs and that we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,030
problems during that event that day lost

129
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,219
traffic so we ended up with 250 guesses

130
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,190
which which were connected to both<font color="#E5E5E5"> IXPs</font>

131
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:23,970
and we know lost traffic and of this 50

132
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:26,700
we had thirty eight percent which had as

133
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,850
a metric routing paths and eight of them

134
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,560
didn't reverse any any IP but it was

135
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:37,800
just fifties or there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of more</font>

136
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:42,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">geeky of 700 + + +</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> @ d kicks and arms</font>

137
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:46,720
extended and 23 same is connected so

138
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,119
what we did next was we used a lot of

139
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,690
more measurement points and try to

140
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,100
measure it again independent of the

141
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,130
networks that lost traffic so we

142
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,830
measured everything and then we saw that

143
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,480
we had sixteen percent of Azamat

144
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,900
recruiting passed between a music sandy

145
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,760
kicks so this number is lower and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

146
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,609
number before was higher where we only

147
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,610
use the which drop traffic or lost

148
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,680
traffic or lost traffic at our platform

149
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:19,810
that we saw and so this also means that

150
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,920
when we selected at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the notes before the</font>

151
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,570
day more likely where or lost traffic to

152
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,270
that event to resume at recruiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths</font>

153
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:31,090
because afterwards we had just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mia less</font>

154
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:34,030
percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's also numbers for</font>

155
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,760
different connections between IXPs for

156
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,859
example we also have here in red details

157
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,469
and links and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> musics and links in</font>

158
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,440
green they are almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar d kicks</font>

159
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:51,160
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> music's have a bigger overlap yeah</font>

160
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:54,850
and to traffic details here are some pie

161
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,700
charts which show which a<font color="#E5E5E5"> esas lost</font>

162
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,340
traffic or lost the most traffic so this

163
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the parts of the lost traffic which</font>

164
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,570
is accounted to which a SS but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

165
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,210
see a as numbers here the numbers are

166
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:10,240
megabit so you can see for the sauce is

167
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:13,030
of course it was the most other IXPs

168
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:19,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">divide different networks different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> age</font>

169
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:21,460
ends which had 65 gigabits and you can

170
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,560
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that content provided by mouth</font>

171
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,460
of the south side<font color="#E5E5E5"> and destination where</font>

172
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:31,090
more eyeballs which probably is the

173
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,090
usual traffic exchange deny XP so I

174
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:36,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that would say that there was no</font>

175
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:39,760
special occasion or<font color="#CCCCCC"> specialized and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

176
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:44,980
lost to a Miss configuration a lot of

177
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:49,060
traffic yeah and a third point which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

178
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:51,160
yeah more a guess is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> also user just</font>

179
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,500
went away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from there like the no</font>

180
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,560
internet connection was disconnected or

181
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,180
there was no it was

182
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,420
nothing anymore they just went away got

183
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,770
some coffee or anything and and this I

184
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,000
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a pretty good point because</font>

185
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:06,620
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have a look at the traffic</font>

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,990
timeline at ixp you can also see that

187
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,170
the peaks are during the time when

188
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are at their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pc so this could</font>

189
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,550
also be a big point because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's traffic</font>

190
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,650
is user driven and what if they do

191
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:23,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">something different yeah it just is less</font>

192
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:25,730
traffic to exchange and then also coming

193
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,449
to other results<font color="#CCCCCC"> Emil from ripe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NCC</font>

194
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:32,210
provided us with with some statistics

195
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,550
you can also see it at his blog post and

196
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:39,620
this one is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more detailed</font>

197
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:44,089
view of the event<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he was using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

198
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:46,160
probes that traversed Rancic's at that

199
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,750
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the event</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see in the</font>

200
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,120
beginning it was green so that means

201
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,520
everything was fine it was traversing a

202
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">music's there was no lost packets in the</font>

203
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,710
trace rods then starting with the event

204
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,390
you can see orange which means the

205
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:03,050
infrastructure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> unzips was not seen</font>

206
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:05,990
and trace or failed so this was this

207
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:09,109
accounts to Los traffic the blue you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

208
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,450
see as is if it did a routing path

209
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,310
changed and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> traversed another another</font>

210
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,880
another is ends during that time which

211
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,290
were not located at<font color="#E5E5E5"> amex so it could be</font>

212
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,450
transit providers or it could also be

213
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decrease infrastructure any other XP</font>

214
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:26,690
and you can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that still some</font>

215
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,400
trace roads we are getting through which

216
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,390
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're not all traffic</font>

217
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:35,150
was dropped<font color="#E5E5E5"> at unzips and also point is</font>

218
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,010
that afterwards I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

219
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,589
conversion again which goes not

220
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:47,240
completely to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state like before and</font>

221
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:50,540
yeah so coming to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a summary we found</font>

222
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:54,740
three reasons for XP dependencies which

223
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:56,870
is remote peering so this can show how

224
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,500
maybe not to design remote peering in

225
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:04,459
the future and<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevent such events for</font>

226
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:07,100
traffic laws and also saw the asthmatic

227
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:08,520
routing past which i think is a good

228
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,850
starting point to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

229
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,960
more detailed view into how how the

230
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:17,100
paths are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the network and</font>

231
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,100
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what might happen</font>

232
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,740
more if it's a good thing and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

233
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,320
saw the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight thing where user</font>

234
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,650
maybe went away from their<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

235
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,110
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really bad</font>

236
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:34,590
happened the internet was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stable</font>

237
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:37,050
and probably only<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small portion was</font>

238
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:40,560
affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by this event and this may be</font>

239
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:43,500
supports discussions about how sensitive

240
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:48,560
XPS might be and if you have to regulate

241
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:50,970
more or anything and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

242
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,790
looking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> details and thinking about</font>

243
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the event might give some improvements</font>

244
00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:00,000
to protocols like bgp or maybe have new

245
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:03,330
protocols like like<font color="#E5E5E5"> BFD in future which</font>

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,020
are we are working on yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sums up</font>

247
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:08,250
my presentation was<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty fast so I</font>

248
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of time for</font>

249
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,720
questions thank you very much

250
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:27,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Phillip Matthews from Nokia I just</font>

251
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:30,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">curious when the amex how ditch happened</font>

252
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,310
why didn't bgp sessions go down and they

253
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,750
just rerouted around it can you explain

254
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,630
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more maybe what actually</font>

255
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,640
happened there<font color="#CCCCCC"> why did didn't or yeah</font>

256
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,910
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds from what you said if</font>

257
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">I understand correctly that it the you</font>

258
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,510
know traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not rerouted around it</font>

259
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would have expected you know bgp</font>

260
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,900
withdrawals stuff happened and then

261
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,600
they've suddenly say oh I can reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

262
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,740
via md kicks instead so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic</font>

263
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,450
would have gone that way and you would

264
00:12:53,740 --> 00:13:03,900
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually seen a spike rather than a</font>

265
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:07,120
fall yeah going back to amuse statistic

266
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:10,630
the blue lines show that traffic was

267
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,000
rerouted so so what happened here it was

268
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:16,450
rerouted and only the orange<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff was</font>

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,390
was robbed so rerouting a court but of

270
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,820
course after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout so I took</font>

271
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:25,540
some while like like three minutes to

272
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:28,090
have bgp to take new parts to the

273
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,010
network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the traffic we didn't</font>

274
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,220
see the traffic at our platform so we

275
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:35,530
still had some loss which accounted

276
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,650
probably to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the automatic routing past</font>

277
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:42,400
and utter like the user behavior and

278
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:44,470
start again pardon me but wouldn't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

279
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">symmetric routing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would think that</font>

280
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,910
would have had more stuff because if

281
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:51,480
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were turn path used to be safe say</font>

282
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,819
the return path used to be through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a MX</font>

283
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,620
then that pass should have been down it

284
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,890
should so it should have switched over

285
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,350
maybe to your path yeah didn't switch

286
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:06,220
over to our place that's what we were

287
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:08,860

288
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,870
your policies are maybe you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

289
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,540
switch over to transit providers or

290
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:16,360
anything but yeah we don't feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

291
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,980
got the traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was and it's also</font>

292
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">questioned how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much traffic was lost a</font>

293
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,740
ton<font color="#CCCCCC"> zigs because it was probably not</font>

294
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,959
everything it was just a portion but

295
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,700
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably some some points in</font>

296
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,090
internet that got more traffic to that

297

hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cues limelight networks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I used</font>

299
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:44,200
to run a large exchange in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the UK</font>

300
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,270
about five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

301
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:51,940
story and it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's quite</font>

302
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:55,990
that's quite related there was a similar

303
00:14:51,940 --> 00:15:01,870
issue seen in the mid-2000s in London

304
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:03,520
and a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of Reuters started to</font>

305
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,110
lose sessions and couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really work</font>

306
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,939
out why and what it was was one of the

307
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,100
multiple exchanges that was operating in

308
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,880
London at the time I'd had a network

309
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,670
incident and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that were</font>

310
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,100
connected to that also<font color="#CCCCCC"> then started to</font>

311
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">see their sessions died on the other</font>

312
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,350
exchanges in London<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was like well</font>

313
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,750
why are we seeing these issues white

314
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:28,330
wire the pier these piers going down on

315
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,390
our exchange even though our exchange is

316
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,200
finding his up and is running<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

317
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:35,170
exactly what you've seen here the

318
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is is that a small number of</font>

319
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,310
Reuters and this is made worse by

320
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:43,150
distance peering a small number of

321
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:46,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">routers are peering with the same AS the</font>

322
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:49,120
same neighbor a esas in multiple places

323
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,190
over distance peering so that they may

324
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,290
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or 4p rings in the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Metro</font>

325
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:57,340
with that is but then they may have

326
00:15:53,290 --> 00:16:00,069
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 5 6 with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same is with the</font>

327
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,500
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rooter from the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AS over</font>

328
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,750
distance<font color="#CCCCCC"> peering so suddenly this one</font>

329
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:09,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ruther has got like 10 sessions with the</font>

330
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:11,950
same neighbor what we saw was<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite</font>

331
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,980
large devices that were just not keeping

332
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:17,230
up and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> losing the bgp sessions</font>

333
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:21,070
yeah something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that appeared to be</font>

334
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:23,110
underpowered was stable and was up but

335
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,520
the secret was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't connected to</font>

336
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,830
any distance peering<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it wasn't</font>

337
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,350
connected to multiple exchange points

338
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,030
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only connected to one or two so</font>

339
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,280
is the situation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those Reuters are</font>

340
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:36,250
being overburdened and what it is is bgp

341
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,930
multipathing happening here so you lose

342
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,550
an interface or something bad happens

343
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,959
when you lose a neighbor so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

344
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">that neighbors gone away I need to</font>

345
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,050
process all the withdrawal so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go</font>

346
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,880
and process all the withdrawals for that

347
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,510
his menu converge<font color="#E5E5E5"> bet</font>

348
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,280
paths and oh the best path the neighbor

349
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,960
for that best path has gone away let's

350
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,089
go and compute some more withdrawals and

351
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,010
more stuff eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP state</font>

352

353
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,780
hellos and the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just goes</font>

354
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:04,030
into a spiraling fail and that's what's

355
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,879
been built here is you know there you go

356
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:11,410
fifty percent not working fifty percent

357
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:21,459
sack of fail caused by people building

358
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:23,530
cheap networks and cheap peering Jeff

359
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:27,730
Houston AP Nick I think you're being a

360
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:29,320
bit harsh on<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mike but an actual fact</font>

361
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was really the reason why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i got up</font>

362
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this microphone because you're</font>

363
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:37,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of saying i observed this issue and</font>

364
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:41,110
down here at layer 2 I saw this traffic

365
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:44,260
and using this trace route tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried</font>

366
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:47,530
to intuit some behavior but you didn't

367
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,720
mention what happened to routing do you

368
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,610
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> even monitor routing because I</font>

369
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,130
would have thought that sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-half</font>

370
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:57,189
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> even two thirds of this story is</font>

371
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,620
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a story about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GP and the</font>

372
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,550
real issue is as Mike was trying to say

373
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:06,310
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened at am sex to the folk who</font>

374
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:09,129
are doing bgp across that exchange and

375
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:11,530
what did they<font color="#CCCCCC"> see and what happened at</font>

376
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,540
de kicks why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you not see more</font>

377
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:18,129
traffic and not less is really a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

378
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:22,240
question so do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys collect bgp do</font>

379
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:24,610
you guys analyze bgp you know where's

380
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other part of this story yeah there</font>

381
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,679
will be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic repentance is number</font>

382
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,420
two presentation sometime hopefully but

383
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,180
you do collect the GPU like you're

384
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,190
actually you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually got this stuff</font>

385
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:39,070
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think so but we didn't look into</font>

386
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:43,410
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> till now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's some effort</font>

387
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,409
going on thank you

388
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:57,149
Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Daniel I'm sorry Stefan</font>

389
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,950
containing hi I'm wondering I know you

390
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,100
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are organized in your Ike's where</font>

391
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:04,290
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ixp guys are organized and have</font>

392
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,090
you discussed it yikes for example what

393
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,340
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the traffic graphs of e cakes</font>

394
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,030
what about B cakes for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for</font>

395
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:18,090
a German<font color="#E5E5E5"> region the traffic has to be</font>

396
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:20,668
somewhere so yeah yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's also</font>

397
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,040
hard with statistics sometimes it always

398
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:25,380
depends how long you preserve them and

399
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,450
into which granularity and everything

400
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,150
but I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was discussed that</font>

401
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are eggs I was not there there was</font>

402
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:37,559
also a presentation like this a try and

403
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:39,418
other occasions yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you yeah</font>

404
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:43,049
but we will keep continue to look into

405
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:50,460
this and have similar investigations in

406
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:52,830
the future all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all right</font>
