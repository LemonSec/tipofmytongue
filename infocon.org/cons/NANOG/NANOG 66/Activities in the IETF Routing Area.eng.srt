00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,280
hi I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ali Atlas and I'm here to well</font>

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,970
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little bit about what's been</font>

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,119
going on in routing in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF so first</font>

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,119
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover a few sort of general</font>

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,490
area wide themes some of these have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,220
going on for quite some time and so

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,229
shouldn't be real surprises yang

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,729
modeling but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting to the point</font>

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it makes sense to really start</font>

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,468
paying attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> data plan</font>

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,839
encapsulations lots of different ones

12
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,070
coming in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data centers</font>

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,410
centralized orchestration and what does

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean as we develop new technologies</font>

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,699
for control plane and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,290
about a couple of the new working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font>

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,649
that have been formed this past year

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:57,420
beer and get net so first yang models

19
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,280
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of really good</font>

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,219

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,769
operators open configs been very active

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,330
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this space and help in drive what</font>

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:11,298
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the models for</font>

24
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,500
configuration and read state analytics I

25
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,540
find when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to operators there's</font>

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,380
usually a high interest in this because

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,350
it's is coming for how you're going to

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,600
be operating and interacting with the

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,179
routers this is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good chance to</font>

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,059
shape and improve what the common<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,280
configuration is I have a lot of the

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,360
routing area working groups working on

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,610
yang models for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their specific</font>

35
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,780
focused design teams if you haven't

36
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,729
taken a look at any of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got a</font>

37
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,310

38
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,009

<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP model all of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are quite mature</font>

40
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,689
and worth looking at I can't click on

41
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,850
them here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go to the</font>

43
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,298
directly to the drafts to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

44
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,700
there's also challenges of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

45
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,409
doing yang models because unlike<font color="#CCCCCC"> mibs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,000

47
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,560
technology we're going back and trying

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do yang models for a wide array of</font>

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology simultaneously and having</font>

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,310
them you know work together and so on so

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's all sorts of issues ranging from</font>

52
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,930
depending on

53
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,460
what the device is where it sits to the

54
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,430
network what kind of a network it sits

55
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,220
on it needs a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of models it</font>

56
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,890
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to do some models</font>

57
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,480
that work for different<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices and yet</font>

58
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,570
not all of the models at a particular

59
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,549
device actually needs so getting the

60
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:40,720
input on which models are important is

61
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,940
very useful common abstractions trivial

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,670
case right router ID do your model as a

63
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,859
u int32<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and model</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it with dot dotted</font>

64
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,109
quad what's a common convention if we

65
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,300
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the trivialities then</font>

66
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,220
you end up with unnecessary divergence

67
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,110
and so one of the tricks here is trying

68
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to avoid that unnecessary divergence and</font>

69
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,700
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally there are questions how do</font>

70
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,130
we drive the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right abstractions there's</font>

71
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,220
at least three different views coming

72
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">into play one of them which i think is</font>

73
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important to bring into this and</font>

74
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,140
have there is the operator of you how

75
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you planning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on using the models</font>

76
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,519
what are the abstractions how do you

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,560
view what needs to be there in yang

78
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,630
models and for the configuration so

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,130
having that perspective another

80
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,440
perspective of course is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

81
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">vendors what are the implementations and</font>

82
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:33,100
then there's a natural tendency in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

83
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,049
IETF to do it by working group so here

84
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,230
this is a hammer let me describe a yang

85
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,420
model for the hammer as opposed to

86
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:47,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">describing it for how you're using the</font>

87
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:49,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">hammer right um I feel like the internal</font>

88
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,220
or internal organization of the IETF is

89
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,810
completely the least way that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

90
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually structure the yang models we</font>

91
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,130
want to do them based on operator

92
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,720
perspectives and we can do cross working

93
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,950
group and that's what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing with</font>

94
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,109
for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic engineering</font>

95
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,959
model but we need your perspective

96
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,980
coming in and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting some of it</font>

97
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,049
but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love having good reviews</font>

98
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,780
so classifying models we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

99
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:16,840
models but the mother<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data models</font>

100
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,180
they're all at different layers so at

101
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,310
the highest layer not in routing but in

102
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,620
ops and management there's work going on

103
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,289
on a service model how do you do a layer

104
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">three VPN this is more towards a</font>

105
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:31,900
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> element models so some</font>

106
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,139
focused on configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

107
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,400
more

108
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,949
because that's one of the new pieces

109
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,669
that yang brings but all sort order ting

110
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,169
the network also dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap is because</font>

111
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:44,349
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interest in</font>

112
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:47,198
programmatic<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do you have good</font>

113
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:50,889
interactions into the routers so again

114
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,960
here are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some links to drafts where</font>

115
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:56,199
there's fairly significant work

116
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,029
progressing onto apology generic

117
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,389
topology layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 layer 3 traffic</font>

118
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:04,360
engineering rib so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

119
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,639
install I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe it as static</font>

120
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,009
routes on steroids take all of the

121
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,219
abstractions that you have and take

122
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:13,810
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them have the ability you</font>

123
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:16,689
know take a look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rib model it's</font>

124
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,659
got some really cool stuff then how do

125
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:21,580
these all interconnect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how do we</font>

126
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:22,990
make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have model a</font>

that's developed over here by this group

and model be over there and they both

129
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,930
happen to need the same set of three

130
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,560
parameters for instance you get end up

131
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,150
with common groupings instead of slight

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,370
differences so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of the</font>

133
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,888
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenges and one of the reasons that</font>

134
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,839
we need people coming in looking at the

135
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,129
models from a how am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I going to use this</font>

136
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:46,150
how's it going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look on my routers</font>

137
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:48,189
type of perspective coordination<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm quite concerned about so</font>

140
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:54,399
we've got a mailing list which anyone

141
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:56,860
can join of course which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically</font>

142
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,050
for folks who are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in talking</font>

143
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,909
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and coordinating but about the</font>

144
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,439
different yang models related to routing

145
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:04,810

00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:15,699
for almost a year now looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:21,610
the models interconnect what are gaps

153
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,948
potentially in the yang language or in

154
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,550
our expressiveness that we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

155
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,349
in order to do this and make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

156
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,240
we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the routing area working</font>

157
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,770
group that's of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around for a</font>

158
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,289
while it's doing all sorts of stuff one

159
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,020
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's good for also is</font>

160
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:39,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">being a forum for routing related yang</font>

161
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,799
models and you can see a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

162
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,300
that are down<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that don't quite fit</font>

163
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,219
into any of the other working groups and

164
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,340
yet we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a common place to talk about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">them</font>

so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jang modeling it's been going</font>

167
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,780
extremely heavy I mean we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

168
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:58,720
well over a hundred yang models being

169
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,719
worked on simultaneously across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF</font>

170
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,970
and a large number are in routing so

171
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,010
that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on quite heavily for</font>

172
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:10,240
the last year and a half at least and

173
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,430
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot of those models</font>

174
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,950
are mature enough to take some good

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:20,800
solid looks at so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me go on to data</font>

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:23,469

177
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing more overlay networks lots</font>

looking at what's in its in caps are

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,130
going to be there's always motivations

187
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,140
for a new data plan encapsulation and

188
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,600
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always look really simple to get</font>

189
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:53,140

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">this little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of extra data and then</font>

191
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,370
you start getting into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the complexities</font>

192
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,590
how much flexibilities you have oh but

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,570
if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it for this particular use</font>

194
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,419
case then I can take advantage of this

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hardware feature and so on or maybe I</font>

196
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,380
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this encapsulation but I've</font>

197
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,730
got to ship it over across I don't know

198
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,740
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be firewalls I'm going</font>

199
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it across UDP I have to worry</font>

200
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,910
about entropy and so on what each of

201
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,610
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different data plan encapsulations</font>

202
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:21,010
mean is that you end up with isolated

203
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,830
ecosystems where you have to translate

204
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:26,020
between the different encapsulations if

205
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,180
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk and to some extent</font>

206
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,039
that's fine if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data center</font>

207
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:35,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your network and you pick</font>

208
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,880
encapsulation a that's great but once

209
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,829
people have actually taken these

210
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,610
different data plan in caps and deployed

211
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:44,470
them getting to consensus and changing

212
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,460
any of them is a little on the

213
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,110
challenging side and we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

214
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,990
new encapsulations you're adding

215
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:55,720
hardware costs and delay on the other

216
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,940
hand if its proprietary sometimes you

217
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,990
can take really great advantage of some

218
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,790
of the hardware aspect

219
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,920
see number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposals around you know</font>

220
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,540
taking advantage of TCP offload hey we

221
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,149
could take advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this get some</font>

222
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:10,510
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good functionality but then</font>

223
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:13,420
you're locked in so one of the questions

224
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:16,480
that we have here is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many different</font>

225
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,149
data plan encapsulations so if you look

226
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,010
here on the right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not sorry yeah</font>

227
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">right I'm not going to bother to read to</font>

228
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:27,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you the full list of them you can look</font>

229
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">at them those are just the obvious types</font>

230
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,719
of considerations that you have to

231
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:35,079
question when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start doing a new data</font>

232
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,620
plan whether it's your your entropy<font color="#E5E5E5"> MTU</font>

233
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,850
considerations header protection how

234
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,670
what happens if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have</font>

235
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,380
multiple layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these you have to</font>

236
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about all of these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

237
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,980
start simple I could take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

238
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,140
this feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to ship this extra</font>

239
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,730
information around and then it starts

240
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:57,520
getting complicated so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font>

241
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:00,339
to do is seek commonality i chartered a

242
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,500
design team that worked last year to

243
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:05,709
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with the list of factors to</font>

244
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,380
consider and basically to encourage

245
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:12,040
common solutions when there isn't a

246
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,829
reason to have different ones because

247
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,689
usually the reason to have a different

248
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:18,579
encapsulation has absolutely nothing to

249
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,459
do with congestion considerations or

250
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:23,859
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those aren't your motivations</font>

251
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:27,189
for a new data plan encapsulation so if

252
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:30,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can succeed in keeping commonality in</font>

253
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">the data plan in caps when we when</font>

254
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,079
there's not a strong reason for them to

255
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:38,529
be different again discourage divergence

256
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:40,979
if we don't have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it then maybe</font>

257
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:43,390
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take shape and take care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

258
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,160
but one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that's happening</font>

259
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,689
here is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these data plane</font>

260
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,589
encapsulations that are coming are

261
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,060
coming into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF already being out</font>

262
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,690
in the marketplace already being

263
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:58,089
deployed with a load of isolated

264
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,690
ecosystems that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it hard to</font>

265
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:04,990
look at and maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe you</font>

266
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,040
all are happy having a selection but

267
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,190
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that because</font>

268
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,689
usually I mean I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all joke that</font>

269
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing about standards is there</font>

270
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,030
so many but

271
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,819
we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to have a vast number that do</font>

272
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:22,089
the same thing so how many do we need

273
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:24,670
for different purposes for different

274
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,830
transports for different environments

275
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,229
when we say hardware friendly what do we

276
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,150
mean turns out hardware friendly is very

277
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,980
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're thinking about TCP</font>

278
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:37,240
offload versus what about core router

279
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:39,010
can do understanding that many routers

280
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,260
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance only have access to so many</font>

again the motivations for all of these

bit centralized orchestration obviously

295
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,150
there's been an industry movement toward

296
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,770
software-defined networks having a lot

from an Orchestrator and you're done

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,810
maybe you needed slightly more api's

with netcong from rest conf or you can

319
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,860
do it with a specific protocol do we

320
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,540
continue to just reuse the existing

321
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:24,010
protocols and develop those in parallel

322
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,498
I've got at least two working groups you

324
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:30,609
starting to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what makes sense</font>

325
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:32,289
to go do in the control plane and this

326
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:34,119
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being driven by how you're building</font>

your data centers and what makes sense

00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:39,429
to you so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the themes</font>

330
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:43,929
impacting what's happening in a number

331
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:45,728
of the working groups in the IETF in

332
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:47,379
routing now let me tell you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

333
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:50,309
couple fun working groups that have

334
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:54,009
gotten started the first ones beer and

335
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:56,559
beer is just sorry it's just neat

336
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:59,189
technology it's the first multicast

337
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,839
packet encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've seen</font>

338
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:04,118
multicast specific you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use it for</font>

339
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,389
interesting things as targeted initially

340
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:11,589
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> em VPN ideas to remove multicast</font>

341
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:13,509
state and control state from the core of

342
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:18,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network but you can also think about</font>

343
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:20,829
what could you do if your network didn't

344
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:23,979
have to care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about massive scale</font>

345
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:27,699
application layer multicast where could

346
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:29,949
you go with it of course it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

347
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:32,889
neat and it requires hardware changes or

348
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:34,569
software implementation so at the moment

349
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:36,899
the works going ahead experimental

350
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:39,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of open questions</font>

351
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:43,689
you know does it actually simplify your

352
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:47,109
operations are there is it useful enough

353
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:49,358
to deploy is are the gains for it worth

354
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:52,149
it can we get past the challenges so

355
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:55,239
that it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful let me tell you</font>

356
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:57,789
the basic idea you take all of your edge

357
00:14:55,239 --> 00:15:00,729
routers and each of your edge routers

358
00:14:57,789 --> 00:15:02,919
gets assigned a bit in a bitmap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and each</font>

359
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:05,889
packet carries a bit string which

360
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:08,289
corresponds to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge routers that are</font>

361
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:09,939
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the packet you may say</font>

362
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:11,439
oh but I've got a lot of edge routers

363
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:13,738
yes so then you can do a trade off

364
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:17,259
between ingress replication and

365
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:19,809
duplication in the core it depends upon

366
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:21,639
how long your bit string is think of a

367
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:25,749
default as I think they're talking 256

368
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:28,119
bits fine so each hop you look at the

369
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:31,929
bit string and you look at a new

370
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:32,859
forwarding table called a Biff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll</font>

371
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:36,069
show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that looks like on the</font>

372
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:37,720
next page and replicate out to each of

373
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:40,360
the neighbors based up to the necessary

374
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">neighbors based on the biffed so nope</font>

375
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,370
free or tunnel multicast state the

376
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,620
biffed is forwarded based on your

377
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,230
shortest path to those particular

378
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,829
destinations so you're not dealing with

379
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:58,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">reverse forwarding state and so on</font>

380
00:15:52,829 --> 00:16:01,899
here's an example in this case you can

381
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:06,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">see the a bit span assign you d is 1 f</font>

382
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:08,470
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to e is 3a is for and B wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to send</font>

383
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:13,269
traffic and so for instance if B wants

384
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:15,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to send traffic to D and F in a B is</font>

385
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:18,760
going to look at it's a bit index

386
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,890
forwarding table it'll say oh I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

387
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">send I'm going to look at the first bit</font>

388
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,519
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is d great i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send it</font>

389
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,790
off to my neighbors see and that's going

390
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:32,709
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of also sending it to f so</font>

391
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,880
now i only want to send it to a so then

392
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:36,189
that's the height that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only bit</font>

393
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,570
that's left set<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll go off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

394
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ship it directly to a so you</font>

395
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,950
duplicate it obviously there's this

396
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,769
lovely architecture that talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

397
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,089
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in detail don't you know for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

398
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:48,430
the details you can get there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

399
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:52,480
the basic idea take a bitmap assign

400
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:57,459
routers do a lookup and this goes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

401
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:00,820
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the details on how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font>

402
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:03,369
packet forwarding what this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

403
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,990
worst case number of replications a

404
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,089
router has to do is based on the number

405
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:11,859
of neighbors it has as opposed to the

406
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:16,480
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bits and and it works right so</font>

407
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:18,819
the questions are not around the core of

408
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,520
this technology the in terms of

409
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:24,309
functionality the questions are is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

410
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,410
deployable what you need it for in a

<font color="#CCCCCC">way for multicast what are the uses is</font>

413
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:35,049
it worth changing your hardware to do

414
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,240
this for some networks for some data

415
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:39,750
centers it may be for other certainly

416
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,220

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,730
two now we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do mixture of layer 2</font>

433
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,830
and layer 3 you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have deterministic flows</font>

434
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,720
and when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> say flows I also mean</font>

435
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:31,600
multicast flows they care about unicast

436
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,300
as well as multicast very much as you

437
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,000
can imagine for audio-visual and the

438
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:41,379
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is to have a way of doing</font>

439
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">reserved paths and guaranteed low</font>

440
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,840

441
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:50,139
solving the problem with overcapacity in

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,709
this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually might have more</font>

443

444
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,940
more the fifty purse of the capacity

445
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:01,000
being these types of traffic flows so

446
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,250
you know you can set up the paths you

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it determent rly orchestrated you</font>

448
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:09,700
can do it in a distributed fashion using

449
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,470
for instance rsvp-te and then you have

450
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about knowing enough on the</font>

course maybe you've dscp to identify the

460
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,980
have you end up with tracks for which

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,960
describe how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much resources and</font>

462
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,450

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,720
into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well you can use a path</font>

00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,919
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need additional information beyond</font>

architecture its<font color="#E5E5E5"> preliminary it's not</font>

470
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:05,410
even yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> a working group draft i believe</font>

471
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,770
is giving a few techniques that already

472
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,840
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> layer to network</font>

473
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:17,310
so they're getting started obviously

474
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:20,260
this is targeted at particular focus but

475
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:25,990
some interesting work and building on a

476
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:27,490
lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf technologies so those</font>

477
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">are a couple new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups now let</font>

478
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:34,270
me talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about improving</font>

479
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:36,190
IETF work because as we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know doing</font>

480
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:41,230
open standards the first thing you hear

481
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:43,750
is it takes time it feels slow part of

482
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's because its stability when you're</font>

483
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,190
building a foundation or a staircase

484
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,450
people want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

485
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to have to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back and rip</font>

486
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:55,680
it out later and so there's that impact

487
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,340
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course it's volunteers and</font>

488
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,440
volunteers with different<font color="#E5E5E5"> prior</font>

489
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">competing priorities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

490
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when there's a crunch it's the day</font>

491
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,830
job that wins that's life then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

492
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,930
there's also consensus and getting to

493
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,030
consensus takes time I'm sure you're all

494
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">familiar with a challenge of say trying</font>

495

<font color="#E5E5E5">to go out to dinner with a group of say</font>

496
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,480
five or six people no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one wants to</font>

497
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:22,840
offend each other everyone has a small

498
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,280
opinion but not a strong one and it just

499
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,360
takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to figure out where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

500
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,910
going sometimes some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF process</font>

501
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,429
feels like that everyone has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

502
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit of an opinion and it just takes time</font>

503
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:40,480
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to that consensus been</font>

504
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:44,770
encouraging very much one of the reasons

505
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do consensus right is to make sure</font>

506
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we don't miss legitimate technical</font>

507
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,010
concerns and issues people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come with</font>

508
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">have different ways they're going to use</font>

509
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:56,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technology different concerns anyway</font>

510
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:02,020
but the key point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'd like you to</font>

511
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:05,350
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> away is that if you as operators</font>

512
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,139
really want some technology it can move

513
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we have you know it can go quickly</font>

514
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,750
we have an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> with bfg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over lag i</font>

515
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,910
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was less than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a year to go from</font>

516
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,070
here we really need this to multiple

517
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:20,620
interoperable implementations and out

518
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,689
the door so

519
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,809
what happens here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is operators end up</font>

520
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:28,960
being a useful forcing function for this

521
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:30,340
is what's needed I've of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

522
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,910
working on improvements particular in

523
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,379
the routing area encouraging conference

524
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,150
calls basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> for working group so we</font>

525
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,460
get that<font color="#CCCCCC"> high bandwidth communication</font>

526
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:42,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and resolve issues things don't</font>

527
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,870
stall out we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all familiar with oh yes</font>

528
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,370
we'll get around to talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

529
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">next IETF trying to make those</font>

530
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,469
conversations happen sooner whether it's

531
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,929
on the list or in virtual interims keep

532
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:57,160
the momentum going been doing training

533
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:59,170
to coordinate across the area and to get

534
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,380
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group chairs on similar pages</font>

535
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,970
and think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we're running the</font>

536
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,309
area<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> particular working groups</font>

537
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,670
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all up on YouTube also for</font>

538
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:11,320
anyone who's truly fascinated and

539
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:14,320
finally we can move drafts through the

540
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:17,590
process quickly the biggest factor with

541
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,360
moving drafts is responsive authors it's

542
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,300
not prot the process we're moving drafts

543
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,550
anyhow the issues tends to be there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

544
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:29,080
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some reasons pieces are slow</font>

545
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:31,870
or can be slow but much of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we</font>

546
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:37,090
can get stuff done when it's clear that

547
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:40,209
it's needed so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standard of</font>

548
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:42,040
course you know why should you come be

549
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,390
involved in the IETF if you're not

550
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,620
already and for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who are</font>

551
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:49,690
that's awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first reason I</font>

552
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:52,030
like to say is well you understand your

553
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:55,420
networks and what your needs are a lot

554
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:58,059
better than your vendors and if you

555
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:02,559
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up to your vendors to represent</font>

556
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:04,530
your thoughts in the IETF well you know

557
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're proxying multiple people and</font>

558
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,910
they have their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinions too but you</font>

559
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what your network needs and if that</font>

560
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">communication doesn't get through it's</font>

561
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,929
not always clear with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Technic what</font>

562
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,990
the right technology solution is so you

563
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:21,700
know your networks a lot better it gives

564
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,980
you a chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an impact and make</font>

565
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,740
the internet work better you really can

566
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,610
come in read a draft send a review and

567
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:32,679
make an impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it fix a problem</font>

568
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:35,189
when you come in with a good perspective

569
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,809
it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a lot of time</font>

570
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">another reason isn't it nice to find</font>

571
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:42,549
problems when they're still in the draft

573
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:50,139
have to sorry I mean let's let's be

574
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,909
honest here if you read the draft you

575
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:53,590
might pick up on something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't match up with your operational</font>

577
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,749
or deployable reality or we look at you

578
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:01,389
say they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about this</font>

topology this topology always causes

580
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:07,119
problems let's fix it you can fix it in

581
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:09,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">the draft before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's implemented before</font>

582
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,709
it's deployed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

583
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,690
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> workarounds I'd like to claim</font>

584
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,240
we have the technology perfect but no

585
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,669
one does so and then the other pieces as

586
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said operators serve a forcing</font>

587
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:23,379
function in the IETF you say what's

588
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:28,168
needed what's useful what's deployable

589
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:30,490
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do this</font>

590
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:34,049
describing it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> gap filling is a little</font>

591
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:36,639
harsh but nonetheless when you have an

592
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:39,039
operator or multiple operators coming in

593
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:43,658
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a real use case and I</font>

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,840
first thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't have to take a</font>

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all know people</font>

598
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,759
who have spent a lot of time during IETF

599
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:03,610
stuff and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that happens to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

600
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:06,850
our choice it's not the only choice and

601
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:09,219
it's not what's needed what's needed is

602
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,019
people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are operators who are doing</font>

603

their day jobs who are running<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:15,519
networks who nonetheless can spend a

605
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,379
little time to read an interesting

working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group draft and you know what if</font>

00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:21,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not interesting to you don't</font>

608
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,399
comment on it because we want what you

609
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:28,360
choose to review what you choose to

610

comment on has an impact and<font color="#CCCCCC"> phils gives</font>

611
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,979
an indication of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how useful that draft</font>

612
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:35,769
is ok you can join a relevant working

613
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,269
group list listen comment maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

614
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:39,730
don't read it every day every week every

615
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:41,649
month when you do you get some

616
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:45,400
perspective you don't have to read it

617
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:48,189
all another piece

618
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,800
way come to conferences you always joke

619
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,930
what a small world it is all the people

620
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,669
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah I saw you this</font>

621
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,710
conference you find out that your

622
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:59,020
friends are friends of friends no

623
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:02,050
problem it's the same way into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF</font>

624
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,960
community I'd be stunned if all of you

625
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:07,480
don't know at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who knows</font>

626
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,610
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's active in the IETF and who</font>

627
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,280
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to help you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out this</font>

628
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:14,620
isn't a strange for an organization or

629
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:17,379
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get involved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in and if it feels</font>

630
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:24,729
that way you know me now I'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on bgp flow spec one question is</font>

633
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,940
should it be based on the associated

via PGP what should think there's a head

638
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,410
I remember five six different bgp flow

639
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,450
spec drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there for augmenting it</font>

640
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,370
with new functionality if you're using

it you care this is an easy one<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

encapsulations yeah the working group

644
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,460
has adopted three different data plan

645
00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:00,370
encapsulations having some input as to

646
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,200
which ones you like and why that would

647
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,739
be really useful what kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> oam you</font>

IETF from v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> ops ipv6 multi-homing and</font>

00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,560
with bgp bcp 38 filtering what's the

653
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:24,639
right solution there is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real</font>

654
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:28,860
problem is it a an issue that comes up
