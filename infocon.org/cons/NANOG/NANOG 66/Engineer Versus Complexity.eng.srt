1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:12,260
alright the next talk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russ white</font>

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:20,660
turning to us again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he will you will</font>

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:23,689
watch an engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus complexity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Burt</font>

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,450
engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus complexity so you know</font>

5
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:28,130
how I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slot right because</font>

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,960
turning ran out of other things to talk

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:37,550
about an interesting presentation

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:39,219
suggestions so filling in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gap but we</font>

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,288
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> keeping with our nautical theme</font>

10
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:44,750
reach the bitter end of the line we have

11
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:48,250
unwound the line all the way from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:53,719
capstan and we have the nice bitter rope

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:55,760
left so I've been thinking about

14
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,890
complexity for a while Dave<font color="#CCCCCC"> Meyer is my</font>

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,570
inspiration<font color="#CCCCCC"> in complexity if you've ever</font>

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,239
watched him talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> complexity theory</font>

17
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,300
and stuff and Dave's an old friend and

18
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,979
he does a great job<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about it so</font>

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,119
I started thinking about this and

20
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,800
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and I've been</font>

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,380
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it at nanog for a couple</font>

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,440
of years you may or may not remember

23
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,179
some of those talks move the clock up

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,850
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going weird or something tiny</font>

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,380
it's again all right so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna start</font>

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a little bit of background if you</font>

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,289
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen my other talks on this or</font>

28
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,660
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave Meyer talk about this</font>

29
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,210
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all</font>

30
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,950
complexity is impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve this</font>

31
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,979
is kind of a turn curve but it's placed

32
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,590
in three dimensions so you have the

33
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:39,320
plane of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possible and down there in</font>

34
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,600
the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> corner here be dragons there</font>

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,429
are certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you cannot do for</font>

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,399
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cap theorem is an incidence</font>

37
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,680
of this consistent accessible partition

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,180
of all quality speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs right you go</font>

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,470
to your car mechanic and you say I want

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,570
it fast and I want the highest quality

41
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,870
parts and I want it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and I want it to</font>

42
00:01:53,570 --> 00:02:00,199
be cheap and he laughs at you as well he

43
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:03,350
should so that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way the</font>

44
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,269
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> is built complexity is impossible</font>

45
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:10,549
to solve it just happens this way so

46
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:12,560
complexity is also necessary so dave has

47
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,020
this thing about robust yet fragile that

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">he talks about and if you read Bruce</font>

49
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,790
Schneier<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot on</font>

50
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,070
if you know who Bruce Schneier is but

51
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,650
he's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big security guy and I really</font>

52
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Bruce Schneier and he talks about</font>

53
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,440
ossification and he talks about

54
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,230
fragility in security systems automated

55
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,350
security systems so but the bottom line

56
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,140
is this there is a realm there in the

57
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,480
green where things are robust as you

58
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,489
increase some complexity the curve

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,489
typically breaks over and it becomes

60
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,140
fragile as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you increase complexity more</font>

61
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,840
there's like a sweet spot a set of

62
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,000
engineering possible solutions that are

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,040
good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> completa they're good</font>

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,990
complexity there's good complexity and

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,820
by the way you notice I haven't defined

66
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,190
complexity and I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in this</font>

67
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,049
talk if you really want a definition of

68
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,240
complexity I'll point you to a book and

69
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,940
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up Dave Meyer stuff and</font>

70
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,210
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my presentation from a last year</font>

71
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:12,060
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year before at-at nanog on this</font>

72
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,010
topic because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I only have 30 minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,300
complexity takes longer than 30 minutes

74
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,040
to define but anyway so there is this

75
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,980
good complexity and there's bad

76
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,720
complexity so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of one of</font>

77
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,549
those things you deal with you have to

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,650
deal with complexity so does that mean

79
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,170
we just abandon all help hope do we just

80
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,220
give up and say oh no things are complex

81
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,589
I give up now there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two ways of</font>

82
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,060
approaching complexity the first is to

83
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,550
think through how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage complexity</font>

84
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,930
and design<font color="#CCCCCC"> and operations now these</font>

85
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,370
presentations tend to be a lot more

86
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,830
theoretical<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine tend to be a little</font>

87
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,140
more practical on this I actually wrote

88
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,060
a whole book on think happening thinking

89
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,880
through how to manage complexity and

90
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,440
network design and architecture so you

91
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,850
can go look<font color="#E5E5E5"> that up if you want to</font>

92
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,650
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

93
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,920
what I actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is</font>

94
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">how do I approach as an engineer</font>

95
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,700
complexity what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do as an engineer</font>

96
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">so after I finish writing the book this</font>

97
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,839
topic occurred to me and it was too late

98
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go back to addison wesley</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and add</font>

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,220
another chapter so it seemed like a good

100
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:17,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do like to see how that</font>

101
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">works anyway it's kind of cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,620
about as an engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> meta cognitively</font>

103
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:25,320
what am i doing to manage complexity in

104
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,300
my life as a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineer and I</font>

105
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,550
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird things like this you</font>

106
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,080
know i'm doing a PhD in philosophy so

107
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,120
it this is the type of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

108
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,210
happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my brain when I'm thinking</font>

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">about engineering problems so what I</font>

110
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,960
want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I want this is my goal by</font>

111
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way she's on the wrong side of the</font>

112
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,590
goal and I know it's a bad picture but

113
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,520
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the point is I'm looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

114
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,200
my goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you can have find a</font>

115
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,200
better picture please you know that's

116
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,890
fine that's not copyrighted by someone

117
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,050
someplace somehow it's difficult to find

118
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,640
good pictures anyway what I want to

119
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,500
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is building a metamodel I</font>

120
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,960
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about how I build models</font>

121
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,690
so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about what is my</font>

122
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,349
process or technique to understand or to

123
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,240
comprehend or process in my head

124
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,040
complexity a complex system quickly this

125
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,510
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important for me and the</font>

126
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason it's important for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me is is that</font>

127
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,170
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to just think about when I</font>

128
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,000
meet a new protocol or somebody throw

129
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,280
something at me and says I want to do

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,480
this new design as an engineer one thing

131
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,880
I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to do is to quickly</font>

132
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,950
process it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grok it I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

133
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand it very quickly what do i</font>

134
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,349
do to do that how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually</font>

135
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:37,200
work mentally so what I want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

136
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,510
want this is kind of an experimental

137
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,370
presentation but kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> narrative</font>

138
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,980
presentation and then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start</font>

139
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,750
with four common models I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

140
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,250
teach the OSI model anymore i really

141
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,720
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even teach the DoD model when i</font>

142
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,590
teach people I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the Rhino</font>

143
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,000
rhino model but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to use the DoD</font>

144
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,799
model because it illustrates a

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,110
particular thing about metamodels or

146
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,910
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we build models in our minds</font>

147
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">as engineers and I'm going to use the</font>

148
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,890
Rhino model if you've never heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

149
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,450
vinyl model it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool a really</font>

150
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,000
neat iterative model that I like a lot

151
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,500
that and I put them URL there if you

152
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,840
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it and I'm going to look</font>

153
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,940
at a couple of slides about a traffic

154
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,349
flow across a data center I do this kind

155
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,000
of stuff a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time so I look at an</font>

156
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,160
application and look at how it lays on

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fabric and try to understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

158
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,430
it's doing and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look at</font>

159
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,740
ice be fast rear out because it's kind

160
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of another example so what I want to do</font>

161
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">and each one of these is I want to</font>

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,790
figure out what these three questions

163
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:36,960
about those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to ask why I'm</font>

164
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:40,010
doing this what what questions or what

165
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,729
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> information does this process</font>

166
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,159
modeling this flow or modeling the

167
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:46,719
thing actually giving me what answers am

168
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:48,339
I getting out of this and what is this

169
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:49,960
like because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these are the three</font>

170
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:52,749
crucial things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> help me understand</font>

171
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,049
something quickly so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of my</font>

172
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:58,029
model I have why what now and this is

173
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,069
like right these are the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm</font>

174
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:01,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to work at so you're going to find</font>

175
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">there that I have the state surface</font>

176
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:05,469
optimization thing there this is

177
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,969
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that again if you want to read</font>

178
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:09,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">more about this there's a whole book on</font>

179
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:11,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">it it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool I have found</font>

180
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">it extremely extremely helpful when I</font>

181
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:16,059
look at new protocols and it looking at

182
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">even simple design things like should I</font>

183
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:21,399
aggregate here it comes down to it's a

184
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:26,008
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a straight trade off this is</font>

185
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:28,990
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> like quick cheap high quality</font>

186
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:31,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if I'm going to if I'm going to</font>

187
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,189
optimize more I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I'm going to</font>

188
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,610
bite the bullet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take more state to</font>

189
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:39,819
be more optimal my traffic flows if I'm

190
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps I'm actually that's a</font>

191
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,870
great thing it's an abstraction and it's

192
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,370
a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do DevOps but what I'm</font>

193
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,279
actually doing is I'm creating more

194
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:51,520
interaction surfaces so I'm actually

195
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:54,759
increasing complexity in some ways to

196
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,349
decrease other things in other ways so

197
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,430
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trade-offs and it's</font>

198
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:00,240
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> figuring out where those</font>

199
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:04,419
trade-offs are to build this metamodel I

200
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,770
still at the Laird dear d model so what

201
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,049
am I trying to do I'm trying to move

202
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,698
information between applications hearing

203
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,199
information down the stack across the

204
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,999
wire and back up the stack you've seen

205
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,039
this picture a million times you may not

206
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:16,899
be familiar with the DoD model it's

207
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,628
essentially the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which tcp/ip</font>

208
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:21,909
was really based the OSI model was kind

209
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:23,469
of run in parallel it's there's there's

210
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:25,899
this whole question about who invented

211
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:28,149
what first but whatever the OSI model is

212
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:30,279
it is very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to the DoD model</font>

213
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:32,229
it's just that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> div model only has</font>

214
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,779
four layers so it's simpler to put on a

215
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,519
slide and it's less messy so that's why

216
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,969
i use the DoD model for this

217
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,589
illustration so what I'm doing is I'm

218
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:43,690
carrying information down the layers if

219
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,850
I think about it I'm actually thinking

220
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,620
about my<font color="#E5E5E5"> API is between the layers I'm</font>

221
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,860
thinking about my application to

222
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,959
transport API my internet to link API on

223
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backside I'm thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my link</font>

224
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,489
to link API

225
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm actually thinking about everything</font>

226
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,880
is a set of api's so what questions am I

227
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,440
an ting answering with this model I'm

228
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,149
answering questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about things like</font>

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,970
who is responsible to do what who knows

230
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,860
what about each piece of information

231
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,120
what function does everything perform I

232
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,190
look at that transport layer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

233
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,839
like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this transport layer do</font>

234
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,640
right that's that's the type of things

235
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,589
I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it defines my</font>

236
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,910
interaction surfaces and it kind of

237
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:24,980
tells me what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with my</font>

238
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,540
interaction surfaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's a</font>

239
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,320
second model that I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use an</font>

240
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,779
example is Ryna now Ryna is this thing

241
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,269
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steven I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's steven day came</font>

242
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,399
up with or is it yeah anyway dr. day

243
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:39,380
came up with its really cool idea it's

244
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,820
an iterative model where what you do is

245
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,310
you break down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you start thinking</font>

246
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,459
about what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

247
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,410
transport protocol does what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do when I</font>

248
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:50,390
transport data is I train I have a

249
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,640
transportation section I have to

250
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,980
actually transport the data by multiplex

251
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,870
a handle errors and I do flow control

252
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,079
those are the four things that any set

253
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,209
of protocols do and what this model does

254
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,459
is it teaches<font color="#CCCCCC"> us that this is an</font>

255
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:06,890
iterative process<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I do this at</font>

256
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,930
layer 2 I do this again at layer 3 and I

257
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,569
do this again at the application layer

258
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,180
and if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it this is</font>

259
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,370
actually what you do that when I do

260
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,550
tcp/ip i actually have certain things

261
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:22,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm assigning the different layers</font>

262
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:24,680
so again what am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at what am i</font>

263
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,870
what questions my asking and answering

264
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,550
again i'm assigning responsibility who

265
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,740
does what to the data how does each

266
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,079
process accomplish its goals what are my

267
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,670
interaction surfaces so when I build a

268
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,209
layered model of a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of</font>

269
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:40,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about those types of questions</font>

270
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:41,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so here's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dataflow example I did</font>

271
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,550
this one I was working at<font color="#E5E5E5"> ericsson when</font>

272
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about some different ideas</font>

273
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:50,599
about how to do mobile data flows in a

274
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,160
day over a<font color="#CCCCCC"> datacenter fabric so here you</font>

275
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,279
know just looking at this thing so a

276
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,110
mobile service device queries a dns

277
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,089
server for service the packet has to

278
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,160
pass through<font color="#E5E5E5"> my virtual edge I have my</font>

279
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,390
flows going on here when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pass through</font>

280
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">my virtual edge I've got to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

281
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was this BSS I've got to terminate my</font>

282
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:07,520
encryption I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about other</font>

283
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,230
edge services maybe

284
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,390
I'm doing carry a great nap maybe I'm

285
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,890
not I don't know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> those services</font>

286
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,569
might happen to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have to think</font>

287
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">about where each of those functions take</font>

288
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,470
place in the network is it in a virtual

289
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,200
machine is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> sitting on it is it</font>

290
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,150
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a is it sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a router</font>

291
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,460
at the data center edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

292
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,350
where is this stuff happening and why is

293
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">it happening there and then I have to</font>

294
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,160
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the dns server do in</font>

295
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,850
response and so I build these traffic

296
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,829
flows of what I'm doing and I you know

297
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">build this whole concept of I'm going to</font>

298
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,880
build HTTP sessions and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

299
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,070
be X number of sessions when I hit a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

300
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">page off my mobile device and how that's</font>

301
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:48,290
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my with my OSS</font>

302
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,050
BSS system and and DPI and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these</font>

303
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,719
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

304
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,760
this so now what questions this ask this

305
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,060
is asking me this this I could actually

306
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,490
model as a uml because I'm really

307
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about state what state do i</font>

308
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,690
need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen at any particular</font>

309
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,210
point in this traffic flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually</font>

310
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,460
mapping out state machine here in effect

311
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so and again my next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

312
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,590
optimization so if I start thinking

313
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:19,280
about where does each thing happen how

314
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:21,380
do i optimize this flow to make the best

315
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">use of my data center fabric and of the</font>

316
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,220
VMS and compute and storage resources

317
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,690
that i have sitting here in this data

318
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,720
center so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the types of</font>

319
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:33,080
questions I'm asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here's a</font>

320
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,850
control plane example so router a uses

321
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,450
the path through B is its primary path

322
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,580
to one on a 20 20 / 24 there's a path

323
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,950
through see but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's blocked by the</font>

324
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,800
control plane why because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

325
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:48,500
potential loop and this is what SPF and

326
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,420
any sort of depth-first search algorithm

327
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,130
is going to do no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what type of</font>

328
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,069
DFS you're playing with whether it's

329
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:56,660
Dykstra is SPF or bellman-ford or dual

330
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,400
or path vector it does it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

331
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,620
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you use they all do the same</font>

332
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,090
thing they see the alternate path they

333
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,280
think it might be a loop so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they block</font>

334
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,110
it off great so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

335
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,939
use C as an alternate path in the case

336
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,980
of this link failure so I can use a

337
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,010
loop-free alternate which allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

338
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,380
actually to reach through the concept of

339
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,870
where that that potential alternate path

340
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,620
is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can think about how I can</font>

341
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,050
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this stuff</font>

342
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,420
so now I'm modeling something slightly

343
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,390
different again I'm thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

344
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,459
and state machines and where this stuff

345
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:32,130
happens and and now I'm start thinking

346
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,710
about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if I do L FAS how much</font>

347
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,830
state am i adding to the system how

348
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:40,740
often does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that state change who needs</font>

349
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,750
to own that state and who needs to

350
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,440
manage that<font color="#E5E5E5"> state when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

351
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,970
topology changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so if you ever do</font>

352
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,410
will fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> you fail your domains this is</font>

353
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,660
the best way this is my rule of thumb

354
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,430
for finding a failure domain is is a

355
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,209
failure domain is every router that

356
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:59,160
needs to recompute SPF or the best path

357
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,380
tree however it computes the best path

358
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,540
if the topology changes that's

359
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,310
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a failure domain is so</font>

360
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,170
I think about this I'm start thinking

361
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,489
about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> states</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

362
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be added here am i adding</font>

363
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:14,279
optimization here I'm trading off<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

364
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,660
against optimization so now if I look at

365
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,070
these four models I've just went through

366
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,709
really really fast and I know you're

367
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,930
tired<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're at the bitter end and</font>

368
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,520
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that but what what things am I</font>

369
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,829
looking and common questions about state

370
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,660
surface and optimization again these are

371
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,520
my trade-offs now what are my other

372
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:34,230
questions that are important by the way

373
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:37,890
that's a porpoise get it what's my

374
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:44,490
porpoise anyway sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a really bad</font>

375
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:50,160
joke<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get when you</font>

376
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:51,690
get me as a speaker you get bad jokes so

377
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,760
one of the questions are important why

378
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,959
what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem i'm solving here and</font>

379
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,760
are there other problems or solutions

380
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,810
similar to this one that I've seen in

381
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">the past that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can relate to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what</font>

382
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,670
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I doing here I'm building a metal</font>

383
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:08,610
model of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can think about a problem</font>

384
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">in relationship to standard or solid</font>

385
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,510
engineering principles and try to

386
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,130
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these do so the why</font>

387
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,189
question is so important because it's an

388
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,870
abstract<font color="#CCCCCC"> er right I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

389
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,330
stuff that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at to solve</font>

390
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,160
the problem at hand it closes off rabbit

391
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,529
trails in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of troubleshooting</font>

392
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,850
a dns problem and somebody says to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so</font>

393
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:30,490
why does<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ayah science developed a</font>

394
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">elected E is that's a really good</font>

395
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,069
question but it has nothing to do with

396
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:39,310
DNS right the why question what problem

397
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:42,219
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I trying to solve right now by asking</font>

398
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,680
why closes off rabbit trails this is a

399
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,810
form of abstraction mental abstraction

400
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,489
is what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing you it connects the</font>

401
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,138
technical to the business<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I can't</font>

402
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,680
explain why I'm doing it maybe I

403
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:55,630
shouldn't be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right so there's</font>

404
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">this whole y thing going on is this is</font>

405
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,769
an important question because its tracks

406
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,739
it forces me to abstract and it connects

407
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:05,529
my technical to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> business what is this</font>

408
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,970
like so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance finding the</font>

409
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,829
shortest path what are my common

410
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,870
solutions SPF path vector bellman-ford

411
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:12,399
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual those are the ones everybody's</font>

412
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,319
familiar with i'll give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the</font>

413
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,449
protocols if you don't know them SPF is

414
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:19,930
of course is is no SPF path vector is

415
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:25,258
bgp bellman-ford is rip may it rest in

427
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,389
see somebody using Dykstra SPF to solve

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,059
wedgies because nobody's policy matches

445
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:36,700
so of course those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are reflected in the</font>

for this class

450
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,780
sick is a spanning tree protocol failure

451
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:50,050
through a crash because the spanning

452

00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:55,149
loop for a moment a micro loop the thing

454
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,740
causes the control plane to fail this is

455
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,980
a feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop that's exactly what this</font>

European I actually dropped packets it's

461
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,250
just a trade-off right so now i can

462
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,990
think about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody tells me</font>

464
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,620
and I recognize they're using SPF I know

465
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,870
what kind of problems to look for that's

466
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,449
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good mental tool to have in your</font>

here reliable data connection or

didn't do all the possibilities here but

477
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,690
nonetheless you can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing the</font>

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,939
what problem in my solving it narrows my

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at state surface and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm seeing better optimal traffic flows</font>

optimize my data flows I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

495
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,929
what is it doing my interaction surfaces

496
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,790
what is it doing to my state I must be

adding state or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet interaction</font>

498
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:34,720
surface someplace I've got to be because

499
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,449
I can't get better optimization without

500
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,429
doing one of those two things right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

501
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,800
know now what questions I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

502
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:44,400
asking which is kind of cool this is

503
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,928
like has this problem been solved before

504
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,420
how was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> solved and what were the</font>

505
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems in solving the problem before I</font>

506
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,220
should be able to directly relate these

507
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,260
things this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> metamodel to</font>

508
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,210
understanding complex

00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly I really like this i've</font>

510
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,080
discovered that since i actually wrote

511
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,910
this down and started thinking about it

512
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,800
and trying to understand it that it's

513
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,170
actually implicit in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we do</font>

514
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,850
as engineers it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we just don't</font>

515
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,890
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it explicit but this is kind of</font>

516
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,480
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do so I think it's really really</font>

517
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,210
really cool build an abstract model by

518
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,980
asking the right questions so the

519
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest issue with the abstractions</font>

520
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,770
where the why question is abstractions

521
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,910
leak right<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lynn skis law of leaky</font>

522
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:30,230
abstractions right extractions leak and

523
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:33,360
so for instance aggregation leaks if i

524
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,650
change the metric or if the a2b link

525
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,350
fails<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through this</font>

526
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:43,560
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing but you know if if your if</font>

527
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">your if your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> metric for your aggregate</font>

528
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:50,540
is dependent on a component that fails

529
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:54,150
the metric for the aggregate changes

530
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:57,540
hence<font color="#E5E5E5"> the abstraction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregate</font>

531
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:59,640
has now leaked through that there was a

532
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,560
topology change behind it right this is

533
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,320
a leaky abstraction<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp trans</font>

534
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,750
retransmissions are in a sense a leaky

535
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,270
abstraction i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at lower level</font>

536
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,790
stuff going on i see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cue drop which</font>

537
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:15,360
causes a failure in tcp<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm actually</font>

538
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,830
leaking the abstraction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the of what</font>

539
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,949
appears to me to be a point-to-point

540
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,679
connection and I'm actually seeing stuff

541
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,870
from underneath that show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in my TCP</font>

542
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,350
embedded IP addresses are my favorite

543
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,909
leaky abstractions by the way we embed

544
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,100
IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all sorts of things and</font>

545
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it really drives me a little bit nuts</font>

546
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,679
but anyway abstractions hide things

547
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,300
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this means you don't understand</font>

548
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,180
the system in detail as well as you'd

549
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,340
like but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't build complex systems</font>

550
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:47,820
without abstractions it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

551
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,800
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so the nice thing i've</font>

552
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,330
discovered is that the more models<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

553
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,340
build about something the better<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

554
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,159
understand it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more ways i look at</font>

555
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:59,040
something if i understand the tcp/ip

556
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,470
stack from the OSI model the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DoD model</font>

557
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,210
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rhino model it actually helps me</font>

558
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:06,150
understand what's going on a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

559
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,150
because now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have three models to wrap</font>

560
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:12,320
around this

561
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:14,540
so again very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple y se surface</font>

562
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,360
and optimization what in hell and then

563
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,980
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like and in it these three</font>

564
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,870
questions if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think about these</font>

565
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">three questions it's a really useful way</font>

566
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:27,080
I'm finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself to nail down the</font>

567
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,300
complexity from an engineering

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,030
perspective of my perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like</font>

569
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,830
conquer complexity when I see it I see
