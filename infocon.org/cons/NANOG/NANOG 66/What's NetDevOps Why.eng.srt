15
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:06,580
industry about 15 years now I've been an

16
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,830
operations engineer at a lot of major

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:13,570
websites you might recognize like Google

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:16,329
or craigslist and now I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the board</font>

19
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:22,119
of directors at SF mix and a funemployed

20
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:24,008
bum for my day job you are people who

21
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,049
are network engineers who are automation

22
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:28,659
curious but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running your network</font>

23
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:30,310
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traditional model or you're a</font>

24
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,840
systems engineer and you love your

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,909
network engineers and you want to help

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,340
them come to this great new world of

27
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,500
automation and DevOps so if you're

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,890
already automating everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congrats</font>

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,890
Oh

30
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:51,130
there congrats you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> your laptop</font>

31
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:51,130
back out and start surfing the web again

32
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:55,490
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to take you on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

33
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,979
first steps of taking your

34
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,949
infrastructure from legacy style to

35
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:02,539
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the new DevOps model but what</font>

36
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,539
do I even mean when I say the word

37
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,709
DevOps right like if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask a hundred</font>

38
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,920
people you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a hundred</font>

39
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:13,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">different answers but really at the very</font>

40
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,470
core for a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> developers and sis</font>

41
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,609
admins weren't communicating so this

42
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:21,530
caused<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of friction between teams</font>

43
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,690
DevOps is the idea that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> these teams</font>

44
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,900
work together all of your production

45
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,940
environment is in a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

46
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,340
but what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the most important</font>

47
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:37,069
part is that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your infrastructure</font>

48
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:39,470
is now thought of and described by code

49
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,540
you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> some great tools like puppet</font>

50
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,370
or chef or ansible and our

51
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,170
infrastructure can be completely managed

52
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,139
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> described by code so there's no more</font>

53
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:53,720
logging into that router so today we can

54
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:56,989
be in a much better place so now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,420
the dog of ops working with the pony of

56
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:01,459
dev to leave the kiddies<font color="#CCCCCC"> of everyone</font>

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,760
else right<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> networking systems that</font>

58
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:07,670
works team so DevOps is leaving the pack

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,179
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now the network team is still</font>

60
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,160
really just being pulled along right our

61
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:18,620
traditional networking methodology is

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:20,810
still pretty old-fashioned so first we

63
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,569
get it we get our new router we're

64
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,819
logging in manually with a password

65
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,828
typing in passwords or typing in

66
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:32,750
commands on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the command line on the live</font>

67
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:34,040
routers as they exist I'm who hear what

68
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,630
they set up a new router has had to cut

69
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,620
and paste<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire configuration over</font>

70
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:41,750
a console everyone yeah exactly and who

71
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,280
here has had<font color="#E5E5E5"> the console buffer run out</font>

72
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:49,549
and then you're wondering why it hasn't

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:51,440
worked yeah you know a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendors</font>

74
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,810
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolled back which is cool right I</font>

75
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,840
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll back</font>

76
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,640
rancid has really historically been the

77
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,410
only decent tool that works on

78
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything you can save configurations</font>

79
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:08,000
in state and you know rancid has been

80
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:12,080
great for what it's done but I think

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ready to move on from that and who</font>

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,010
here has had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a typo bring down their</font>

83
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,168
whole network maybe I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask who</font>

84
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:22,700
hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a type out bring down their</font>

85
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:26,810
network anyone hasn't yeah come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on we we</font>

86
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,340
all can<font color="#E5E5E5"> omit it so why are why are we</font>

87
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,770
all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> why right so old-fashioned like</font>

88
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,989
this right well everyone in the

89
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,820
automation world sort of forgets that

90
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,310
these lot of our automation tools have

91
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,300
been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while has anyone here</font>

92
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:43,190
heard of CF engine yeah all right CF

93
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:47,870
engine is often<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought of as one of the</font>

94
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:50,510
first usable systems automation tools so

95
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:57,260
does anyone here know when CF engine was

96
00:04:50,510 --> 00:05:00,110
ridden anyone 1906 is a guest from the

97
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:06,169
audience very close just a little early

98
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:09,160
but still right millennium 1993 right so

99
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:12,770
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here probably your cisco</font>

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:17,240
when do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think Cisco's 1pk was</font>

101
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:21,919
released to the general public with not

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:24,260
1906<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's early 2014 so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> systems</font>

103
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,630
world has actually had about a 20 year

104
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:30,080
head start on the network world because

105
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know easy so that's the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> systems</font>

106
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,950
roles had 20 more years to have easy

107
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,530
interaction with the systems and without

108
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,110
the help of good tools and most

109
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,250
importantly the help of vendors

110
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,050
supporting and enabling you to interact

111
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,350
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those tools so wonder that we've</font>

112
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:48,560
been stuck behind but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here to tell</font>

113
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:51,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that automation is for everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

114
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,160
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you how to get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

115
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,840
magic world of working together network

116
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,220
engineers and systems engineers work

117
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:03,140
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can make our lives</font>

118
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:05,150
better so here's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of common</font>

119
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,500
complaints and fears that I've heard

120
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:11,179
from people

121
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:14,840
um it's a fad but I think as we can now

122
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:19,400
see automation is no longer a fad been

123
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:22,429
around for a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> bath over 30 years it's</font>

124
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard that's that's legitimate it is hard</font>

125
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,820
but also people in this room here run

126
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:33,530
the internet like that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

127
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">right I've heard another fear of losing</font>

128
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,090
jobs like hey if you know we automate

129
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,489
all these things like half my<font color="#E5E5E5"> team's</font>

130
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go but that never really</font>

131
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,160
happens right usually budgets for your

132
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">teams they rarely go down but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to</font>

133
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,330
learn all more all those awesome new

134
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:57,080
stuff and one wrong move will take

135
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:59,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything down yes but as everyone here</font>

136
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,909
already noticed one wrong typo has taken

137
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,489
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and with automation you</font>

138
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:10,010
can use computer checks to help lessen

139
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:12,260
the risk my gear doesn't support it 2016

140
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,300
this is still very true of a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

141
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,430
hardware but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to show you some</font>

142
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,220
ways you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> shortcut around it to get</font>

143
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,610
to you eighty-five percent good until

144
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:25,820
your gear minds of supporting this but

145
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:28,970
the biggest problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fear I've heard</font>

146
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:32,290
is that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know where to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start but</font>

147
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:35,630
that's why you're here<font color="#CCCCCC"> right it is time</font>

148
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:39,530
today you're going to trust the

149
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:42,169
computers the internet is built on<font color="#CCCCCC"> trust</font>

150
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,780
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp peering it's basically</font>

151
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,880
trusting that that person over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

152
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,940
going to send me you know the correct

153
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,909
bits that really should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to that</font>

154
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,610
person over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ah so how are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we going</font>

155
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,650
to get starting there are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many logos</font>

156
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,210
look at all these choices all these

157
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,179
different people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is just a</font>

158
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:06,289
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the logos support support</font>

159
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,669
automation and one of the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> things is</font>

160
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,710
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't even have to be a</font>

161
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:12,080
programmer because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can cheat and use</font>

162
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,669
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these other cool tools they see</font>

163
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,710
all those things on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand side</font>

164
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,020
that other people have written so really

165
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest problem you have is social</font>

166
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,128
and not

167
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,819
technical so we are going to start

168
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:27,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">learning I believe in you so before I</font>

169
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,360
start here i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to mention since</font>

170
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,340
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rose recent job was for cumulus</font>

171
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,320
networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have written these</font>

172
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,078
configuration snippets just using

173
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,479
cumulus but I know many of you aren't

174
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:40,458
using it and it's okay that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these</font>

175
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,620
techniques will work with any gear that

176
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:50,719
you on so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go do it on any</font>

177
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:53,300
equipment it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 start</font>

178
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,029
using it it is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a text file</font>

179
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,459
repository you have automatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> filer</font>

180
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,980
visions and change management it's built

181
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:02,599
so that many teams large number of

182
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,940
people's can work on the same files

183
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,550
usually without too much problems and

184
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,589
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to get started but</font>

185
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:16,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's still a lot of knobs and tweaks</font>

186
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:19,670
for very advanced users so I look here I

187
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:23,510
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> XKCD comic really gives me the feel</font>

188
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:26,660
what I feel about<font color="#E5E5E5"> get github is a great</font>

189
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:29,750
new place to start it's free for public

190
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:32,360
repositories really cheap for private

191
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,820
repositories and they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

192
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,770
great little tutorial right there try

193
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:42,050
github<font color="#CCCCCC"> daioh and and also a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

194
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:46,490
probably already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have other teams that</font>

195
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,810
are using it so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

196
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,670
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'm going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using here</font>

197
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,699
that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll see all</font>

198
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,829
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the get world so remote repository</font>

199
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,700
is really the central server that hosts

200
00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:00,349
the files and local repository is your

201
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,079
laptop right you've pulled all the files

202
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:07,339
to your your laptop or local repository

203
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:10,189
a branch is you can make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new copy of</font>

204
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:14,149
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the repository for new features or</font>

205
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,589
risky changes and merge it's like it

206
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:18,199
sounds right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pushed back these</font>

207
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:22,640
branches together to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the master</font>

208
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:24,920
repository copy now one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,870
things is you cannot automate if you

210
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,329
don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have so you just</font>

211
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:33,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">check in all of your configs that's</font>

212
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:35,638
that's step two very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

213
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:38,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be amazed at all of these</font>

214
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,269
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you didn't know you had</font>

215
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,540
you're gonna be like oh shoot this

216
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:44,489
firewall has<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the username for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

217
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,129
this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who was fired like five</font>

218
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:49,790
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago how come no one notice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

219
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:53,420
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't have all your configs</font>

220
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,949
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just gonna use github to show you</font>

221
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,339
nice little<font color="#E5E5E5"> display of changes in action</font>

222
00:10:55,949 --> 00:11:01,139
check this out<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hey look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

223
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,269
logged in and change all this quality

224
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,989
configuration you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see this because</font>

225
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:08,579
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have everything checked in to get</font>

226
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:12,209
step three is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to template eyes your</font>

227
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:14,609
configuration files right templates let

228
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:16,859
you reuse your code snippets when you

229
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,439
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for a lot of your routers</font>

230
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,600
and switches you have the same basic

231
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:25,799
things right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have your user</font>

232
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,769
information passwords some generics set

233
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,480
of interfaces so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it</font>

234
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:34,679
a lot of your configurations are pretty

235
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,480
similar and and you can even have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

236
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,819
configuration management make your

237
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,749
configurations and then if your gear

238
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:46,189
doesn't support any clients you can just

239
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:49,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">cut and paste so here's a little example</font>

240
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:53,519
cool so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just using puppet you</font>

241
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:57,119
can see here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a network server</font>

242
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,480
which is showing us switch configuration

243
00:11:57,119 --> 00:12:03,329
generating switch configurations the web

244
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,850
they're saying hey look and this this

245
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:08,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">switch leaf one hears its IP address</font>

246
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,799
here's its web servers interfaces

247
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,949
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> storage server and on the</font>

248
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">right-hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side config</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PP you can see</font>

249
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:18,149
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is taking all of these</font>

250
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:20,129
variables<font color="#E5E5E5"> and putting them in to a</font>

251
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:24,059
switch template switch configuration

252
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:26,489
template and here is the template so you

253
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,110
see here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty simple right you</font>

254
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:30,869
got your loopback interface that has an

255
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,999
IP got a web server VLAN it's got some

256
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:37,559
interfaces in it got a storage VLAN got

257
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:38,910
some interfaces than that tada you've

258
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,649
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've just made your first</font>

259
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:45,410
configuration file

260
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:50,240
so now you've transformed your

261
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:53,930
configuration into code tada so that's a

262
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">good news right we're done what got 18</font>

263
00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:02,149
minutes not yet the bad news is that

264
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:04,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're still stuck in silos right so</font>

265
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:09,040
raise your hand here if your network and

266
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:12,680
systems teams are separate teams yeah

267
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,589
it's a lot right so raise your hand if

268
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,649
they're all the same team yeah a couple

269
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:21,320
what's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool so teams often</font>

270
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:23,269
have ticket walls right a great example

271
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like to use is with machine turnips</font>

272
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,860
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and forth to between</font>

273
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the teams</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right instead of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling like</font>

274
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,519
you're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> together the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> systems</font>

275
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,950
teams putting in a ticket to the network

276
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,050
team to turn up is poor interrupt us via

277
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,370
a network team says okay I did it and

278
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">then system schemes like oh shoot I</font>

279
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,390
meant that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a web server not you know</font>

280
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,910
storage server now they go back and

281
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,890
forth and so as network engineers we all

282
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,899
have way better things to do than just

283
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,209
assigning machines to ports and vlans

284
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,410
and systems engineers feel like the

285
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:55,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">network team is just holding them back</font>

286
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,930
so both<font color="#CCCCCC"> sides are unhappy and everyone's</font>

287
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:01,820
day just feels<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's being filled up</font>

288
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:05,089
with boring ticket junk so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

289
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,220
get branches come to the rescue right so

290
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:09,500
let's say cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am on the system's team</font>

291
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,430
I want to add this new machine this<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

292
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:17,680
VLAN make a branch called VLAN and then

293
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,699
I can I can then do a pull request

294
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,510
basically a request that allows me to

295
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:26,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">merge the branches in this allows the</font>

296
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,910
network team to check and you know

297
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,089
approve any of the changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

298
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:35,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">system's team to do the work themselves</font>

299
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:37,820
so here's just a great little example

300
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:40,459
showing in the github you I it's very

301
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:44,209
easy look<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right cool I just put a</font>

302
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:46,339
branch in saying new VLAN I opened a

303
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:47,479
pull request hey this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I were a</font>

304
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,750
little skirt prescription<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what I</font>

305
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,880
wanted to do I've web server to new VLAN

306
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,160
and then

307
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network team can approve or deny my</font>

308
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,079
request right pretty cool all you have

309
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,660
to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit that merge pull request or</font>

310
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,200
can make some comments saying no<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

311
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,390
made the worst mistake ever so one of

312
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best part is that get allows you to</font>

313
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:14,480
restrict who can approve changes so you

314
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,420
get you can have your cake and eat it

315
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,220
too you get the security from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the silos</font>

316
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,040
but you've removed the ticket wall

317
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:29,090
between teams so now everyone's starting

318
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:31,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work together of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font>

319
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:33,350
there's also more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just this there's</font>

320
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,660
some great advanced tools I could make a

321
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,640
hole there talk about this but since

322
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,800
everyone wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of here I'll</font>

323
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,420
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention the two things that I think</font>

324
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">will make the biggest impact on your day</font>

325
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,640
continuous integration systems these are

326
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,290
great it's something that can run checks

327
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,500
in your code every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you check it in</font>

328
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,930
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> travis CI is a great of free online</font>

329
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,390
options and jenkins is another great

330
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,160
free<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source project in many</font>

331
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,900
workplaces you'll probably already have

332
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,370
one of these such as you know ask all of

333
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,829
your co-workers on the other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

334
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">your wall how you can plug into it so</font>

335
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,060
for me I can't type some things

336
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,250
correctly right I mean you know

337
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,949
sometimes I'm like oh shoot i just

338
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,990
always make this typo so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got this</font>

339
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,550
list of words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i misspelled anytime</font>

340
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,020
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check something in I run it</font>

341
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,819
through Jenkins if Jenkins finds these

342
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,670
words it gives me a failure message

343
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:29,060
doesn't let me check it in pretty cool

344
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,040
right and for extra extra advance credit

345
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,229
you can write more tests around<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

346
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,880
configurations just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

347
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:39,860
you aren't making some common mistakes

348
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:42,080
that we all make so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next best thing</font>

349
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,080
is to virtualize a copy of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

350
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,720
one of the so everyone knows that all

351
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,150
the vendors have their own virtualized

352
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">platform some are free and some are only</font>

353
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:55,760
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've paid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton gns3 is really</font>

354
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,650
cool it is a free open source option

355
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,500
that supports almost every platform

356
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,390
there is so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime you want to make</font>

357
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,069
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> change you can try it out on your</font>

358
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,220
virtual network to make sure it works

359
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,599
before hand right so you

360
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,760
have to trust that the firewall change

361
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,789
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going to work and that new</font>

362
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,980
cool bgp idea you can test it and tweak

363
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:16,270
it to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your 2am</font>

364
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,730
maintenance is going to go smoothly

365
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,859
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 2am you don't want to be</font>

366
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,780
troubleshooting right but my biggest

367
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:25,208
problem with virtualization is after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

368
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:29,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">got hooked I wonder I'm like how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can i</font>

369
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:31,990
ever live without this so in the last

370
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,270
advanced topic is to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a leap of</font>

371
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,340
faith and install the automation clients

372
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:40,030
directly on your switches or routers of

373
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:43,600
course not all equipment has a client

374
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:45,970
yet but you all can bug your vendors or

375
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,149
your vendors bug your other team members

376
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,120
inside your company to support you know

377
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:57,960
one or more of these common automation

378
00:17:52,120 --> 00:18:01,120
platforms so now we're happy right yay

379
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,280
but once again oh there's still 12

380
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,620
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> left you're like this sounds</font>

381
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,740
great Leslie this is awesome but what

382
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:11,229
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> when things go wrong right let</font>

383
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,030
let's check out I made a mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

384
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:16,120
this I must type my loop back I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

385
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:19,720
a / 3 that's not gonna go very well

386
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,928
right and as a little side<font color="#CCCCCC"> note I know</font>

387
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,820
at least three major websites where this

388
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:27,490
exact kind of typos<font color="#CCCCCC"> has happened it's</font>

389
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,950
taken down a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic and sure</font>

390
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,299
you're all prop hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> using peer</font>

391
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,880
review have it someone look over your

392
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:35,470
shoulder before you hit Enter but maybe

393
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:41,169
your reviewer didn't have their coffee

394
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:50,740
so I push the config it's going so well

395
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm so excited all right it's got a

396
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,000
botched just one more time love it

397
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:02,530
yeah your website is down and your pager

398
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,200
is blowing up like a puppy so<font color="#CCCCCC"> your pager</font>

399
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,178
is ringing you might not have time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

400
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,610
through all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes that you</font>

401
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:12,220
just did<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out specifically what</font>

402
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:15,129
went wrong and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're right because you</font>

403
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,990
want their website back up now so this

404
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:21,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rollback comes to the</font>

405
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:24,790
rescue boom since get can keep track of

406
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:27,280
each incremental change a get revert

407
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,590
tells you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just undo the previous</font>

408
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,240
change so this way you can get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

409
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:37,209
into a safe state so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go if you</font>

410
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,299
are certain it with the last change here

411
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:43,210
are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the commands you need to</font>

412
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,770
get your network or your git repository

413
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,030
back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good state then of course</font>

414
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you still have to push</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out to your</font>

415
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,740
network but this way you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

416
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,010
worry about where<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this last change</font>

417
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:56,380
come from and of course when you make a

418
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,450
commit it is only reflected in the local

419
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,270
branch that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> why I get push is very</font>

420
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,520
important so that it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto that</font>

421
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:07,600
remote repository or server make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

422
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,840
the fixes process is propagated who

423
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,490
we're all better now we fix a problem

424
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,389
we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit of breathing room</font>

425
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:18,610
all right but this brings up actually my

426
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,160
favorite part of the DevOps philosophy

427
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,530
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> post mortem because without</font>

428
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,950
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> post-mortem to tell you what went</font>

429
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:31,600
wrong you're clicking your heels and

430
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:33,549
wishing it never happens again so post

431
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,350
mortems are seriously the best part

432
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:38,049
about develop sculptures it's about

433
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:40,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">finding ways to improve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your process to</font>

434
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:44,320
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that technical mistakes don't</font>

435
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:46,659
happen again right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is not about</font>

436
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,659
assigning blame to people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

437
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:54,059
important but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do have to be</font>

438
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely accurate right let's say you</font>

439
00:20:54,059 --> 00:21:00,428
got really drunk<font color="#CCCCCC"> at nanog and at 3am you</font>

440
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,169
decided it would be a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to go</font>

441
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:04,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data center and do a handstand</font>

442
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:06,909
and you bumped into your router and you

443
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,950
broke<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right you have to</font>

444
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:11,379
up to this because that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only way</font>

445
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,509
we can fix things and that last part

446
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:16,059
about a good post mortem is fixing

447
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:17,559
things how can we enact an institutional

448
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:20,440
or technical change to prevent this from

449
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:22,539
happening again so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

450
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,940
case we can install breathalyzers on the

451
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:28,090
doors<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data center there you go no</font>

452
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,340
more drunk 3am trips or in a more

453
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,289
practical note we can use one of our

454
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,330
continuous integration systems to write

455
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:38,889
a test to check for a configuration

456
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:42,699
mistake so it's very important that

457
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:44,199
everyone realizes that failure is ok you

458
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,220
want everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feel comfortable when</font>

459
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,440
they mess up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all humans so</font>

460
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:54,970
now you've gotten to get rid of a lot of

461
00:21:50,440 --> 00:22:01,330
dredge work oh yeah so you've moved from

462
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:06,429
this to this so I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over</font>

463
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:08,289
what we just did first set up get then

464
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:10,389
you can transform all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

465
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:14,289
configuration into code using template

466
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:16,059
eyes templates break down the silos and

467
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:17,830
the evil ticket walls by encouraging

468
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:21,220
your co-workers to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

469
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:22,570
with pull requests and then for extra

470
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,999
credit you can use continuous

471
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,830
integration tools and virtualization to

472
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:29,320
help you<font color="#CCCCCC"> out test your configurations</font>

473
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,989
before you deploy them and then you can

474
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,499
use configuration management agents to

475
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:37,899
pull the changes automatically and now

476
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:44,129
you're on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> journey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great land</font>

477
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:44,129
of teamwork and net DevOps any questions

478
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:50,159
please just come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the microphone</font>

479
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:09,830
and Viktor from visa so question is jet

480
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:13,850
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been used by the software engineers</font>

481
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:17,600
for a while for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> network operators we</font>

482
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:21,740
need to know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowledge behind those</font>

483
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:26,510
configuration files do you have any like

484
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:29,990
hints like if I make some changes DNA

485
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:35,330
like a code book to help us validate our

486
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:38,630
changes well for the validation also

487
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:40,309
first one other cool thing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> get is</font>

488
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,409
when you make a configuration change and

489
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:44,750
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make a commit message which is a</font>

490
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:46,850
little summer to tell you so you can see

491
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll line by line what someone's</font>

492
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,870
changed and hopefully they've written a

493
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:57,529
descriptive message on why they've done

494
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:59,149
that for I mean for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can ask your</font>

495
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:01,580
fellow software engineers to help you

496
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:04,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">out with get just for learning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that part</font>

497
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,320
but then you already are bringing to the

498
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:10,100
table all of the network configuration

499
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,168
knowledge that you already have so that

500
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,330
way if you work together hopefully you

501
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:18,350
come up with a much better way did you

502
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:21,199
have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow-ups all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right we do use</font>

503
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,480
some software which its commercial

504
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,029
software to do the change of validation

505
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:30,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so if you use a virtual if you</font>

506
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:31,760
virtualize your network like using you

507
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:33,860
know free open-source software or

508
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,510
commercial software then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

509
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,299
favorite thing because you can even have

510
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:40,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">a hook in your get system that as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soon</font>

511
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:43,850
as you commit it will then you know spin

512
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:45,919
up a virtual virtual environment or go

513
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,350
to the virtual environment and then you

514
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,389
know you can make some tests just make

515
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:54,490
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everything runs ok yeah so</font>

516
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:57,740
that that's virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> is amazing oh</font>

517
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:00,620
I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what I was trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

518
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:04,130
is you want the automation framework

519
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:06,739
chef they have a audit auditing feature

520
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:09,049
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't take a look yet but I</font>

521
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,630
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking maybe you know you know</font>

522
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:15,070
more frameworks or related things around

523
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,070
there thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

524
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:23,799
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're next yeah</font>

525
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:27,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">Octavio Alvarez from global</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chat first</font>

526
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:29,549
call for for the vendors to include the

527
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:32,710
friendly output in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their CLI</font>

528
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:37,960
because as a human it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to know</font>

529
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:40,720
that I device rebooted by by reading

530
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:44,080
that the uptime is low but if I'm using

531
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,369
get revisions it's really useless to

532
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,129
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different number each time I</font>

533
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:51,699
commit or audit advice so it will be

534
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:55,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">better to have when did the device last</font>

535
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,309
good so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first comment and a</font>

536
00:25:55,029 --> 00:26:00,700
question what if there's always

537
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:02,918
exceptions to the rules what if one

538
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,580
needs to do some temporary changes like

539
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:10,690
shutting down a bgp pier for maintenance

540
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:13,149
that should actually not go into into

541
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,559
configuration management or maybe it

542
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:17,109
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know what you're taking</font>

543
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,960
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still use configuration</font>

544
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:22,749
management for that you can put a note

545
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,669
like a comment and notes saying this

546
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:26,649
should be temporary but one of the cool

547
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:28,899
things about configuration management is

548
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:31,268
that like let's say made a commit and

549
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:33,459
all it is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> shutting down to be gpp are</font>

550
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:35,470
right for a maintenance well then I

551
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,350
could just revert<font color="#CCCCCC"> that specific commit</font>

552
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,389
to get to get your configuration back

553
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,789
because you definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> you always want</font>

554
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:45,248
in my mind I like to think of every

555
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:48,190
switch and router is actually temporary

556
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:50,619
so it could go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow and I want</font>

557
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,119
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure or go in a minute I want to</font>

558
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:54,309
make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know fourth</font>

559
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:58,059
replacement the configuration is exact

560
00:26:54,309 --> 00:27:00,279
and precise and correct so I like for no

561
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:03,119
matter how small of a change to put it

562
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:06,730
in configuration management thank you

563

existence of ticket walls between

566

departments and yeah oh please can have

567
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:18,970
a VLAN here and some IP addresses there

568
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:21,759

what do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

572
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:32,570
advantages of having config all to make

573
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:37,300
having the config automation and the

574
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:39,500
continuous integration in terms of I'm

575

it's going to turn into a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> roles</font>

on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question this speed you did not</font>

577
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,420
mention speed and I think I think that's

578
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:50,210
something that's mr. because literally

579
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,309
you can look at this and look at what's

580
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,400
being changed and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just go lgtm</font>

581
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:56,840
them gone and and there's no here you go

582
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">and outlook data ticket because you're</font>

583
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,000
creating your audit trail as you go as

584
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,870
well of all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've done</font>

585
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,850
whereas you know right now you've got

586
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">this thing where collect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rate me a VLAN</font>

587
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,669
here when you go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a VLAN there</font>

588
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,210
and then you paste back into the ticket

589
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:13,870
what you've done so yeah as well as that

590
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,309
cozy cozy cozy group hug kind of thing

591
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,260
as other kittens and things involved

592
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:19,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll talking about cozy group hugs yeah</font>

593
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,770
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's a speed thing</font>

594
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,840
that's a very good point also because

595
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:27,230
you know if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a thousand</font>

596
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,939
line configuration you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

597
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">humans it can be tough to see exactly</font>

598
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">what change whereas get if you looked at</font>

599
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,809
that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the UI's it's</font>

600
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,460
just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in red and green it's bright</font>

601
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,470
it's there you can see exactly what

602
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">change and you then only have a single</font>

603
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,520
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> of truth you don't have to trust</font>

604
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:45,980
that someone cut and pasted the correct

605
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,420
lines in because you know you haven't

606
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your coffee maybe you forget a</font>

607
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,620
change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't get the cut of</font>

608
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,490
pace it in but thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

609
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:56,928
excellent point hi there Jeff stuff for

610
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">Makka my one question you had mentioned</font>

611
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:01,520
earlier about clients for particular

612
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:03,830
vendors yes what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your opinion I have</font>

613
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,780
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slow adoption rate primarily</font>

614
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,899
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the vendors are pushing</font>

615
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,940
their own configuration management you

616
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,250
know whiz-bang of the month or the week

617
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,080
or the year for that configuration

618
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,809
automation I've seen a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow</font>

619
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,149
adoption rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> into wherein the sysadmin</font>

620
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:23,510
world you know open source is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

621
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:26,600
fluid a lot more accepting so what have

622
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:29,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">you seen from vendors trying to either a</font>

623
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,730
from a client standpoint or going more

624
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,460
into the adoption rate of using this and

625
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,559
then kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Part B of the question is</font>

626
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,120
how do you

627
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:38,740
see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> being further and further</font>

628
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,439
integrated into software-defined

629
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,879
networking well I'll give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

630
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">short answer because this is something</font>

631
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:50,620
buy me a beer later and I can talk for

632
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:52,299
hours about it I so one problem about

633
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,729
different vendors trying to make their

634
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:57,100
own special solution is that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

635
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,419
sudden you've those two<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems you've</font>

636
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:02,199
lost all its institutional knowledge

637
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:03,429
like let's like for chef I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

638
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,230
google this and there's there's

639
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:07,539
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thousands of people who</font>

640
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:10,090
have run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into problems similar to mine</font>

641
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,830
which is Google's really your best

642
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,990
resource or or Yahoo or Bing or

643
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:17,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">DuckDuckGo don't want to be you know</font>

644
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:19,779
single anyone out and so when a vendor

645
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:22,629
says I want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something special</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

646
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:24,460
says all of a sudden I have to I have to

647
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:25,600
learn a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more so this makes a</font>

648
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,519
community of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are learning</font>

649
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,539
this very small I don't gain from this

650
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:33,309
institutional knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

651
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:37,029
you're once again saying that networks

652
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:39,369
are incredibly special and different

653
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:41,259
where there are some different

654
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:44,168
applications that we do but also there's

655
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:47,590
still at their core usually linux-based

656
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:50,799
systems and so we shouldn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

657
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,629
our our tools have to be special we can

658
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,330
use all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> great tools that have</font>

659
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:57,699
already been<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed plus if there's a</font>

660
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,189
tool that's used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know millions of</font>

661
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">people it's less likely that that tool</font>

662
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,149
is going to just get dropped and not

663
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:06,399
supported versus you have a specialized

664
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:09,279
vendor tool it's only used by maybe a

665
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,110
thousand people just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know no</font>

666
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter how many switches and routers we</font>

667
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:18,070
have there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be more servers</font>

668
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:21,639
it's just a fact and i have seen slow

669
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:25,178
adoption from pretty much almost every

670
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:28,600
vendor there's been two sides well one

671
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:31,629
I'm on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their side it's hard that's more</font>

672
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">than two sides another is that as soon</font>

673
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:36,009
as you have an easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> API to work with</font>

674
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:40,990
multiple vendors it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

675
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:43,029
switch so that is a downside and also

676
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing that all of the people</font>

677
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:48,210
purchasing can do is really push and and

678
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:51,630
sis like a having recently

679
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:54,000
from a vendor the biggest voice in where

680
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,890
what feature is developed next is people

681
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,470
talking to sales engineers and saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

682
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:00,450
need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this because you know</font>

683
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:04,080
they're for-profit companies and money

684
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,760
talks so if everyone here writes your

685
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,889
sales engineer right now and says I

686
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,350
insist<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you support all the</font>

687
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:13,770
automation clients that will really<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

688
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:16,860
get things moving hopefully that's

689
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:18,240
enough of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer and yes please buy</font>

690
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:24,780
me a beer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will rant about it for</font>

691
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:26,790
hours oh sorry all right I stuff you

692
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,010
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Jeff I'm from</font>

693
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:32,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">dannic just a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of notes we do it</font>

694
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:33,629
since a long time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the first</font>

695
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,429
thing is if you want to find out how

696
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,230
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're already our day is this</font>

697
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,360
buzzword continuous delivery and there's

698
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:44,040
a so called continuous delivery maturity

699
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,629
model so it's basically a thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

700
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,280
do with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> team where you can find out</font>

701
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,160
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> good you always continuous delivery</font>

702
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,590
and there are at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think for four</font>

703
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,870
levels and so it's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

704
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,909
to get a baseline how good you currently

705
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:59,659
are and where you stand and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gives</font>

706
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:02,040
value valuable tips the other thing is

707
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:05,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">you didn't show how you organize your</font>

708
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:08,040
data in our company the problem is when

709
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the CD stuff started all the</font>

710
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,879
companies have different databases

711
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,440
configuration item databases and you

712
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,730
have to merge them you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font>

713
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,160
way how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for example how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you store</font>

714
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:23,160
your DNS names how do you store IP data

715
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,500
and so on how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that I get</font>

716
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,810
the side for every company yeah but if

717
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look online github has a lot</font>

718
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:32,970
of people's configuration repositories

719
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:35,010
