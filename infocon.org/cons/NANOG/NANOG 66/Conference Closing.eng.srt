for another week so<font color="#E5E5E5"> please go take the</font>

56
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,480
survey be you won't get a prize for it

57
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:28,940
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i didn't look at the early survey</font>

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,390
results and i thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was important</font>

59
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:35,180
to share with you some of the comments

60
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,790
that your colleagues are making<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

61
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:42,680
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> event so of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course it positive ones</font>

62
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:45,019
no great<font color="#CCCCCC"> cutting-edge content relevant</font>

63
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,670
to research so that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important I</font>

64
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">think in our industry that we're</font>

65
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">bringing to you content that at least</font>

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,730
this individual felt was cutting edge

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,980
and relevant and evaluate to network

68
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,280
with current clients at a reasonable

69
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,518
cost really important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that we can</font>

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,650
deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to you at a reasonable cost</font>

71
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,780
so anyways just a sampling that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

72
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,269
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this data we really really do</font>

73
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:15,430
review it and summarize it so if you

74
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:18,859
haven't shared your comments please do

75
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,530
at this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce some</font>

76
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:25,370
folks who participate in our NCI program

77
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:29,480
again leading into that research and

78
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:38,180
education track that's part of nanog and

79
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:41,569
speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the future Kevin better have</font>

80
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:48,250
someone who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually delivering come</font>

81
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:48,250
up and speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you thanks Betty</font>

82
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,290
so Betty asked me to come up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak</font>

83
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:00,280
for a few minutes about the nanocollege

84
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:02,590
immersion program and I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font>

85
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">up and spend that few minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telling</font>

86
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,020
you what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that program is and describing</font>

87
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:11,679
the problem statement of what we're

88
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,560
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve with this program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">been coming to nanog semi-regularly for</font>

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,970
18 years working for profit

91
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,030
organizations currently for Netflix

92
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,460
which is great by the way but I'm going

93
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hat off and put on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

94
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,840
academic at specifically for the

95
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,950
University of Colorado where I've been

96
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,969
teaching for 15 years in the

97
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">interdisciplinary telecommunications</font>

98
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:43,660
master's program kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mouthful in</font>

99
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,840
that program I teach a course that

100
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,470
focuses on things like how the internet

101
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,049
works how bgp works the economics and

102
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,690
politics of peering and deep urine I

103
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,690
might know a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about that and</font>

104
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,350
during that that time what I've seen

105
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,280
especially in the last few years is that

106
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,990
network engineering the network

107
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:15,099
operations is not as sexy as it was when

108
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:17,530
I started things that are sexy for

109
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:21,970
students are applications development

110
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,859
for smartphones and tablets designing

111
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:28,140
products that work in or around<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

112
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,140
through the cloud whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is and</font>

113
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately they're working towards being</font>

114
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,590
the director of<font color="#E5E5E5"> business development</font>

115
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,790
somewhere although I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually know</font>

116
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:41,650
what that role is but anyway what

117
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,600
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not finding interesting is</font>

118
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,669
network engineering and netops and I

119
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,270
think it's no surprise to anyone here

120
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,620
that filling those roles at your

121
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,010
company's is getting increasingly

122
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:57,160
difficult the pool is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller</font>

123
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:59,349
the demand is getting larger and we just

124
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">need more bodies and that's where the</font>

125
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,580
college immersion program

126
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:07,099
I'm really comes into play what we think

127
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,859
what we've been working towards is

128
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,290
taking a handful of students from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

129
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">handful of institutions bringing them</font>

130
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:18,710
here to nanog and showing them that this

131
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> industry that they can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

132
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,150
a have a great career a place<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we</font>

133
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,580
have really hard problems to solve and

134
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,799
really innovative technologies to apply

135
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:32,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to those problems and we need smart</font>

136
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:36,800
people to come help us solve that so far

137
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,530
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like it's working we've had had</font>

138
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,810
this run in 44 nanog since Nanak 63 we

139
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:45,890
brought 41 students from four different

140
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,840
institutions to the last four nanog or

141
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:57,080
at least collectively to the last four

142
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:59,989
damage and from what I've observed the

143
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,460
first time the allocations that I

144
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,530
received for the University of Colorado

145
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,180
I had trouble filling them I had trouble

146
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:08,750

build for the future so thank you for

226
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:37,998
<font color="#CCCCCC">being patient it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of our</font>

227
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:40,359
traditional closing but I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

228
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:44,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things going on</font>

229
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:48,410
aetna knob besides just our conference

230
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,749
so with that said here's some statistics

231
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,240
my usual statistics which will post

232
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:56,149
probably in a couple weeks and summarize

233
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,720
this meeting in in more detail but we

234
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:02,209
had 1079 folks that actually picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font>

235
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,429
badge and checked in which means this is

236
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:06,429
the second largest nanog meeting ever

237
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:18,498
and certainly the largest meeting in

238
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:21,350
February there were 900 scuze me 808

239
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:23,480
folks here that were non-members so I

240
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,220
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly encourage those 800</font>

241
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,100
folks to consider the value proposition

242
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:31,579
of becoming a member so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be part</font>

243
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:34,100
of growing nanog just not you know just

244
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:36,739
being in the the meeting intended space

245
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,449
but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay too member registration</font>

246
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,660
there were only two hundred and

247
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:44,839
seventy-one we have I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I</font>

250
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,189
be interesting to see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that changed</font>

from the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the meeting</font>

put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presentation material</font>

we had 12 college version students

264
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,520
officially and the last number important

265
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,040
I think to all of us is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the increase</font>

266
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:42,230
awareness of female attendants<font color="#CCCCCC"> inner</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">industry or in our industry so ten</font>

268
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:48,040

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:51,530
female representation at an A&R meeting

270

301
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,120
is we have a lot of diversity in our

302
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:40,319
population but our core is still

303

that we can do the kind of quality work

331
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:18,880
throughout the year and specifically at

332
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:21,910
nanog 66 there's sponsors within our

333

community<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not able to make the</font>

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,990
take individual meeting sponsorship

337
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:34,389
opportunities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to share with</font>

340
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:42,519
sponsorship model is not like a

traditional exhibit or event activity

342
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,990
that most marketing departments

343
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:49,600
participate in so all of the engineers

344
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,420
in the room that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to convince</font>

for being here save the dates nanog on

350
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,199
the road is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back this year even</font>

351
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:21,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">though the website doesn't have specific</font>

352
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:24,939
specific dates we are in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process of</font>

353
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:27,699
securing locations but if you don't see

354
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:31,150
a site on this list that you would like

355
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:33,460
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider contact me a little</font>

356
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,530
formatting issue there but these are the

357
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,500
cities<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're planning on going to</font>

358
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,928
so keep them in mind in those months as

359
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,080
we publish the actual dates and agendas

360
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:46,390
and help us promote nanog on the road by

361
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,889
bringing your junior engineers to a mini

362

nanog save the dates for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future</font>

363
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,850
nanog conferences<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not only</font>

364
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,980
important for your calendars so you can

365
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,030
know what's coming up

366
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:03,010
it's also important for me to show

367
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:05,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">potential hosts that want to be</font>

368
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:08,740
represented and associated with nanog

369
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,928
where there's an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if</font>

370
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,230
you talk to anyone who's hosted before

371
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:16,419
or who signed up to host there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

372
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:20,169
of value in hosting an ant on meeting

373
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:24,850
and we hope we make it easy the big one

374
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:26,860
as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> indicated on this list is nanog 67</font>

375
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,070
and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a heads up on</font>

376
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:32,770
dates it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting that we</font>

377
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,299
get even before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back to our home</font>

378
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,160
base what's coming up when's it

379
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,530
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i thought i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would share</font>

380
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,559
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what we call key dates ahead of</font>

381
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:43,350
time so you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in your mental</font>

382
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:46,178
registry when we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to open</font>

383
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,520
registration which is important because

384
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:51,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that also means we open the hotel block</font>

385
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:55,660
we release the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFP and that date as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

386
00:18:51,970 --> 00:19:00,400
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> around March 7th nan Orrock 67 will</font>

387
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:03,669
become live we publish the agenda on or

388
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,530
around May sixteenth and that is tied to

389
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:08,350
another important date that's

390
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,330
highlighted which is the room lock we

391
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,959
have secured as many rooms as we

392
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:15,879
possibly can right now in Chicago so I

393
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,669
would encourage everyone to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

394
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,280
dates and as soon is the room block is

395
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:24,010
open to start thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about attending</font>

396
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,620
and reserving your room don't wait till

397
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,990
last minute don't wait to get here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

398
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:32,530
have me try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find you a sleeping room</font>

399
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:36,820
I won't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to meet us in Chicago</font>

400
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:40,660
