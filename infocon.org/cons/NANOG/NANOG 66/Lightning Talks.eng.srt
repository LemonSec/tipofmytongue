and gear already<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have three talks</font>

free credits for ripe Atlas thanks to

the ripe folks and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the software</font>

wouldn't have been possible without the

support of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sponsors which we really</font>

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank we had large financial</font>

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:05,510
support as I mentioned earlier we assign

00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:07,220
about 33 travel grants from student to

87
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,880
students that travel from all over the

world to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the echo besides</font>

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we had plenty of experts domain</font>

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">experts some of them were from these</font>

91
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,459
organizations and it that was great for

92
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:21,200
in general for the hacker and the

93
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,410
participants could take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of</font>

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,770
help and support and advice from the

95
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,870
domain experts indeed some of them

96
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,979
actually sat down<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them and hacked</font>

97
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:37,010
and participated very focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

98
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,140
on their challenges also we had some

99
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,409
jury members that are from these

100
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,810
organizations so every presentation of a

101
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,600
hackathon needs to have a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

102
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,520
false locked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room hacking and</font>

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,040
they were really determined I mean we

104
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">had to kick them out at 11pm we didn't</font>

105
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,790
say up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the night but I have here</font>

106
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:02,540
another slide here<font color="#CCCCCC"> metin the more kindly</font>

107
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:04,610
posed for this joke which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to</font>

108
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,250
invent a tool to highlight this record

109
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,320
on differently from other academies was

110
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,470
not heavily focused on code but rather

111
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:16,400
on measurement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that analysis and so on</font>

112
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,870
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you know measurements and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

113
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,489
measurements in particular SAT kind of

114
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,350
tricky sometimes the data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as good</font>

115
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,230
as we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to sometimes it's</font>

116
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,240
incomplete sometimes experiments need

117
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,060
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be measurements we need to be</font>

118
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,070
redone and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was a good</font>

119
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,330
experience for the participants<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

120
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,040
particular for the students to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

121
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,159
more about what are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential issues</font>

122
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,600
in internet measurements and actually

123
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,580
learn about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> limitations of the state</font>

124
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,560
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> art but I think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can say also</font>

125
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,659
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually contributed to</font>

126
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,280
improving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state of the art and so</font>

127
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:52,060
here come four slides for the four

128
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,289
awarded projects from four teams

129
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the website of the hackathon</font>

130
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,460
you find tons of information about the

platforms that we use the documentation

of these platforms the attendees and of

made it possible to deploy it in also in

146
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,820
a private installation with that so this

147
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,030
system includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data collector and</font>

148
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,080
supports real-time streaming and

149
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,210
visualization and as you see there is an

150
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,830
advanced diagram that one of the

151
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,200
participants created during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

153
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,120
follow up it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pretty soon they</font>

154
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,490
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make available either a</font>

155

used with also with private data feeds

158
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,800
that you don't want to share the team

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hijacks to project instead</font>

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,290
focused on really of time live direction

161
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,510
of BGP hijacking activity in

162
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:15,120
particularly they've developed a

163
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,460
detection system for again real-time

164
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,830
detection system for moss and sub most

165
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,599
events<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they implemented rules to</font>

166
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,880
filter out by nine cases by using

167
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,060
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of data sets by using</font>

168
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:30,510
also rpki the<font color="#CCCCCC"> k'da s relationship data</font>

169
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,670
set and so on they made available their

170
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,469
source code on the github repository of

171
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,540
the hackathon but most of the

172
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,540
participants actually put the code

173
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">online the bgp stream one group was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,670
of a single person Shane<font color="#CCCCCC"> elko from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">University</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Waikato and he improved</font>

176
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,840
filtering in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp stream software</font>

177
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,840
framework in particular he developed BPF

178
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,030
style language for describing filters

179
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,140
that can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> both from common line</font>

180
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,880
and from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> python and c api is so</font>

181
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,169
basically a user can select which

182
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,540
portions of the traffic should be

183
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually processed analyzed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by a bgp</font>

184
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,670
stream application<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a nice a nice</font>

185
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,680
feature that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he implemented is the use</font>

186
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,230
of regular expressions expressions that

187
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,940
can be applied to<font color="#CCCCCC"> aes pots and actually</font>

188
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,500
this project was<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-received also by</font>

189
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,880
the other team participants<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said</font>

190
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,230
they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have used this features if</font>

191
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,600
they they were available during the

192
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,450
hacker so since this code is pretty

193
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,770
close to production quality probably

194
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,830
soon we will integrate it in the next

195
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:30,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">release of bgp stream and finally the</font>

196
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,728
anycast they are not in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

197
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:36,270
order they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were all ranked like the four</font>

198
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:37,710
top projects the anycast one project in

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,120
this project that<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't use the Bering</font>

test but from University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Southern</font>

201
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,070
California to emulate a service that

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:46,170
uses any<font color="#E5E5E5"> ghost they set up seven any gas</font>

203
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,440
nodes basically they configure seven

204
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">maxi's seven sides of the Bering testbed</font>

205
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,910
to announce chosen prefix and then they

206
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,740
use ripe Atlas probes to repeatedly

207
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">trace route to this prefix from</font>

208
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,320
different geographic location and then

209
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,810
they observed the results through

210
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,210
droughts and through the control<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane</font>

211
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,619
and on the control plane basically at a

212
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,570
certain point in the experiment what

213
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,700
they did was to shut down the most

214
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,620
popular site the one that was in

215
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:18,050
Amsterdam and they observed impact of

216
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:19,790
these changes also they visualized the

217
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,410
impact of these changes by the glow

218
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,469
individually developing a visualization

219
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:28,069
based on the d3<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript software</font>

220
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,810
framework my slides and here I really

221
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,400
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank the participants of the</font>

222
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,189
hecarim because he made it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they</font>

223
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,260
made they made an immediate a fantastic

224
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,870
event I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very collaborative</font>

225
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,630
very productive and we hope to tribute

226
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:45,490
it soon well soon we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to</font>

227
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:48,740
recover actually from it<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe next year</font>

228
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">there will it will follow a formal</font>

229
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,830
report and we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are</font>

230
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,720
working progress for blog post and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

231
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,580
post pictures and there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

232
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,710
tweets and you can find as I said plenty

233
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,710
of information on the website thanks

I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> afraid to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touch this bottle yes</font>

235
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:26,310
thank you already Jeff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

236
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:30,750
to us about zombies afternoon again some

237
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:32,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">tops are informative some are not this</font>

is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ladder and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's any</font>

information contained in this pack I

240
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:40,500
apologize in advance because it's

241
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,060
entirely unintentional I've talked a

242
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,949
little while the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times about</font>

243
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,899
what we actually do together measurement

244
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:48,899
and what we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is use an online</font>

245
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,569
advertisement this fetches the number of

246
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,699
one by one blots but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is that</font>

247
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:57,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's so much intercepting middleware</font>

248
00:10:53,699 --> 00:11:00,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS by design</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Katia's stuff web</font>

249
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,279
proxies case stuff everyone wants to

250
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,649
hang on to things and shortcut the

251
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,230
answer but I want to see what you're

252
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:08,970
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the only way I can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

253
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,550
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these ads actually</font>

254
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:16,620
load up the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> with completely</font>

255
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:18,930
unique URL labels so we do this around

256
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,850
four million times a day so we do a fair

257
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,300
deal of just shunting out onto the

258
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet unique labels all the time</font>

259
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,849
inside these ads and so we generate

260
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,889
around 12 million DNS queries for these

261
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,920
unique names and we generate around 12

262
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:38,339
million there are unique URL fetches per

263
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,620
day you might do the same to I<font color="#CCCCCC"> make this</font>

264
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:47,459
way internet works right so unique

265
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:49,680
unique means exactly what it says when

266
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:51,388
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the privilege of getting one of</font>

267
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,888
these ads and for God's sake<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't click</font>

268
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:58,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">on it the URL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside that ad is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

269
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:00,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">you only you got it no one else will</font>

270
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,720
ever get it no one else ever got it in

271
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:08,149
the past it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your single</font>

273
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:13,829
so it's kind of don't learn this crap

274
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:17,490
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not worth remembering the URL fetch</font>

275
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:19,260
once so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

276
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:23,550
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the authoritative name server</font>

277
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:29,390
and I'm the HTTP thing I should see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

278
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:32,189
once just once so I get these in my logs

279
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah right Whoopi do these a date</font>

280
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,660
timestamp so this was collected on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

281
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,420
fifteenth of December and those are a

282
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,490
collection of unique URLs and just to

283
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure I knew what I was doing I put</font>

284
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,839
the time of<font color="#E5E5E5"> creation as part of the</font>

285
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,130
unique string label and you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

286
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:53,850
time there i decoded it for you this is

287
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:55,380
a month old all of those URLs or are

288
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,830
those unique labels there were actually

289
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,170
created around a month ago it seems

290
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:04,410
there's something weird going on out

291
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:06,750
there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically there's an awful</font>

292
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,870
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of zombies going on that when you</font>

293
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:13,830
ask something of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS it never</font>

294
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:16,890
forgets and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a lot of it well</font>

295
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:19,290
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of it lets us do a graph and</font>

296
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply some science to the problem what's</font>

297
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,959
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> age distribution of these zombies is</font>

298
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:28,339
it all just our last week last month the

299
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:34,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">axis down the bottom is days 200 days</font>

300
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:37,020
300 days 600 days three years so when

301
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:41,490
the DNS never forgets it<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly never</font>

302
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:44,910
ever ever ever ever forgets that was one

303
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:48,240
server that's 60,000 sitting one of my

304
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,310
servers the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average time well if you</font>

305
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,589
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it that's all the servers and</font>

306
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,329
you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that fifty percent of</font>

307
00:13:52,589 --> 00:14:00,740
these zombies are actually six months

308
00:13:54,329 --> 00:14:04,290
old what's wrong with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys forget it</font>

309
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:07,860
just forget it right you don't need to

310
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:10,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">hang on to DNS it's all crap do not</font>

311
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,110
remember this stuff when there's a TTL

312
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:17,790
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one second believe it that's the time</font>

313
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:19,680
to live kill it no no oh no fifty

314
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,089
percent are more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than six months old and</font>

315
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,890
there's a trailing edge out there at

316
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:25,829
heating three years when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I first started</font>

317
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this so I look at the number of</font>

318
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:30,498
repeats per day some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

319
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,629
obsessively compulsively we

320
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:35,269
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one person out there that</font>

321
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:37,189
queries the same dead<font color="#CCCCCC"> named dead name</font>

322
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:42,859
three time once every three seconds

323
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:45,858
forever it's gone no one ever wants it

324
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:49,759
forget it you look at this distribution

325
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:51,559
and you know up the top there two-thirds

326
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,479
of all queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> occur only once a day but</font>

327
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,368
the rest of you no no no<font color="#E5E5E5"> once is not</font>

328
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:58,399
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just keep hammering away the</font>

329
00:14:55,369 --> 00:15:01,759
answer might change<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the answer will</font>

330
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,549
never change and be no one bloody wants

331
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,399
the answer anyway right you didn't need

332
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:10,218
to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go but hang</font>

333
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,279
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second is it because you guys run</font>

334
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:15,889
deranged dns and you might will run

335
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,199
deranged<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns what do I know or an actual</font>

336
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:20,629
fact it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the DNS s fault the DNS is</font>

337
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:23,358
being very nice you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running deranged</font>

338
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:26,419
web proxies where the red proxy says

339
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:28,909
that one by one gift that transparent

340
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:31,009
gif is subtly different from all of the

341
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:33,259
other billions of instances of that one

342
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:36,199
by one gift I need to keep on refreshing

343
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:38,359
that one yeah so I thought well<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

344
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,128
look at the instance of URL zombies who

345
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:43,279
knows it might be the same there might

346
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:45,529
be a fingerprint here the web is<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird</font>

347
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,379
but differently weird you notice that

348
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:50,149
age distribution is a certain set there

349
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:52,939
that just never ever ever forgets but

350
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:55,689
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different to the DNS fifty percent</font>

351
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:59,419
of URL zombies are only four days<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

352
00:15:55,689 --> 00:16:01,309
somehow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs the web caches have</font>

353
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:04,970
learned the fact that you can forget

354
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:07,129
stuff it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but the DNS the</font>

355
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,470
obsessive compulsives out there and you

356
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:12,259
know who you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just will not forget</font>

357
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,779
the DNS the zombie repeats are different

358
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:18,799
the patterns are different so there's

359
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:21,979
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird about the DNS every time</font>

360
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,989
you make a query that query gets placed

361
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:27,949
into the repeat forever bucket and

362
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:30,079
there's this garbage tip of all dns

363
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:32,959
queries that we're leaving<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind us and</font>

364
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,998
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your dns authoritative server</font>

365
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,909
is going churn sure insured it's not

366
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:39,799
real demand nothing like that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

367
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:44,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the or resolvers just never ever</font>

368
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:47,540
ever forget but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use this</font>

369
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:51,560
I'm applying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for new gtld name called</font>

370
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,260
storage and and the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> your right to</font>

371
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,030
this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite easy you just ask</font>

372
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,790
the same query a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> times and then</font>

373
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:01,250
that's it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS will never ever forget</font>

374
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,660
that query so you put in an index value

375
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,069
which is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how to get it</font>

376
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">back and use write the data as part of</font>

377
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:08,359
the query done right so once you write

378
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,579
it in how do you read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just wait</font>

379
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:12,859
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just listen and it'll come back to</font>

380
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,439
you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know sooner or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later that query</font>

381
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:17,949
come up I remember it now there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

382
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">one minor problem with my idea however I</font>

383
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:24,340
can never<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever ever delete the bloody</font>

384
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,340
stuff thank you

385
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I doing this okay I guess um</font>

386
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:56,169
I'm in ways young I'm from University of

387
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:01,150
Oregon and the center of cyber security

388
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:04,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and privacy so in this like condition we</font>

389
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:07,900
like to introduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to our most recent</font>

390
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:10,000
research efforts in terms of defensive

391
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,490
details so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a collaborative work</font>

392
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,560
with my advisor generally and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lomi sure</font>

393
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,500
that we can see Sylvia Elizabeth

394
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:22,360
Elizabeth fuller and our code wiser

395
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:24,130
Peter river from UCLA so but we have a

396
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,669
fancy<font color="#E5E5E5"> name called drawbridge right we</font>

397
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:30,400
want this project to be really effective

398
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:33,490
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a job which we commend it and it was</font>

399
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">um level up and then no traffic should</font>

400
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,970
go and of course Tito's traffic so let's

401
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,100
go ahead of course um we elect first

402
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,520
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Homeland Security for a funny</font>

403
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:49,750
let's project and so let's talk about

404
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,940
problem statement so we all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like d</font>

405
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,700
dos attacks are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a serious problem and we</font>

406
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to rehearse really enforce</font>

407
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,830
this concept anymore but saudi-led

408
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,680
attacks are performed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by sending large</font>

409
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,270
one of garbage packets or even<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

410
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,620
seemingly not garbage packets with your

411
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:10,930
targets so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem of the current</font>

412
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,000
attacks or their victims are sometimes

413
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,740
really small or medium sized

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,260
organizations that they don't have this

415
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,890
resources to resend a very very large t

416
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:24,820
dos attack so some companies like seek

417
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,830
help from cloud medication services and

418
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,730
some companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying to just build</font>

419
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:34,120
bigger pipes to whistle the attacks by

420
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:37,870
themselves however like we look at this

421
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,300
problem differently so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were when</font>

422
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,729
the victim under a dealer<font color="#CCCCCC"> does attack or</font>

423
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">any other energy does attack so the</font>

424
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,320
victim should have the perfect knowledge

425
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,780
of what is the package or what are the

426
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">packs that they want to have or what are</font>

427
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,260
the package that they want they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

428
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,210
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have so like</font>

429
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous solutions were like most of</font>

430
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,860
the perfect solutions that we know the

431
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,159
details victims<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sending a binary</font>

434
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,720
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring more to the state we want</font>

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,820
the victim to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit a little</font>

436
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,360
bit more knowledgeable about the attacks

437
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:20,840
and tell more to those as<font color="#E5E5E5"> peace that</font>

438
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,719
they are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with so why why the</font>

439
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,820
usps wiper<font color="#CCCCCC"> want more information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

440
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,440
because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealer's that the eyes peas</font>

441
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,080
are the ones that are really<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

442
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">drop packets or doing something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about an</font>

443
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,210
attack if the ISPs are more informed

444
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:38,870
about the attack and as we could do a

445
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:42,140
better job and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> why is peace because</font>

446
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:45,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want this knowledge about the text to</font>

447
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,330
be propagated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to more places to even</font>

448
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,629
further down two down the road to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

449
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:54,500
attacks roses to the weird attack is

450
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:56,960
from so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> it becomes how do</font>

451
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,640
we effectively get these customers

452
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,880
knowledge about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tea dos attack and</font>

453
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,650
their needs their traffic needs to the

454
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:08,360
ESPYs that who can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> act on don't</font>

455
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:11,540
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest basic idea of drawbridge</font>

456
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:15,169
is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to enable users and</font>

457
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:18,110
users of course the potential victims to

458
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:20,660
inform the eyes fees or guesses who can

459
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:26,030
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> handle the attack about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

460
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:28,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">does and we utilize as the end</font>

461
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:32,770
infrastructure to be able to effectively

462
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:34,970
handle those details attacks so as our

463
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,190
prototype implementation we're using

464
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,230
open flow based software different

465
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,580
working but of course like all<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

466
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:45,170
kinds of software different<font color="#E5E5E5"> knocking is</font>

467
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:49,639
able to filtering any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those attacks</font>

468
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:52,250
and eventually drove with our product

469
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,100
product or research project we would

470
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,620
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change the chain we like to push</font>

471
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,290
the change of traffic engineering by

472
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,870
incorporating the needs from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the users</font>

473
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,820
and injecting more knowledge from the

474
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ESPYs who are doing the</font>

475
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,639
traffic engineering

476
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,950
and so drawbridge enables the perp of

477
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,400
course enables the propagation of this

478
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,760
details filtering rules to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> firm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

479
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,460
customer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs and between the ISPs so</font>

480
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,640
we want this knowledge to be propagated

481
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:29,090
to as far as possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ultimately</font>

482
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,289
stop the traffic if we can just right

483
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:36,080
outside the attacker sources so here's

484
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:38,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">the example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of how this system that we</font>

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:45,470
would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see words of course it's a</font>

486
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:49,070
simple diagram so first the user on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:52,429

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:55,428
potential victims SP and the victim sit

489
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:58,940
here is the machine that on the most far

490
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:01,340
right and this user can subscribe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

491
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,220
this drovic to average system which job

492
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:08,120
a service that a nice p can provide or

493
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:11,140
other as we can provide so during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

494
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,780
attack the customer send out traffic or

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,070
findra traffic filtering rules which

496
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:20,090
describes what kind of traffic we don't

497
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:23,120
want so as a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> example when my</font>

498
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:25,039
personal web server is under like ntp

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,139
amplification amplification attack I

500
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,740
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that I don't want this</font>

501
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:36,440
type of traffic I do I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the my</font>

502
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:38,059
isp to run complicated services to learn

503
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,400
what type of traffic issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font>

504
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just want to tell my speed don't do</font>

505
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,500
this anymore just kill all those ntp

506
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:48,678
traffic so what you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is that the</font>

507
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,510
sort of the customer or this unhealthy

508
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,850
will send out traffic or send our

509
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,590
traffic filtering rules directly to the

510
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,039
service provider with robert service

511
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:01,100
provider and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's OSP and the drawer by</font>

00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:04,070
service partner tries to deploy at their

513
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:08,090
own infrastructure of course but all

514
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:10,250
these the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is too large like give</font>

515
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:13,070
hundreds of gigabytes per second since

516
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:16,309
giveaways per second soon under this

517

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get some help from others</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what we</font>

519
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:23,370
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is that we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to enable</font>

520
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:27,000
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> collaboration between is peace so</font>

521
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:30,179
that this is p2 or the victims<font color="#CCCCCC"> is B can</font>

522
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,240
call for help and firm is p1 which they

523
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:37,200
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just act for their customer in</font>

524
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,110
terms of ISP or a s so that the traffic

525
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,320
sent from the ISP one could be also

526
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:46,530
filtered out so in this case when you

527
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:50,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">enable this collaborative difference not</font>

528
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:52,170
only in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the and health and its</font>

529
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:57,510
own provider by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider and</font>

530
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:59,280
providers so the main efforts we won't

531
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,310
push on is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to create this</font>

532
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,649
chain of<font color="#E5E5E5"> communication so that there is</font>

533
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:07,379
a lot of chain of communication can be

534
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:10,830
established and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Swiss</font>

535
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:14,940
could add together to defense against de

536
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:17,010
las attack so in this project we're

537
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,630
looking at several different aspects

538
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:23,070
inside how how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we build this</font>

539
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,900
drawbridge system so the first one is

540
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identify what's the best</font>

541
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,900
strategy of forming this collaboration

542
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,240
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first place we can just rely on</font>

543
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,280
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will entirely just to join</font>

544
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,980
this project and the filter our traffic

545
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,720
for their customer it may lose money by

546
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,780
doing that or it may cause other

547
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,780
problems which is naturally a problem to

548
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:48,870
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and say we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

549
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:51,540
collaboration set<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to set a set up</font>

550
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:53,429
then we also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discover what's the</font>

551
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,430
best locations for deploying featuring

552
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:58,140
rules say we have 113 rules we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

553
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,530
want to deploy at all the on

554
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,330
internet which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a waste of resources</font>

555
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:07,620
also could be incurred a lot of the

556
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:09,750
economic<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs and we want to optimize</font>

557
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,620
the roof space throughout all the

558
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:16,740
rubbish nodes to reduce overhead of this

<font color="#CCCCCC">de dos de</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fencing services on there is</font>

560
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,480
peace around the RAS infrastructure so

561
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:27,330
that it will incur too much overhead or

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:30,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">even affect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your operation and at last</font>

563
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:32,699
we want to motivate a space to

participate here<font color="#E5E5E5"> one say that</font>
