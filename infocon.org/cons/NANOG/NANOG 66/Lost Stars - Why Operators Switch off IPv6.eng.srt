1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:10,480
excellent next up we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Emile even</font>

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:19,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">from ripe talking a little bit more</font>

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">about these six and why it goes away hi</font>

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:27,280
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part two of two of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ers</font>

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,750
talking about ipv6 so this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a my</font>

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,630
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Emil urban I work for the ripe</font>

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,809
NCC so another AR AR and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stars so it's about why operators</font>

9
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:41,890
switch of ipv6 which is what we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:44,260
little survey on and this actually is

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,150
not my work this is work from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:51,280
of excellent colleagues I have nately or

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:55,210
ip6 program manager on and Renee so I'm

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,200
just a talking head here so a little bit

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:05,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">of background and I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:06,909
first diagram of really simplified how

17
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:08,590
you enable ipv6 you get your address

18
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:10,570
space I mean and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are points that</font>

19
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,890
you can actually measure at get it

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,970
routed getting used so for the last part

21
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,070
get it used there's a lot of

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,990
measurements out there just showed some

23
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,460
at at five percent i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you</font>

24
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,408
the other one which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have probably</font>

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:28,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">all seen at least hundred times who</font>

26
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:31,330
hasn't seen this graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so google says</font>

27
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:36,610
ten percent of their end users jeff says

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:37,810
five percent if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the content</font>

29
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,540
side of things if you look at their like

30
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,930
sub 1 million there's five percent so

31
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:48,520
that's where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are at and if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

32
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:51,460
at ip6 at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoints so one thing we</font>

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:56,470
actually do at the ripe NCC is looking

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:59,500
at so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the routing level so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we take</font>

35
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:02,530
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs that we collect in our routing</font>

36
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,340
information system and look which<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones</font>

37
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:08,519
what percentage has an ipv6 one or more

38
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,579
ip6 prefixes and if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

39
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:15,370
yellow line here that's the global so

40
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:16,470
you see we're currently at twenty-three

41
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,640
percent

42
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're so that's y a higher number and</font>

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,000
because we're in the North American

44
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,920
region here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also have the North</font>

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,500
America region plot here and that's also

46
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting line you see to Chang</font>

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">Drake's here actually first one was</font>

48
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:43,080
around ipv6 day people working towards

49
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:46,200
that and I was getting and after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,880
did it tailed off a bit and the other

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,030
one with that's really interesting which

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">is where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this region appeared to wake up</font>

53
00:02:53,030 --> 00:03:02,730
and the v4 pull the people drained here

54
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,359
and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that was probably a</font>

55
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:10,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">good indication of getting a network</font>

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:14,090
ready at least and routing for ipv6 so

57
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,230
this is kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the latent</font>

58
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,900
capability of ipv6 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people that</font>

59
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:22,018
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually done stuff and</font>

60
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:26,760
routing already maybe not brought it to

61
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:29,160
the end point yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back also to</font>

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,440
early deployment we have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

63
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,739
we call ipv6 ripeness and the pun is

64
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">intended there it's a rating system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

65
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:41,209
measure early signs of ipv6 deployment

66
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,850
so we basically give a give out stars

67
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:47,250
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for things where we see early signs</font>

68
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,380
of ip6 deploying the first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font>

69
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,959
does an organization have an ipv6

70
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,079
allocation from us that's a simple thing

71
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:59,209
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> your very first step and we have</font>

72
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,019
three more one is a are you routing it

73
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:04,200
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other two are more</font>

74
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:09,030
administrative like being nice being

75
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">have your administration up to speed so</font>

76
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a route</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six objects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and reverse DNS</font>

77
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,330
set up and there's a URL therefore if

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,209
you if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

79
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:21,780
it looks like in our region that's the

80
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,390
current status we have over 12,000

81
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,909
members la ours which what we call them

82
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,789
only twenty-four percent has not done

83
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,680
anything in ipv4 so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

84
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:33,630
bit of a deceiving number but I'll get

85
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,410
to that later twenty one<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent have</font>

86
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,270
done all four of these indicators and

87
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,500
why it's a bit deceiving is because it's

88
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:46,380
thirty percent for quite a long while to

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:49,260
get the last piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 address space</font>

90
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,700
from our last / aids that we had that

91
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,599
you actually had to get an ipv6

92
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:57,030
allocation from us so the people who

93
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:59,460
wanted that last / 22 of ipv4 had

94
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,880
together ipv6 allocation so that

95
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,979
requirement got removed in March so but

96
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,800
that's why this number may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a bit</font>

97
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:11,580
bigger than it then it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

98
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,310
is people also wanted us to look at

99
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:19,080
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> live e6 deployment just not</font>

100
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,970
signs for for the early steps and that's

101
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,469
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have what we call a fifth star</font>

102
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,950
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> measuring the actual deployment</font>

103
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for we define a threshold at what</font>

104
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:31,530
percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 deployment do you get</font>

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,840
this star and we do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for two</font>

106
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,429
categories for content networks for

107
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,310
access networks access networks is

108
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,780
actually the data from a panic that Jeff

109
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,720
was talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're very grateful</font>

110
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the Jeff in Georgia a panic for</font>

111
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,720
providing the data for content networks

112
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,090
we look at the Alexa<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million and see</font>

113
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,020
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of these sites</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are hosted in</font>

114
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:57,299
each of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> li RS and what percentage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

115
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:02,880
ipv6 enabled so if you're over a certain

116
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:04,500
threshold you get this fifth star and we

117
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,740
give people t-shirts for that and it's

118
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing what I what about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a motivator</font>

119
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,590
something simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a t-shirt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

120
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:15,900
is because for instance in our training

121
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,549
team if the people go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to give an</font>

122
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,250
artistic straining

123
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,440
they make little ceremony around<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

124
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,790
this fifth star or not people getting

125
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">t-shirts and people getting quite</font>

126
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,430
excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually actual deployment</font>

127
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:32,250
of ipv6 at the sixty percent threshold

128
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:37,950
we currently have five point six percent

129
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:39,360
of our layers having this fifth star but

130
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,520
there's also things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not going</font>

131
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">so well and Jeff pointed out some things</font>

132
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,330
they're already in doing all these

133
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,790
statistics there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we</font>

134
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:56,340
noticed is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some people it you</font>

135
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:58,230
usually get used<font color="#E5E5E5"> the black arrows here</font>

136
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,200
in your ipv6 deployment what we actually

137
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">saw was people doing that red arrow</font>

138
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:10,560
there so they had their ipv6 routed and

139
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:13,350
they stopped<font color="#CCCCCC"> riding it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so um Natalie</font>

140
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,810
when she saw these numbers thought so

141
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,570
what's what's going on here are these

142
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,450
false starts what what's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people</font>

143
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,400
doing here and we can conjecture

144
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:26,310
conjuncture a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's actually</font>

145
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,560
happening there but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Natalie decided</font>

146
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:33,230
to actually ask them so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

147
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:36,390
guys doing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so is 462 people 462</font>

148
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:39,990
registries she contacted<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up neck on</font>

149
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:43,440
the tech contacts for them and received

150
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:47,130
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of responses and a lot of</font>

151
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,110
direct email sent to her telling more of

152
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:52,460
the back stories and that's that's what

153
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,460
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna kind of present here about</font>

154
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,469
first things he did was actually look at

155
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:03,540
where these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are so if you know I</font>

156
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:08,000
so country codes there at the bottom GP

157
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:11,250
is UK but that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iso code</font>

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,010
russia and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> uk's stand out a bit</font>

159
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,680
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's also where we have a lot of</font>

160
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:22,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">offer members so that's it's not there's</font>

161
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:24,780
no clear regional signal here so on to

162
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,050
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual survey that the Natalie</font>

163
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,390
did first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question we asked was are you</font>

164
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware he previously announced your IP</font>

165
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,030
allocation to the global routing table

166
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,770
luckily a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually knew</font>

167
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:42,299
that they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this some people</font>

168
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:44,189
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> no and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably because we</font>

169
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:48,300
asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong people that's that's</font>

170
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:50,190
what we figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second question what</font>

171
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,170
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purpose of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually doing</font>

172
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and a lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said ah this</font>

173
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,990
was just for testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

174
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:04,430
people said this was for production and

175
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:08,670
it's so these 16 17 answers we actually

176
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:13,380
saw that what production ipv6 settings

177
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:15,180
where people actually removed their IP

178
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,590
physics from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table and the</font>

179
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,109
rest didn't know that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

180
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:23,880
same as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nose from the first question</font>

181
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,160
third question what were your

182
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,320
experiences during the announcement so

183
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,810
the vast majority here says we actually

184
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,110
had no problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's that's that's</font>

185
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,410
a nice actually software issues hardware

186
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,060
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing issue security issues and</font>

187
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:44,880
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very little customer complaints as</font>

188
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:47,040
you can see here so there's some some

189
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,560
details here's where people could send

190
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,740
us some commands in it was only a test

191
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:58,709
we had actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a test customer and</font>

192
00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:01,710
had a but they didn't have a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

193
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:04,170
ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test it hardware</font>

194
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,330
software people<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out that it need</font>

195
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,979
actually needed other equipment or

196
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,310
needed to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in the</font>

197
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and some people reported that</font>

198
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:16,890
well we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this nice ipv6 set up now</font>

199
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:21,990
but we have no means of documenting what

200
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:23,760
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually did this one is an</font>

201
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,700
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> one where the networking</font>

202
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,920
team was really excited about ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

203
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">was was doing it and then a software</font>

204
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:36,589
team said well we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do this</font>

205
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:40,320
ipv6 not supported in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> country that</font>

206
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:41,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">was I'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to that later because</font>

207
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,649
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really interesting</font>

208
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">back story</font>

209
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:48,920
and the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one here is a main engineer</font>

210
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:51,480
left that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a euphemism for</font>

211
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:56,189
what was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> survey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

212
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,889
main engineer passed away it's it's it's

213
00:10:56,189 --> 00:11:01,199
it's it's it's a sad story of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course on</font>

214
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:03,119
a personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> level but also if you</font>

215
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:05,579
abstract away from the personal level

216
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:09,689
that there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> single person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

217
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:12,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">single person leaves your ipv6</font>

218
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:15,029
deployment gets stuck so makes me wonder

219
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:17,040
how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ipv6 deployment is actually</font>

220
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:19,499
driven by a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> person in</font>

221
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:25,379
organization like a evangelists really

222
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:27,899
driving it versus<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody in next</font>

223
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:32,129
question why did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you disable your ipv6</font>

224
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:33,779
announcement well it was just a test and

225
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:37,170
there was a we sorted in previous

226
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:39,389
question already restructuring hardware

227
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,670
issues change of isp no customer demand

228
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:44,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the political issues so that's</font>

229
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:48,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually where where I p6 is not</font>

230
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:51,389
supported in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my country that this two</font>

231
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:56,189
sides of the same coin and bankruptcy so

232
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:58,769
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go bust and yeah then you</font>

233
00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:00,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do about 56 anymore so for the</font>

234
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,679
political issue there was actually two

235
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:03,959
countries that were single out in this

236
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,600
and I won't name the countries but I'll

237
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:10,128
describe the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation's their first</font>

238
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,350
country had a sort of a centralized

239
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,699
national telco everybody had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

240
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,059
through them to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> international</font>

241
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:20,040
connectivity and they didn't do ipv6 so

242
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,589
the downstream networks figured out hey

243
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,839
if we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can do tunneling</font>

244
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:27,990
well timing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is bad but well we at least</font>

245
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have something right turns out this</font>

246
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:35,249
country is also under sanctions and

247
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:38,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tunnel providers at least the people</font>

248
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:40,860
local thoughts either no providers

249
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,389
stopped providing them services or

250
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,540
somebody was mucking with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

251
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:46,949
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a consequence tunnel provider</font>

252
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,819
don't work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that country anymore so</font>

253
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:53,279
ipv6 is not supported other country had

254
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,040
very strict data retention laws for you

255
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,769
click

256
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,810
act actually say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things to to</font>

257
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:00,550
the local government about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what people</font>

258
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:05,500
were doing and that system<font color="#E5E5E5"> just didn't</font>

259
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:09,729
support ipv6 very well so that's issues

260
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:12,279
that that are still out there so a

261
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:16,569
couple of comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people had no</font>

262
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:18,430
interest from customers so that implies

263
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:23,079
that people were waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for</font>

264
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:25,239
customer demand for ipv6 just testing so

265
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:29,769
getting you're getting your feet wet on

266
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,000
ipv6 people wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get ready and some</font>

267
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,529
switched it off until they actually

268
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,600
needed it network infrastructure change

269
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,519
so some people did some restructuring on

270
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,709
the network and ipv6 was just the last

271
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,459
thing on their list to actually reenable

272
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:49,029
again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move to different ipv6</font>

273
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:53,170
ranges is another thing we're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

274
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:55,300
maybe a more valid reason their hardware

275
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:59,800
security issues some people were really

276
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:01,540
specific in this was this was was was

277
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,349
blocking us from from actually doing

278
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,029
ipv6 in earnest second one hears is I

279
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,589
find quite interesting we were under a

280
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,180
huge DDoS attack all the time

281
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:14,019
unfortunately this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an anonymous</font>

282
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:18,160
survey so we we couldn't follow up with

283
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:20,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">this person I'm unaware of v6 being</font>

284
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,329
specifically targeted for four large

285
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,209
photometric attacks but maybe people

286
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,279
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other data can can tell me</font>

287
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,930
otherwise what I think might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

288
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,529
actually happened here is that they were

289
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,380
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> D does and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just turned off all</font>

290
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:37,480
non-essential services there and some

291
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,519
people did some stress testing and they

292
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,910
had a router that did ipv6 in software

293
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,560
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just didn't survive the service</font>

294
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,829
provider issues issues with tunnel rogue

295
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,779
or tunnel broker<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already talked about</font>

296
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:53,560
the service provider was just search

297
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:56,259
providers that don't do ipv6 in 2015

298
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,339
that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survey was so it still</font>

299
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:02,110
exists some people actually did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

300
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,480
realize they their announcements were

301
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,810
had stopped so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were aware they were</font>

302
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,370
doing ipv6 they just know

303
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:12,779
it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work anymore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that that begs</font>

304
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the question is there a need for better</font>

305
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:18,570
monitoring tools and this is also the

306
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:21,510
the other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things like happy</font>

307
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,250
eyeballs so now with happy eyeballs your

308
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:29,100
customers don't complain anymore which

309
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:33,089
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing but it also makes ipv6</font>

310
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,320
problems less visible so is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

311
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,060
better is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a need for better</font>

312
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,779
monitoring tools there that's a it's an

313
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:43,079
open question somebody asked us to

314
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:45,420
actually a sneak this question in did

315
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,820
you also stopped your ipv6 ipv4

316
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,319
announcements and some people said yes

317
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:55,770
and that was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that also</font>

318
00:15:49,320 --> 00:16:00,570
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> bankrupt so not surprising but the</font>

319
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:04,760
majority did not stop doing ipv4 so when

320
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:08,520
will you announce your ipv6 prefix again

321
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,680
don't know was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what most people</font>

322
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,910
answered so it's it there was no

323
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:17,280
specific plan to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something</font>

324
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:20,040
in a few weeks that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> encouraging in a</font>

325
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,699
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> three months but nobody said two</font>

326
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,040
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Never so it's not that people</font>

327
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:32,180
were permanently or felt permanently

328
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:35,689
blocked on anything so we got a lot of

329
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:38,250
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry we fixed it</font>

330
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:44,430
so we were basically they're monitoring

331
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:47,820
tool some said oh yeah we will return

332
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:51,719
resources for for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that</font>

333
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:56,100
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using again when a customer</font>

334
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:59,780
wants it again that implies customer

335
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:04,410
demand and some people actually said

336
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:06,480
this depends on on our upstream provider

337
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,270
so an upstream provider that didn't do

338
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,770
ipv6 so they it couldn't do anything

339
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:15,990
there the last question that we asked is

340
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,400
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can the ripened see help</font>

341
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,849
have an ipv6 program manager so we're

342
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,650
really wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help people getting</font>

343
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:27,208
the issues with ipv6 out of the way and

344
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,070
there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ideas here provide</font>

345
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,470
more training tips for addressing plans

346
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:34,080
pointers from best practices and discuss

347
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,300
ipv6 with governments we have a website

348
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're ipv6 act now that has some of</font>

349
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,830
the the addressing plan things pointers

350
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,750
there and pointers for best practices

351
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:48,570
but we've taken notice of death at this

352
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,200
and in as far as we've not been doing

353
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:57,059
this stuff already<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're we're upping</font>

354
00:17:51,200 --> 00:18:01,080
the efforts there so it's a little

355
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:03,840
summary but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Natalie it was actually</font>

356
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,939
really surprised about<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that people</font>

357
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,889
really appreciated as asking it was she

358
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a little afraid that well you're</font>

359
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:13,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at my network and you're not the</font>

360
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,449
internet police so why why do you ask

361
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:18,270
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people really like I really</font>

362
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,150
appreciate appreciated being asked about

363
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 56 deployments and happy to</font>

364
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:27,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the stuff that's</font>

365
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:29,910
there was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working yet for them seems</font>

366
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:32,220
to various<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue still and most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

367
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:36,750
are not new hardware software upstream

368
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:39,360
networks what was seen in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

369
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,640
questions is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was this lack of</font>

370
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">customer demands and that that implies</font>

371
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,820
that a customer will specifically asked

372
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:52,050
for ipv6 and maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong</font>

373
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,659
assumption right people will want a

374
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">rock-solid IP connectivity and they</font>

375
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:04,380
probably don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's v4 or v6</font>

376
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:05,730
pigeons pigs or whatever so are these

377
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,650
people waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is</font>

378
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,540
never gonna kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of going to show up I</font>

379
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,990
guess that's that's the open question

380
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:18,450
there the monitoring is missing that

381
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:21,900
that's that's people using us as their

382
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:24,630
monitoring that's I found that one is

383
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,210
interesting and since this survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

384
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,320
really focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the people in our</font>

385
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,809
service region

386
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,759
open question that we now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> is other</font>

387
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:38,379
people in this region to that had

388
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:43,149
similar issues would want to speak up on

389
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:45,399
that or so if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these issues I'd</font>

390
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:49,199
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk with you either now or in</font>

391
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:51,879
all ways or to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

392
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,499
local to our service region or if that's

393
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:58,449
if it's more global so with that that's

394
00:19:56,499 --> 00:20:08,799
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of my presentation so happy to</font>

395
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:13,059
take questions hi luili<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will google</font>

396
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:16,658
fiber<font color="#CCCCCC"> and proud um just started recently</font>

397
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:18,879
three months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah um wanted to find</font>

398
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:20,740
out when Natalie sent out the survey is

399
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:24,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">there information at the end of the</font>

400
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:27,460
survey for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean links to help</font>

401
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,590
them we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> there v6 announcements or</font>

402
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,779
just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know get over the hump for any</font>

403
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,809
of those reasons that they list it as

404
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:37,360
turning off in in the survey itself we

405
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:40,149
did not do anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but it's</font>

406
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,219
actually a good idea to if if we do more

407
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:44,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these to actually have something like</font>

408
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,389
this especially since some anonymous you

409
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,330
can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to those people so</font>

410
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:53,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">ya next time okay yep good suggestion</font>

413
00:20:56,139 --> 00:21:01,719
for your presentation it was write an

414
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:03,999
equation is how much time was the v6

415
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,619
prefix announced before you consider it

416
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:11,230
on announced yesterday no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no it was not</font>
