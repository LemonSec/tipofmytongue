know they are here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn it is</font>

76
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,459
educational but you know recruiting is

77
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,410
always fair game so have at it you know

78
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,870
vendor neutrality is a really important

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,430
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nanog our sponsors are</font>

84
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,649
sense of vendor neutrality and that's

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things about nana that</font>

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,239
being said I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recognize that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

87
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,060
do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great set of premium and</font>

88
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,160
individual meeting sponsors and you know

89
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,840
one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may notice when</font>

90
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,720
you register for nanog is the

91
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,889
registration fee is kind of low when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

92
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,709
compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to other networking</font>

93
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:58,170
conferences it's not a thousand dollars

94
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,910
it's not two thousand dollars and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

95
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,280
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why it's low and white stayed low</font>

96
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,810
for many many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is because our</font>

97
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,870
sponsors have been helping us out and we

98
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,079
really do<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so thank you</font>

sponsors

100
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:16,370
so what to expect at Nanak 66 so we are

101
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,980
arranged physically a little bit

102
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,209
different than we have been in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

103
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,709
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is that we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a few</font>

104
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,230
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> venues and some of them are</font>

105
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:27,380
outside now I know some of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends</font>

106
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,330
here saying yes i'm sorry mr. Provo some

107
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,070
of its outside there's the Sun which is

108
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,700
a large fusion reactor yellow in color

109
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,530
it it can burn us so we do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

110
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,229
careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that but the weather I've</font>

111
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,669
been told is beautiful outside so we've

112
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,980
got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of different venues what is</font>

113
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:46,099
the pavilion the pavilion is that way

114
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,350
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big white tent and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

115
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,430
we're going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our lunches and it's</font>

116
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,620
where we're going to have some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

117
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,870
other events it's pretty awesome and we

118
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,610
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it the beer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and gear is</font>

119
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,070
going to be in there and the greatest

120
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,240
thing about this space is it's huge so

121
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,240
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be crammed in like</font>

122
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,160
sardines our<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks normally we would</font>

123
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,080
have breaks in the hallway directly

124
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,510
outside the general session room as you

125
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,460
can see it's a hallway so we really

126
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to do that instead there's a</font>

127
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,630
what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they call the Bayview lon</font>

128
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,910
which is this little<font color="#E5E5E5"> park that's about</font>

129
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,700
50 feet outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the door so we're going</font>

130
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have food hi tops drinks all of that</font>

131
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,479
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on the lawn so that people</font>

132
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,039
aren't crammed into the hallway just be

133
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,010
careful of the Sun it's kind of tricky

134
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,409
other great things we have the expresso

135
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,229
bar is right outside that door for your

136
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,120
choice of caffeinated beverage we've got

137
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,849
open seating the open seating is

138
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,919
downstairs so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> floor</font>

139
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,630
there's a floor underneath there's two

140
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,039
stairwells there's an outdoor stairwell

141
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,050
right over there there's an indoor

142
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,300
stairwell right that way you can use

143
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,890

there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel network we've ever</font>

233
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,810

276
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:31,719
over the past few years quite an

277
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:33,879
enjoyable experience had had the

278
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,980
opportunity to learn a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot meet a lot of</font>

284
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:56,008
the years so I'm assuming is this button

of agree but Mary

what we do just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few months ago we</font>

00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,870
actually introduced the name console

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:11,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">have seen some of our folks hovering</font>

309
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:15,260
around some of the recent events and so

310
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,150
forth but to provide you some insight in

311
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,010
terms of how we've evolved as a company

312
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:24,470
as I mentioned we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were originally</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">founded under the name of IX but we have</font>

314
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,089
some deeper roots beyond beyond just

315
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,209
what we've accomplished<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I x over</font>

316
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:35,630
the past few years we're really a

317
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:38,209
combination of three organizations that

318
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,470
have come together through through some

319
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:42,589
acquisitions over the past couple years

320
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:45,140

accelerate our global footprint

325
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:59,450
expansion and we really look to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify</font>

326
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:02,510
organizations that were similar in many

respects to what we were doing as a

group of candidates but I'd like to

401
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:40,340
seeing the content meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> people across</font>

402
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,720
the industry really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of enriching</font>

403
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:47,129
your own social and professional network

404
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,330
so please reach out if you if you think

405
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,720
you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be interested in doing this</font>

406
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,790
because it's it's very rewarding as

407
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,820
great as downloaded there's the

408
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:59,309
guidebook that's got the agenda stuff

409
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,220
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have to refresh if changes are</font>

410
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:05,100
made to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most up-to-date stuff</font>

411
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:09,090
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a lot better than the</font>

412
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:13,649
old printed paper stuff the agenda icons

413
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:15,360
so most of the sessions will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be recorded</font>

414
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,940
and webcast there's a couple of

415
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,769
exceptions

416
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,619
we only have the ability to webcast one

417
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:24,779
thing at a time so the ones that aren't

418
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:26,999
live webcast mostly will be recorded but

419
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:29,730
again look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the the agenda and you'll</font>

420
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:34,320
see a little icon that says recorded

421
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:36,809
webcast and so forth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that</font>

422
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,330
that aren't live broadcast will be

423
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:43,559
archived in addition to the live ones

424
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:46,379
and it's a great thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube you</font>

425
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,399
know hosts all the content and and it's
