<font color="#E5E5E5">okay clickers right here and so today I</font>

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,730
am working under a double disadvantage

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,418
they put behind a puppy behind a podium

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,340
and I walk when I speak as my step

8
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:36,080
father used to say mommy mommy why am i

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,300
running around in circles shut up or

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,780
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> know your other foot to the floor</font>

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:44,300
and they won't let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me draw in the slides</font>

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,580
and I have to talk with my hands so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I</font>

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:51,680
wave my hands randomly just ignore it

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:53,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's ok so today I'm Russ why</font>

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,879
time with LinkedIn you may remember me

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,079
from other places and other times but

17
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,199
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm at LinkedIn on the</font>

18
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:03,289
architecture team doing cool stuff with

19
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:08,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">datacenter and bgp and bgp security</font>

20
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:11,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to linkedin has convinced me of or</font>

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,970
has impressed upon me the importance of

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,890
path validation and bgp security we're

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,869
an open peering company and pass

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,440
validation and beach<font color="#CCCCCC"> p security or a big</font>

25
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:22,880
deal to us so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to walk along and</font>

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,550
just talk a little bit about where we

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,860
are where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we are and I'm going</font>

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,450
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you some ideas about what I'm</font>

29
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,920
working on right now or what I have a

30
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,869
small group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on right</font>

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,869
now but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to impress on you one</font>

32
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:38,420
thing from this talk is that whether or

33
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:42,110
not we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> viable solution we need</font>

34
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,270
one because this is a big deal and it's

35
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming our way like a freight train I</font>

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,860
have some inside contacts at DHS and

37
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,530
other places and I've been told that

38
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,720
there is no government<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandate right now</font>

39
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,000
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US government to do something</font>

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,310
about bgp security but there probably

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,849
will be in some period of forthcoming

42
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,560
time and whatever system happens to be

43
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:04,970
on the block when that mandate comes

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,119
will be the system that that will be

45
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,770
mandated so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like what's on</font>

46
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,510
the block or if you think it's not

47
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,520
deployable or it's not deployable in

48
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,200
your network then the time to speak up

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,349
and do something about it or to try to

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,769
help design something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find</font>

51
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:24,540
deployable or whatever is in the now

52
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,430
rather than in the five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,989
and eight hits or whatever the time

54
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,329
frame<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I don't want to give a specific</font>

55
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:35,129
time frame I'm just making things up

56
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:37,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I did that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot by the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

57
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:38,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so we already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have origin</font>

58
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:39,480
authentication and I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

59
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to spend a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of time on these slides</font>

60
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,340
right because you already know this we

61
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,689
have the RPG I and I'm not here to tell

62
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,939
you that we should either use or not use

63
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:49,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki that's acts a decision that</font>

64
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,030
LinkedIn is going through right now is

65
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,480
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out what we do with the</font>

66
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,000
RPG I stuff so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but we all</font>

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,319
know how this works right we have a

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,549
65,000 to is authorized to advertise

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,780
some / 64 DBA 01 / 64 you should be

70
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:10,230
proud of me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm using these six</font>

71
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:12,629
addresses right I have converted all of

72
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:16,168
my writing and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my other stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

73
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,668
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> six addresses anyway 65,000 and those</font>

74
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,109
are actually the right ones to you know

75
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:20,400
I didn't use just some public space

76
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,519
those are actually the documentation

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,290
addresses so 65,000 to creates a

78
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,480
resource certificate sign with a private

79
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">key and additional parameters this is</font>

80
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,328
placed in our pikia database which is

81
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:39,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">today distributed through our sink and</font>

82
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:43,010
then when you actually look at hello

83
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:43,010
maybe not Tony ah

84
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,890
I think I actually want one<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide too</font>

85
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,560
far didn't I that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now when in</font>

86
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,290
a 65,000 receives this route<font color="#CCCCCC"> for DB 80</font>

87
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,870
once I 64 it can use the public key from

88
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RPI and it can validate the art of</font>

89
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> r-la which is countersigned by the</font>

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">ir or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nick or whatever you want to</font>

91
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,680
go into for language there and it can

92
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,299
check the origin authentication this is

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,740
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool this is useful it gives me</font>

94
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,340
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 'then authen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> origin authentication</font>

95
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,989
I'm again not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss what the</font>

96
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,760
deployments day this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think Aaron</font>

97
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:22,099
just came on board which is probably a

98
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,530
good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at what</font>

99
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,570
we're going to do with this now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

100
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,580
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cool but there are lots of</font>

101
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,980
attacks that still can happen with

102
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,789
origin authentication only for instance

103
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:37,580
I can a 65,000 three who wants to

104
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:41,630
consume the traffic for DBA<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero once I</font>

105
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:45,080
64 can advertise the oh I used in ipv4

106
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:47,570
address in the slide and it's the wrong

107
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,659
address that really stinks anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

108
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,240
didn't catch them all so can advertise

109
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,210
DB 80 once I 64 you set to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretend</font>

110
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:00,170
that's a v6 address with a one behind it

111
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,180
can say I am attached to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6500</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too and</font>

112
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,880
I have a connection to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so they're</font>

113
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,900
farming advertised this route with 6500

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,390
to 6500 three in the AAS path and 65,000

115
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,210
will be none the wiser so to get around

116
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:17,330
this type of attack we need some sort of

117
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,080
path validation so first thing I will do

118
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,840
is I will talk about a little bit

119
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,419
requirement I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people ask</font>

120
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,369
me about pass validation in the last six

121
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">months or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and again like I said when</font>

122
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,520
I on-boarded with LinkedIn the first

123
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,800
thing they impressed on me was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> path</font>

124
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">validation is a big deal for us and</font>

125
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,810
there are various<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

126
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,950
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into but I won't but anyway so some</font>

127
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,300
of the requirements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked to</font>

128
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,979
people about and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can agree or</font>

129
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,200
disagree and I'm happy if you disagree

130
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,000
in fact I'm really happy if you disagree

131
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,390
or disagree or agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't really care</font>

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,340
i just want your input right or wrong

133
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,590
good or bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just want your input on</font>

134
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,219
this this is what I've heard and brought

135
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:58,010
up come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Ruiz bgp because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

136
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,900
trusted and understood this does not

137
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,719
however mean

138
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,698
using the current bgp peering sessions

139
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,380
will talk about that in a second using a

140
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,270
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> address family or a new message</font>

141
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,190
right now we're looking at a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

142
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,070
family in the little<font color="#E5E5E5"> group of people we</font>

143
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,750
have gathered together but that's not a

144
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,000
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could be changed at any</font>

145
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,130
moment no reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reuse current best</font>

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,350
path for this application we want to

147
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,150
reuse existing policy mechanisms if

148
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible this is one of the beauties of</font>

149
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,770
running bgp is that you can attach

150
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,479
communities to your advertisements and

151
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,039
if you have a community that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to</font>

152
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,120
filter out you can use that same

153
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:36,090
community to filter advertisements for

154
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,590
pass validation so it's kind of cool

155
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,109
don't mess with origin authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

156
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,969
general again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to argue</font>

157
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">about origin authentication and whether</font>

158
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,560
what we have is good or bad or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

159
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,739
that's not really you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it seems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

161
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,250
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not perfect nothing is perfect</font>

162
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,289
everything is a trade-off in the world

163
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,830
of complexity and network engineering so

164
00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:02,020
it is what it is and so the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

165
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,940
would like to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is our sink</font>

166
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,349
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a scaling issue that I've</font>

167
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,479
heard a lot I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard this through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

168
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:09,039
grapevine and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and I'm not</font>

169
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:10,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure it's absolutely true but I've heard</font>

170
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,520
this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that it might be</font>

171
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,820
possible or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful to think</font>

172
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,969
about a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow whatever we do for</font>

173
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:22,570
path validation to replace our sink in

174
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,620
the long run turn my big thing is is I

175
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,430
want to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty percent of the</font>

176
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,590
problem space in the deplorable way I

177
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,000
want it to be so one thing is is that i

178
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have come to the</font>

179
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,780
conclusion after looking at this problem

180
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:39,099
for 15 years that there are no perfect

181
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,479
solutions and hints if i can solve

182
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:42,370
eighty percent of the problem in a way

183
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,270
that cost me very very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i can</font>

184
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,710
deploy it then i can find other ways to

185
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,419
solve the other twenty percent of the

186
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,388
problem and i'm perfectly happy with

187
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,280
that solution I think kada was on stage

188
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,080
last I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some ideas</font>

189
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,849
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

190
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,380
measurement I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be some</font>

191
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:00,909
ways to measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and look at</font>

192
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,070
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can catch the twenty</font>

193
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:07,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent the straight up path validation</font>

194
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:10,120
can't do so again an example I put on

195
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,289
here stateful inspection IDs payers you

196
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,009
know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are various things that I do</font>

197
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:13,719
in the networking

198
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:15,249
worldwide take pairs of solutions or

199
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:17,169
multiple solutions and try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

200
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:18,580
what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do there's a thing on here don't</font>

201
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,580
make the HD crypto I'm not convinced

202
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,498
that's correct yet persistence and face

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS I actually am not convinced</font>

204
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:29,110
that's correct either<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

205
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,759
nice thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so rethinking</font>

206
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,709
requirements one thing I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

207
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,849
sure I do is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to I want to</font>

208
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:37,119
hide things that aren't otherwise

209
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,860
available this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a big deal for a lot</font>

210
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,539
of transit providers it's not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

211
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,370
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily but it is for a lot</font>

212
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,160
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people being able to hide things that</font>

213
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,560
are otherwise not available or otherwise

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,439
that you can't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route reflector</font>

or a chart of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet connectivity</font>

216
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,920
and discover things I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

220
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,500
be able to tell my peer what my

221
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,360

222
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,690
able to tell their peers if I can do

223
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's a way to do that and now</font>

224
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,730
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a trust mechanism</font>

225
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,290
and clearly people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> play against the</font>

226
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,990
rules or play outside the rules and do

227
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,670
whatever they want to do I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to optionally attach peering types</font>

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,930
and other policy to specific

relationships this is optional<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font>

231
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,769
very insistent on this being optional at

232
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,120
this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I understand again</font>

233
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,310
that some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want you to know</font>

234
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,260
what their policies are now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll say</font>

235
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,959
later on that the more you expose your

236
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,029
policies the more secure things become

237
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:39,069
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are business relationships and</font>

238
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:42,610
you just have to be you know whatever

00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:44,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is it is now another thing that I</font>

240
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,639
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in requirements are</font>

241
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:48,010
that we have come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this little</font>

00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,050
group i'm working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with is that we want</font>

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">an overlay carrying the information has</font>

244
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,250
been very insisted upon me or very

245
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,349
impressed on me by various people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

246
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,630
do not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to touch existing ebgp peers</font>

247
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,430
so even if i'm using vgp as a transport

248
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,750
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's convenience neat and all</font>

249
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,760
your knots already know how to configure

250
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,889
it I don't want to touch my existing

251
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,689
ebgp peers by the way this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me as</font>

252
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:09,519
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay linkedin doesn't want to touch</font>

253
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,860
my existing bgp peers it's very

254
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,579
important from a scaling perspective and

255
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,170
various other reasons incremental value

256
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:19,089
or incremental deployment should add

257
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,449
value incrementally this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very big</font>

258
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:23,980
deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the concept that</font>

259
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you might</font>

260
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,339
find this slightly familiar

261
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,660
we've grown by the drawing board and we

262
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,050
thought some things about what we're

263
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:36,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing but conceptually we are working</font>

264
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:38,349
with a s level semantics I say we we

265
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,360
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very small team formed of a</font>

266
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,740
couple of different providers and a

267
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,900
couple of different vendors that we're

268
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">working with to come up with this this</font>

269
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not anything that's kind of big</font>

270
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,079
public stuff right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we're just</font>

271
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,190
batting ideas around on a little mailing

272
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,800
list to try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what we're</font>

273
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing only a is level changes should be</font>

274
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">reflected in the base advertisements</font>

275
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,760
this is a scaling issue as much as we

276
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,040
can more detail may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> included but</font>

277
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,810
doesn't have to be so conceptually you

278
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,490
build a set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> path pairs each path bear</font>

279
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,770
can contain a policy if you want to

280
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:13,810
these can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a set of paths a as</font>

281
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:15,250
filters at the AAS edge depends so one

282
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,430
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've argued about</font>

283
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:21,550
discussed is frankly I don't care what

284
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,469
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're a s all i care about</font>

285
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,510
is getting the information to decide how

286
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,520
to do about path validation the best

287
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,010
that I can and how are you use that

288
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">information is completely up to you so</font>

289
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,050
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as path filters</font>

290
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,819
or if you want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as some other</font>

291
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:39,040
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might want to do it's not</font>

292
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">really my business to delve around in</font>

293
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,750
your AAS so you do what you'd like to do

294
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:45,069
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find ways to provide</font>

295
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,830
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the information to make this</font>

296
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,330
work so for instance different

297
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:53,680
advertisements received with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the asp s</font>

298
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:56,680

299
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,469
65,000 you can look and say as a 65,000

300
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,880
for connected to 65,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 yes is there a</font>

301
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,170
policy along the path that says I

302
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,660
shouldn't be receiving this route no

303
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:08,770
that's only if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy is exposed am</font>

304
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:10,959
I connected a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 65,000 yes i have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 80%</font>

305
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:14,380
reliability<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think there abouts that</font>

306
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,439
this is a good route now<font color="#E5E5E5"> again doesn't</font>

307
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,360
solve everything but network engineering

308
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,370
is a set of trade-offs and it is what it

309
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,839
is and I'm hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can find other</font>

310
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,060
ways to solve the rest of the problems

311
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,830
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> without getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too much more</font>

312
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,829
intrusive than where we already are Oh

313
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:32,149
uh

314
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:55,620
don't touch the bed button<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah hey okay</font>

315
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:57,359
anyway so conceptually this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree</font>

316
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">taste base tag I assume you know what a</font>

317
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,850
dag is it's like an SPF or a Dykstra SPF

318
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,200
without taking anything off policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

319
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,210
hang off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the note so we have another</font>

320
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">name for this called a pass state vector</font>

321
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:11,220
you may find a research paper out there

322
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,600
on that that's very old so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

323
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,710
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend time talking about</font>

324
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,050
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you really want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

325
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this feel free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to send me an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email catch</font>

326
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,949
me afterwards I don't really care I

327
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,329
don't care about this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some stuff</font>

328
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:26,030
about packet formatting that we were

329
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,030
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about yes Randy shaking his head</font>

330
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay Randy wants me to go back I'll go</font>

331
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,580
back and I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this this is</font>

332
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,530
conceptually one way of doing this we

333
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually don't know how to do this okay</font>

334
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,329
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip this</font>

335
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:44,520
slide yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine this is</font>

336
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,850
conceptually we have been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

337
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">within our little with our little quiet</font>

338
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:54,090
little group<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about this that you</font>

339
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:55,950
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use bgp AF and you would reform at</font>

340
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,530
the AF and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a special best path</font>

341
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:01,110
because this is the easy thing to do

342
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I'll be honest you know I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

343
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">a big fan of overloading bgp with</font>

344
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,630
everything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stinking world and if</font>

345
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,950
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to overload bgp with</font>

346
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,810
everything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world i really kind of</font>

347
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:14,430
prefer to do it any new message type

348
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:19,050
rather than in<font color="#CCCCCC"> uaf but the world is what</font>

349
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:23,819
the world is and tilting at windmills is

350
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:26,339
not my favorite hobby so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

351
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:32,340
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> argue about what the formatting looks</font>

352
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:34,170
like operationally a 65,000 the way this

353
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,610
we're thinking about doing this is that

354
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,620
you could advertise three different

355
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,570
connectivity sets for instance you could

356
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,450
bound a community using communities and

357
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,920
a asset or a set of connectivity which

358
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,570
would be signed with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your private key</font>

359
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,310
which could be validated by your public

360
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,960
key and we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get too</font>

361
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,209
deep in the crypto because the crypto is

362
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,889
the crypto

363
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,258
you know we have some smarter people

364
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:56,240
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> crypto than I am in the world and</font>

365
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:57,649
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of relying on them and other</font>

366
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,319
people in the community to help us with

367
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:02,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">this but anyway community bound so again</font>

368
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:05,269
I'm thinking in terms of if I can attach

369
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:07,128
a community<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a route I can attach it</font>

370
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:09,829
to this advertisement this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

371
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:11,300
joys of using bgp is if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have the</font>

372
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:13,099
community sets<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually filter</font>

373
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,868
with the same communities on my edges

374
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,970
and where I'm filtering routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

375
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:19,550
advert actually filter connectivity as

376
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,660
well so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a general idea</font>

377
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,939
again not not not validated or<font color="#CCCCCC"> borne out</font>

378
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,829
operationally again i kin community i

379
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:30,879
can use transit communities to block

380
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,989
routes one hop away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> me if I want to</font>

381
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,110
people can do bad things with your

382
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,999
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you hand it to them I'm</font>

383
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,480
sorry I can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about that but</font>

384
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:43,759
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can do i</font>

385
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,170
can actually mark non transits and

386
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,029
appearing relationship we're talking

387
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,279
about adding bits for this that would be

388
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:51,139
encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and validated in a way that</font>

389
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,600
would allow you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> declare a customer as</font>

390
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:56,959
a customer as a valley and block the

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,869
valley routes in the network attacks

392
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,779
resolved of course of 65,000 five at

<font color="#E5E5E5">verte eyes is DB a 01 with the path of</font>

394

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually look at your graph or you can</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually look at your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want call it a</font>

397

graph but however it's actually

398
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,379
implemented in a particular instance of

399
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:17,389
this type of thing you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually look</font>

00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,670
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> growth of the pears and say you</font>

401
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:23,089
know what 65,000 one doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

402
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:25,309
connection to 65,000 five even a 65,000

403
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:27,949
five advertises a connection to 65,000

404
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:29,420
one if you know much about Dykstra and

405
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:31,878
SPF you always wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wake an</font>

406
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,189
activity check so if 65,000 one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

407
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,189
advertising a backlink back to 65,000

408
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:40,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">five and exists it isn't matter what</font>

409
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:43,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">65,000 five claims it just works that</font>

410
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,829
way in that type of a thing now if

411
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,049
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> decides to expose who is a not</font>

412
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:50,109
supposed to be a valley then you can

413
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:53,600
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark that information and block</font>

414
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,399
valley transit through of aliens for

415
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,879
instance 65,000 one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this instance</font>

416
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,919
should not be a transit path between

417
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,460
65,000 to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty five thousand five</font>

418
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:05,160
so

419
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:09,270
you can actually mark that and make that

420
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,850
not happen so thoughts on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution I</font>

421
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,490

00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:21,439
reasonably worded government mandate now

423
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:23,790
I said reasonably worded so it's

424
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,110
reasonably rewarded<font color="#CCCCCC"> in government in the</font>

425

426
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:30,209
oxymoron to some people but that is what

427
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,650
it is I think it would protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent or more of what needs to</font>

433
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,130
attacks necessarily it's all kind of

434
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,320
dependent on what you do with your

435
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,330
certificates but that would actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

436
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,120
can protect your private information in

a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to all right path</font>

438
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,169
forward we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small group working on</font>

00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,720
this we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are slowly but surely increasing</font>

440
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,280
the group we need some community support

441
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,110
to think about this a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

442
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,510
more thinkers thinking about this we've

443
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,090
not taken to this this to the ITF yet we

444
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,710
are trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get actually to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

445
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,860
where we have implementations before we

446
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:16,020
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the ITF just to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic</font>

447
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:19,439
about things if a mandates forthcoming

448
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,910
the goal is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font>

449
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a solution on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the table if</font>

450
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:25,920
something happens if somebody says this

451
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,179
must take place and I understand because

452
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,550
I've talked to a lot of my friends in

453
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider community that you know</font>

454
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of people want to do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

455
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things there a lot simpler for</font>

456
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:39,090
instance well let's let every large

457
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,149
every tier one set up their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRR and</font>

458
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,860
will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the problem that way</font>

459
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I live on the edge and I'm not</font>

460
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,939
really happy with that solution for

461
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,560
various reasons and I don't think tier 1

462
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,270
and tier 2 should actually be happy with

463
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that solution either some people are</font>

464
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,020
saying let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to the IRS there's</font>

465
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,310
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of studies on the IRS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

466
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,080
think they're probably reasonably

467
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,000
correct in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases from what I've</font>

468
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,310
heard Randy shaking his head notice one

469
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,040
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get called on that one but</font>

470
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:07,919
nonetheless I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

471
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,300
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IR system is that it's easy</font>

472
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,800
enough to convince<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to put</font>

473
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">information in and it's hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

474
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">people to take the stuff out</font>

475
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,259
it's invalid so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

476
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's a little more dynamic</font>

477
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:23,419
and works as the topology goes and can

478
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:26,059
be automated and dev opt really like

479
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:29,570
that I use that term I'll say it three

480
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:33,350
times DevOps DevOps their bombs all

481
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:35,480
right anyway can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> coded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and dev</font>

482
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">upped and I think we need a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

483
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,620
stuff going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to make this better sir</font>

484
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,240
questions and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you my</font>

matured over the years I'm really

cheering you should be aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:34,428
internet draft for it and there's

504
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:37,720
implementations and testing the one

505
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:43,220
fundamental thing that bothers me about

506
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:49,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter AS map being the essential</font>

507
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:54,950
semantics is that a yes enter a routing

508
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:57,200
is prefix specific not a as specific if

509
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:01,190
I understand that sure and but but

510
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:05,659
otherwise keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> man okay good</font>

511
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:11,720
thanks now Sandy's gonna beat me up I'm

512
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:14,509
not um I think you'd win the fight I did

513
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,610
you go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know it was the</font>

about validation works in new owners

don't tell me about organ validation

517

does

00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:34,939
wait way back way way back which one do

523
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,840
on your subsequent discussion no but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

524
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,149
did want you to understand if linkedin

is looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it is most</font>

emphatically not the a s that signs the

done asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> precision in two slides</font>

534
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:25,129
do all you know say 2001 creates a row

535
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:28,610
assigns a private key yeah just too well

536
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:31,789
in the IRR world for most things in the

537
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,830

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rrd p we kind of call it the Delta</font>

track yesterday had a talk by someone

550
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:16,279
who did some measurements of the valley

free gal<font color="#CCCCCC"> rexford model and the AAS paths</font>

552
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:24,320
that are exist in sixty-five percent

553
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:27,529
match that model but that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> 35%</font>

554
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,678
don't match that model so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

555
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:33,529
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to keep that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in mind and</font>

556
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,270
there is work in the grow working group

557
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:40,040
to add

00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:43,700
a bit to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp updates to say kind of</font>

559
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,639
weather adds up or down sort of so you

560
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:50,180
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about that and the BGP sec</font>

561
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,040
protocol could then be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect</font>

562
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,520
those bits and you'd end up with a

563
00:23:52,040 --> 00:24:00,139
cryptographically assured discussion of

564
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,639
what the policy was on a link right so

565
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,560
yeah so I intentionally did not mention

566
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,450
bgp set because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i didn't want to come</font>

567
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,149
here and like beat up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on anything i was</font>

568
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:10,640
my intent was just well you've got an

569
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,410
in-band mechanism using cryptography so

570
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,560
that's another in band mechanism that

571
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:21,200
you guys good to exactly so yeah okay

572
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks Annie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh it's fine oh</font>

573
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:30,020
there's dog now I'm gonna get beat up

574
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:32,960
again I never go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm from what I</font>

575
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,060
could see what you're proposing or at

576
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,750
least outlining bears some resemblance

577
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:41,720
to s 0 would be GP which had full specs

578
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:44,210
that we could read can can you

579
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,770
characterize like where your thoughts

580
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:51,500
differ from the previous sov GP yeah so

581
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,300
in many places first of all we have

582
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,890
abandoned origin authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

583
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,409
pass validation we've separated those

584
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,300
two entirely and second of all I think

585
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a completely different group</font>

586
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,680
working on this is much more realistic

587
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,690
about what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with in BGP itself</font>

588
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,630
and how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage things in BGP itself</font>

589
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,580
and I think the third thing is is you

590
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,220
know we're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid dabbling</font>

591
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,750
inside the a s we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't we just</font>

592
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,640
want to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide people with the</font>

593
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,040
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> information to build it on tools</font>

594
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,140
and do what they want to do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

595
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,909
think there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of differences in</font>

596
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:27,560
those areas it's much more and beyond

597
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,800
all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I actually have two</font>

598
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:33,770
implementations perhaps on the verge of

599
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,280
being committed so a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

600
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:40,340
about that many of your slides said you

601
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,530
had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of how to ah yes it's just</font>

602
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">yet so these are kind of non non d well</font>

603
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,859
there's ago this is

604
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:47,418
experimental right this is kind of will

605
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:49,458
this actually work can we do what we

606
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:51,559
want to do and I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lay down</font>

607
00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:54,709
packet formats right now because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

608
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,809
actually I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of it is is that</font>

609
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:58,459
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get implementations under our</font>

610
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:00,019
belt to understand if the packet formats

611
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:04,579
anybody is thinking about will actually

612
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:06,489
work so that that's a crucial key little

613
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:13,178
more experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what we're doing</font>

614
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:13,179
yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> rasulullah go for deutsche telekom</font>

615
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:23,239
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I am I would be interested to</font>

616
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:26,569
have a clear description of what

617
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:29,839
information model you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use you</font>

618
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:32,809
are coming in and in the presentation in

619
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:35,779
particular saying well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our sink is a</font>

620
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:38,479
bed transport which well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok other people</font>

621
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:41,179
are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and then well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok bgp is a</font>

622
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:44,679
nice transport and then you come up with

623
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:48,049
stuff that is to a large degree

624
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:52,009
structure following the chosen transport

625
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:55,639
and that's kind of that's kind of not

626
00:26:52,009 --> 00:27:00,589
really the way i would like to look at

627
00:26:55,639 --> 00:27:04,599
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok expressing policy in in a more</font>

628
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:09,769
abstract way the next thing is all ok

629
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:14,359
for getting things actually secured

630
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:17,089
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we want to and which quite</font>

631
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:22,208
certainly what part we would be part of

632
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:22,208
a mandate if the mandate is reasonable

633
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:31,099
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok kind of a I'm not I'm not</font>

634
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:33,649
hearing I'm not hearing the security

635
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:39,369
design which should take care of making

636
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:43,998
sure that actually authoritative data is

637
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:46,309
put into the system and it stay the

638
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:50,329
integrity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that data and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the oft</font>

639
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:53,749
entity of a data is secured and trusting

640
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:57,799
that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok after we are force some</font>

641
00:27:53,749 --> 00:28:01,789
some fuzzy data model into an<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist</font>

642
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:03,860
transport to fix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on does not</font>

643
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:07,489
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very promising and</font>

644
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:09,529
reasonable approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so first of all</font>

645
00:28:07,489 --> 00:28:11,450
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data model contact me off after</font>

646
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:12,860
or you know email me or something

647
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,049
because we can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

648
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,580
not here in the slides there is thinking

649
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:19,820
around it but it is not anything

650
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:24,289
definite as far as making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

651
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:28,700
data is correct so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell you that</font>

652
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:32,629
we are on shall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say very touchy ground</font>

653
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:35,029
with this part of the problem because i

654
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:39,949
have talked to certain providers who

655
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:43,730
have said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not want any outside body</font>

656
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:45,109
playing in my in my space and telling

657
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,210
and trying to authenticate who<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

658
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:49,129
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or not on the other hand</font>

659
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,600
from a security perspective it's very

660
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:54,469
important to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

661
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:57,259
information is correct so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

662
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,609
fine line here someplace and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

663
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:01,429
point we're going to have to figure out

664
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:03,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make this work in a way either</font>

665
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:05,059
it's going to have to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

666
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:06,229
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this anyway or we're going to</font>

667
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:09,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to come down to the point where we</font>

668
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,669
say and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to</font>

669
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:12,559
make all of this work together and I

670
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:14,960
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer that question so</font>

671
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,809
that's why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in the slides well I</font>

672
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,289
think there cannot be a question about

673
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:24,649
that integrity and authenticity of the

674
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:29,119
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is exchanged into domain has</font>

675
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:31,549
to be secured right agree I do not see

676
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:34,189
any concern that actually would say well

677
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:36,529
okay we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bypass vet yeah okay</font>

678
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,460
well we can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that after i have</font>

679
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:43,280
people who have told me otherwise

680
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,340
anything else great thanks

681
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,340
you
