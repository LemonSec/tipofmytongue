1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:14,799
oh good green button hi I'm Carl back up

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,900
here again network<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineer over at nine</font>

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,150
you know us<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS people arenít</font>

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,640
measurement performance stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,110
enough about that so one of things

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,210
wanted I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be kind of</font>

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,009
interesting since we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS we do</font>

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,450
measurements feel or do any cast

9
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:31,390
measurements we should take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know any cats obviously the</font>

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,090
ideas you got nodes every word you're

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,160
seeing a whole bunch around the world

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,660
and they're supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be only really</font>

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,150
close to everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a whole idea</font>

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,980
of doing them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> well there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing of how are they connected you know</font>

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,410
you just by transiting all the sites so

18
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,030
appearing involved or are they basically

19
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,519
just dropped in the oh I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spees where it</font>

20
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,050
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be obviously a mix the Rob so I</font>

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,430
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of you know take a</font>

22
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,320
look some of that stuff do some

23
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,390
measurements so we kind of generally

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,160
accept that knowing any cast is good in

25
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,620
a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lotta ASI must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be really good</font>

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,940
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem what's more is better you</font>

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,450
know appearing is always considered to

28
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,710
be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know so kind of</font>

29
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,149
questions I was asking was like you know

30
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,210
do more nodes make their connectivity

31
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:18,369
and you know basically is peering garden

32
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:19,839
just having transit by itself so

33
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,729
basically all I'm measuring here is

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,249
network latency I'm not doing a Jeff

35
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,009
Houston thing it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically trace</font>

36
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:28,899
routes how long is it take to get there

37
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,850
I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a so I thought hey root</font>

38
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:33,009
servers that works you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them</font>

39
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,169
have only a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few some have a lot that</font>

40
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:39,310
works now<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elsa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I need somebody has</font>

41
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:41,859
only transit so disclaimer did not use

42
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,679
dines on the dns service instead of our

43
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:46,839
competitors and pick something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that</font>

44
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:51,310
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't peering you know for</font>

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,189
contrast there's a lightning talk anyway

46
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,889
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I chart here basically the idea is</font>

47
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:58,630
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see a lot of green here so</font>

48
00:01:56,889 --> 00:02:00,699
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a DA route there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

49
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,839
about five nodes so we kind of expect

50
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,939
that we're not necessarily going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">that much green there's gonna be a bunch</font>

52
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:07,508
of places<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's you know it's just</font>

53
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:08,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">further away that kind of makes sense</font>

54
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,759
because you know if you only got five

55
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows it's kind of hard to cover the</font>

56
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:17,540
world so what about the you know a root

57
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:21,290
server has you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few more</font>

58
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,230
so take for example the<font color="#CCCCCC"> F root node you</font>

59
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,209
know somewhere around 60 nodes and well

60
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,340
it looks a little bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm</font>

61
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,950
still kind of seeing a you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> cell</font>

62
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,439
fair amount of yellow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> red here so</font>

63
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,060
obviously its seal 60 nose isn't quite

64
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,909
it seems enough to sort of cover

65
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,180
everything well you know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

66
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:47,689
something I was like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even more</font>

67
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:50,450
nodes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> tick figured you know let's</font>

68
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:51,680
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the l root note about 150</font>

69
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,108
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those that should be plenty right i</font>

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,930
mean with 150 really have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you</font>

71
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:57,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">know pretty much everybody covered and</font>

72
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,780
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we've got really interesting</font>

73
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,238
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you want to take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

74
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">at denver denver has a el brute node</font>

75
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,680
which you know may or may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> up but</font>

76
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:08,510
let's assume the top meaning if it's not

77
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,480
I mean San Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> and LA aren't</font>

78
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,129
really that far away but Denver is

79
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,988
actually really crappy why is Denver

80
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:16,388
crappy what's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crappy because</font>

81
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going all the way over to England</font>

82
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:21,079
so it's completely avoiding everything

83
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:22,839
in the US and there's other there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

84
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,340
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of looked at in this</font>

85
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,930
Japan really likes to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to either</font>

86
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:32,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sydney Australia or to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> washington DC i</font>

87
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,669
want i should say is each of these dots

88
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,440
represents a measurement point so it's

89
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:38,900
basically going and taking a look and

90
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,849
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how far is it from each</font>

91
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,680
of these points to a very albert<font color="#CCCCCC"> node</font>

92
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:46,399
and draws the appropriate color for that

93
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,190
dot in<font color="#CCCCCC"> kangra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well how's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this possible</font>

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,510
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I threw a little visual because it's</font>

95
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,549
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to put the text output of</font>

96
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,959
a tray throat and again we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

97
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,329
see the whole you know Denver running

98
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,069
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ocean like so you've got</font>

99
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:00,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">other stuff so any interesting things</font>

100
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,819
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got here is that when you connect</font>

101
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,488
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> various networks those networks may</font>

102
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:07,668
decide to carry you quite a long ways

103
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,409
because well it's peering that of course

104
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to carry a class appearing and</font>

105
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,220
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> creator cost my own network</font>

106
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,870
instead of just dropping it off to

107
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,440
transit you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not geographically</font>

108
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,579
closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's economically closer so it's</font>

109
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,370
kind of the interesting things here is

110
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,650
that even with 150 nodes you may or may

111
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,700
not get great performance so I kind of

112
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">look it isn't kind of go like peering</font>

113
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,800
man so I thought well

114
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,500
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at something that</font>

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't involve peering so take a look</font>

116
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,270
at this one this<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP xin zhang cast dns</font>

117
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,520
service it's not us it's one of our

118
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,560
competitors they've got with 20 notes

119
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,750
and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not doing too bad</font>

120
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,120
for 20 notes there's actually a whole

121
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,340
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of green and you know it's actually</font>

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really that bad so it's kind of you</font>

123
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,020
know Oh clear the answer is you know

124
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,540
just use transit you know but of course

125
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,070
transit costs money and so on but

126
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,810
someone interesting that having a lot of

127
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,640
nodes and having a lot of peering

128
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,480
doesn't necessarily equal having a

129
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,320
better experience for and customers I

130
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,150
thought you know I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should kind of</font>

131
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,300
contrast it with something else so I

132
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,010
mean who else by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google and of course</font>

133
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,440
you know Google uses a combination of

134
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,789
peering in transit and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

135
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,990
seem to be doing a really good job of it

136
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,570
so they're clearly doing a lot of

137
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:25,130
traffic engineering on this to manage

138
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:28,340
things as an aside we had went some of

139
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,140
our services we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were dropping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in remote</font>

140
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,580
nodes and we had you know some

141
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,469
interesting things about half the world

142
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,710
aside that Toronto Canada was really the

143
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,140
best place to go singapore<font color="#E5E5E5"> Donna don't</font>

144
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">go locally let's go back to Toronto a</font>

145
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,510
lot of that was because of one of our

146
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,850
money nice piece we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were and decided</font>

147
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,380
that appearing with certain global ISPs

148
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,030
is a good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and of course a</font>

149
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">globalized peas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll just like to carry</font>

150
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,200
across their backbone regardless of

151
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,320
halfway around the world or halfway

152
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,900
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the city so in this particular</font>

153
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,370
case it's you know kind of shows you

154
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,969
know hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a necessary nuttin so it'd</font>

155
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:07,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so again what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is you</font>

156
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,540
know taking from this and yes this is a

157
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,119
lightning talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing this in like</font>

158
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,830
five minutes this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not in depth deep</font>

159
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,460
analysis so yes you can poke lots of

160
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:18,020
holes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so but what I'm seeing</font>

161
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,260
here is I just having a lot of nodes

162
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,669
isn't necessarily better you know as we

163
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of saw with the elder if it wasn't</font>

164
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,120
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary that much better than</font>

165
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,789
some of the other ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> that had a lot</font>

166
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">less nodes you know appearing man can be</font>

167
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,390
kind of okay sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works out</font>

168
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,740
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> well but basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we also</font>

169
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,289
discovered you have to do a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

170
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,640
traffic engineering whack-a-mole I want

171
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use those examples unfortunately all</font>

172
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,599
clean them up so

173
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,520
the unlocker sock which is you know good

174
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">for us and then makes a bad presentation</font>

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,020
then you know parent can also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

176
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,489
good you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to kind of put the</font>

177
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,680
time and effort into kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plain</font>

178
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,700
playing the whack-a-mole game and going

179
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">through and you don't keep measuring</font>

180
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,570
kind of scene where traffic is and

181
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:00,140
figure out the right communities and so

182
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:02,810
on you know it's a very much a mileage

183
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,450
may vary this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind</font>

184
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,710
of what sort of thrown together

185
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,570
certainly something that we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> do lay</font>

186
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,469
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer talk on if there would be</font>

187
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:23,659
any interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the community on this</font>

188
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:29,750
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have thank you one question</font>

189
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:31,970
Oh does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it work okay good mr. Kohana</font>

190
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,320
context have actually used any results

191
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:38,900
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> dinosaur network I we have done this</font>

192
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,340
I didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to display our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our own</font>

193
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,750
partially because some of these probes

194
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,979
are collocated with their own servers

195
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,680
and it's kind of pointless to sort of

196
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,919
show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really half a millisecond</font>

197
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,440
across a a router that's why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> use one</font>

198
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our competitors which was also a</font>

199
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,650
transit only right and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may</font>

200
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,930
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a longer talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> partly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

201
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:07,700
longer talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be useful okay thank</font>

202
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:10,760
you Randy bush okay um there were two

203
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:13,219
reasons for massive anycast one was a

204
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,620
better customer experience but possibly

205
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important one was resilience to</font>

206
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:23,660
attack and when we see the 38 mess et

207
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:27,500
cetera I really think you should

208
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,650
consider not putting node so near the

209
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">next tranche of nodes not near your</font>

210
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:37,459
customers and eyeballs but near the

211
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:44,169
sources of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks to soak them up</font>

212
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:44,169
where they start good fight

213
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:54,690
thank you very much next up we have a

214
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Daniel o asking the question where are</font>

215
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the inning casters it's kind of see a</font>

216
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:04,469
theme emerging here hi everyone on the

217
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,569
last area being study any<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast and we've</font>

218
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,360
done a study about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anika a year i'm</font>

219
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,370
presenting you where r 10 casters and i

220
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,680
am a PhD student from telecom<font color="#CCCCCC"> poly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tech</font>

221
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,590
and this is a work that they have done

222
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,630
with my supervisor de<font color="#E5E5E5"> rossi and also the</font>

223
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people as the an agility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job done</font>

224
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:25,439
ouch so first of all today<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will</font>

225
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,780
introduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> you our technique that we use</font>

226
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,060
for Reggie locate the anycast<font color="#CCCCCC"> distances</font>

227
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,910
and the second point it will be our

228
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,430
results of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our ipv4 any consensus it and</font>

229
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,939
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some screenshots our demo</font>

230
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:42,030
software that online and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Luca news and</font>

231
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,520
finally our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ongoing work on application</font>

232
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,819
of this work to a bgp eject detection

233
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:52,470
that for a moment for the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

234
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:55,350
window a katana from Qaeda so before

235
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting my PhD I was looking some nano</font>

236
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:02,400
video there was a presentation who are

237
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,340
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> N casters and actually so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after some</font>

238
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,410
years finally we came up with where they

239
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,290
are and these our diamond it's available

240
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:15,180
online and to also all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results you</font>

241
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:16,800
can browse there so when I started the

242
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,910
was checking online as like which

243
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,130
services could locate any cost and there

244
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,250
were some commercial database and

245
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:28,710
dessert the answer we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting some</font>

246
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">poor on Suarez like United States other</font>

247
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're getting really precise information</font>

248
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,610
is like lat even lunch dude but where we

249
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:39,060
try to jerk it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the map this was the</font>

250
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:42,420
results after we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some</font>

251
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,339
distributes measurement platform but the

252
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,439
result was always the same we're getting

253
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:51,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">always one answer not the least of</font>

254
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:54,160
location so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what we need is</font>

255
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,628
just a few latency measurement

256
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,868
over this one we want justice ployed

257
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:05,300
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> latin some Latins some speed of</font>

258
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:06,860
light violation and so some measurement

259
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,258
platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> it somebody's really miss you</font>

260
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:14,089
and platinum can do this so how does it

261
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:16,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">work we use different platforms as like</font>

262
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:19,040
ripe Atlas<font color="#E5E5E5"> planeta but we can use also</font>

263
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:21,889
other we leverage some Latin z

264
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,679
measurement we convert this latency in a

265
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:28,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">radius of the disk and we try to detect</font>

266
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,749
some speed of light violation the next

267
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,329
step is try to enumerate the maximum

268
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:34,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of circle that you don't</font>

269
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:36,799
intersect each other that is an np-hard

270
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,369
problem but there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> greedy algorithm</font>

271
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,860
works quite well that word of this phase

272
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:45,949
is a set of circle that don't intersect

273
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,660
each other and inside each disk we try

274
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:51,439
to do locate where is the anycast

275
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:53,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">distance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally we found that the</font>

276
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:56,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">most populated city is the best choice</font>

277
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,749
what we do after is to shrink the radius

278
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:01,879
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latins measurement around the</font>

279
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:04,369
city that we picked a we treat the

280
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:07,639
process so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are able to increase the</font>

281
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:10,910
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any consistency found so</font>

282
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,730
basically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an example we just it</font>

283
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:16,399
was one target we just leverages from

284
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,970
several vantage points our measurement

285
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,399
and what what you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that just</font>

286
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,959
the ten percent of disc at the raddest

287
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,429
that was a smaller than thousand

288
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:31,489
kilometers so the performance of the

289
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:33,949
software quite good as like we are able

290
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to enumerate allocate over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 75</font>

295
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,419
are quite fast in few milliseconds we

00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:53,209
can give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer next step was</font>

297
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:55,759
the census we had really to do a lot of

00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:59,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">work to rendering the everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> letting</font>

299
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:02,779
work so we were starting from 10,000

300
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:06,040
live targets for one target for each /

301
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:11,709
24 and we were probing them from hundred

302
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:14,790
vantage points using ICMP packets what

303
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:18,008
we were doing was probing them with

304
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:21,040
thousand packets per second view and we

305
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:24,399
try to slow down<font color="#E5E5E5"> our tool just because</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we try to decrease</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of packet</font>

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,019
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete one census in a few</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">milliseconds that first census it means</font>

312
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,980
one week so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything at</font>

313
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,990
then we came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

three hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I thought would finally</font>

316
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:55,060
we have thousand anycast subnet prefix

who are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep here is the list what</font>

318
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:02,649
we found was till one and some ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> P</font>

popular web content and we can also

321
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:11,110
although tcp ports we were finding that

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:13,660
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> serving some different services</font>

00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:01,000
maybe while we receive this message

00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:04,180
could be too<font color="#CCCCCC"> late on the other side we</font>

our software and our results of the

census that were quite lightweight

346
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:19,910
everything is open source is on the

347
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,950
website you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can plug your</font>

348
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,890
measurement or you can use directly ripe

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,390
Atlas and all the results of the census

350
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,660
there is also a web interface that you

351
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,189
can just insert an IP before<font color="#E5E5E5"> or just the</font>

352
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:47,390
name and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can check if it's any cuts</font>

353
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:50,300
or not and that's all for today next up

354
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,830
we have Jeff<font color="#E5E5E5"> Osborne from ISC talking</font>

355
00:15:50,300 --> 00:16:02,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the route soak up more</font>

356
00:15:51,830 --> 00:16:04,040
badness I've got three<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes into</font>

357
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,970
lunch somebody time me let's see if I

358
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,680
can do this this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going to be</font>

359
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,960
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is generally a lightning talk</font>

360
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,270
I don't have slides I have a few minutes

361
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,010
of something I wanted to ask about and I

362
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,069
didn't pay Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bush a penny and he</font>

363
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,140
totally set me up we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to expand</font>

364
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> F route in ways that it gets out</font>

365
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:27,110
there and sucks up more of the badness

366
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:29,540
so I'm Jeff<font color="#CCCCCC"> Osborne I'm the president of</font>

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">IFC we're known for developing bind and</font>

a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 s up you already saw the F route as</font>

372
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,820
deployed there are 58 servers around the

373
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,069
world now and we've wondered why it

374
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,660
wouldn't make more sense given changes

375
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,670
in technology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how cheap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's</font>

376
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting to go with hundreds or possibly</font>

377
00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:00,560
in the low thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are a total</font>

378
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:03,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of about less than 600 root servers in</font>

380
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,060
to them are something worth looking at

381
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,910
but Randy brings up the much more

382
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,339
interesting point this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> anycast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

383
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,590
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop a lot of bad attacks out</font>

384
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:19,730
where they are if we push the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers</font>

385
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:22,760
out to the edges to get all Sesame

386
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,530
Street on you let me do a little 62nd

387
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,790
bit all internet traffic is routed to

388
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,360
its destination by the routing

389
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,950
infrastructure anycast routing let's

390
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,360
there be more than one destination for

391
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,350
this to the attached the attack

392
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">traffic's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

393
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,539

394
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,909
topologically closer node and then

395
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,890
that's basically absorbing the attack

396
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,669
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minute thing I'm trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

397
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,980
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in three minutes because</font>

398
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:48,799
somebody's generally timing me anyway

399
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,049
the short answer is we're really looking

400
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,309
to get tremendously more nodes out there

401
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:55,250
and it takes a little bit of routing

402
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:59,090
magic you can't just drop a<font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font>

403
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,770
instance in your house without some

404
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,270
magic going on we're looking for

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">partners who are interested who are</font>

406
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:08,330
deployed internationally we think it's a

407
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:10,370
value for most isp's ccTLD is to have a

408
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">root instance to sort of keep the</font>

415
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,130
thought about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like using a</font>

416
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,799
thousand minnow boards we've thought

417
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,659
about using containers there are

418

<font color="#E5E5E5">different ways to do this we're still in</font>

419

the wouldn't it be better to do a lot

420

more phase but this spring we're trying
