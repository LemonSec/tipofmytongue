10
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,530
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get us interactive as the</font>

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,210
discussion as we can on have these

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,160
people in part all their wisdom and new

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,950
experiences to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of you who</font>

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,169
haven't embarked on this journey yet and

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,570
so on to that end what I did was I made

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,370
some questions and what I wanted to do

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,370
and I by the way I don't know if this

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,449
will work at all I'm just winging it so

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,788
what I'm going to do is ask these guys

20
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,408
to answer these questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then i'm</font>

21
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,330
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what will work better whether</font>

22
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,950
or not we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's questions if we</font>

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,450
can entertain those immediately after

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,909
each of these questions or save them for

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,409
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm thinking that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a better to</font>

26
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,939
try to entertain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

27
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,909
immediately so people can remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

28
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,798
it was we were talking about so we have

29
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,799
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions and then dave taylor is</font>

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked for a few minutes on mask be GMP</font>

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,119
if anybody knows what that is they'll be

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,500
an arson to know too and then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get some a little bit of discussion</font>

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,689
on that maybe some talk about futures

35
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,880
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to say i think a</font>

36
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,139
word with you about clock management if

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,390
we're going to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these people</font>

38
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">a few minutes to speak on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling</font>

39
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,950
leave a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes for each of them we</font>

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,640
still have to kind of move along so I

41
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:52,049
i'll have to look at Mike yeah it's off

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,870

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,700
have your name so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe as the</font>

50
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,900
first time you go through an answer one

51
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these questions may be introduced</font>

52
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,370
through you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best way</font>

53
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,989
to handle this so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just let me</font>

54
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,610
just show you what I'm hoping is<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

55
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what I thought would be</font>

56
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,150
interesting is for people to hear what

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,489
these folks are deploying in their

58
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,610
backbones right now and how they're

59
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:45,060
doing it on spar stamps and bgp msdp

60
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,230
those sort of things to DB MRP another

61
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,980
thing that comes up a lot is how do I

62
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,380
handle customer sites on and there's

63
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,149
kind of two cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that tail tail</font>

64
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,319
sites notes you want to provide transit

65
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,209
and then there's this other whole issue

66
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,140
of dial-up which seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a great</font>

67
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest to everyone and it will also be</font>

68
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,108
interesting to know what's driving the

69
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,880
demand for these people because a lot of

70
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:08,970
times multicast is a service that on

71
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,519
everybody wants that nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows why so</font>

72
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,950
it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what else do I</font>

73
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,870
have oh yeah it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting to know</font>

74
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">where on each of these folks is</font>

75
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,470
multicast appearing and what their

76
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,700
policy is or how you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

77
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,540
might be able to appear with them if you

78
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,709
want and then have dave talked about on

79
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,600
matthew j MP and then if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

80
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,359
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> time left we'll try to look at this</font>

81
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,910
other stuff so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> being said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

82
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:35,700
what the way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is or the way i'd</font>

83
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:40,920
like to try it is just go left to right

84
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,390
and um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay according to though do I</font>

85
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:48,679
have this computed you have about five

86
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:48,679
minutes at most okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay each</font>

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,260
yeah well then okay well let's see I

88
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,179
guess you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the things that</font>

89
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">we should talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about one of the things I</font>

90
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted after switching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and really my</font>

91
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:07,929
color you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a photographer okay</font>

92
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,309
simply deployment status I'll say my

93
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,560
name is Joey and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kim and I'm with very</font>

94
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,439
oh and for the deployment status of

95
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,810
multicast inside vario in the bathroom

96
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,870

100
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been working very hard to resolve</font>

101
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,410
some implementation and tactical issues

102
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,570
with our corporate cooperation of the

103
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">vendors in our case we have a</font>

104
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,440
multi-vendor background in terms of the

105
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,460
routers and so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some more</font>

106
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,260
coordination in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Parkdale and it's been</font>

107
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,508
an interesting experience in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-touch machinery the</font>

using pins boss mode actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> response</font>

reduce configuration at the edges

of have bought performance by space and

117
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,760
of them we have bunch of legacy embo<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

infrastructure that we have to support

<font color="#E5E5E5">and such and so we're basically giving</font>

along somewhat slowly and right now with

138
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:11,189
more production and such more structure

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,129
will be imposed on that but at this

140
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:15,659
point that's still very much of a let's

141
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:18,539
try to play with this to make this work

142

<font color="#E5E5E5">and try to get as much operation</font>

143
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,539
experience as possible type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

144
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:29,639
what else what's driving the demands

145
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:30,990
don't answer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other question</font>

146
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,229
how many people here have ever heard of

147
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,639
mptp so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just be cheap you that</font>

148
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:40,219
carries prefixes that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

149
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:42,990
used for multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ms.vp</font>

150
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:47,909
not much do we need like five seconds on

151
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:52,379
msdp to want that yeah okay let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

152
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:53,879
a diversion here for a second obvious

153
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,729
figure out how to work out power point

154
00:06:53,879 --> 00:07:02,699
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have a page or whatever this</font>

155
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:05,128
thing is i think i've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

156
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:09,449
once before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bunch of slides on it we</font>

157
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:12,360
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do them all do a few okay</font>

158
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,539
so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem i'll see ya not</font>

159
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,539
right

160
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:28,490
okay hang on this should just take a

161
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:29,919
minute if we're lucky so msdp is sort of

162
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,650
a simple-minded protocol that was

163
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed by all the usual suspects on</font>

164
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,099
pretty quickly and implemented pretty

165
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:41,689
quickly by cisco announced out there in

166
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:43,308
many places on basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason was</font>

167
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:45,199
designed was because providers want to

168
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:48,559
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run slower back ones for obvious</font>

169
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,389
reasons but the problem well the problem

170
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,979
with this is that spice<font color="#CCCCCC"> mom is designed</font>

171
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:53,689
in sort of a flat way so they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font>

172
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:56,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">space that's associated with that is</font>

173
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:58,849
flat and that leads to problems like a

174
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,349
required sharing of our piece and so

175
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:04,930
forth across administrative boundaries

176
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:07,878
that was really not<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a good idea so</font>

177
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,550
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we were looking for was a</font>

178
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:13,909
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put your own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> administrative</font>

179
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">league controlled core RP wherever you</font>

180
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:17,808
wanted to and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all reduced to this</font>

181
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,430
last problem here which was how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

182
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:22,039
connect multiple shared trees that were

183
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,509
under different administrative control

184
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:28,248
without having any third party

185
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:31,899
dependencies right so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I</font>

186
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:31,899
think up some pictures on how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

187
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:38,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the long story short is if</font>

188
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:40,130
you're running msdp and opt-in sparse

189
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:41,360
mode basically the RP knows where all

190
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,610
the sources are because they have to

191
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,319
register to it right that's how that's

192
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,029
House sources become known to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the RP and</font>

193
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">our p knows that there's receivers</font>

194
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:52,130
inside the domain because it's received

195
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,810
joints so if an archaean one domain

196
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,910
could tell where the active sources were

197
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,050
in another domain then all that other RP

198
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,939
would have to do is join towards those

199
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,469
sources and and voila<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd be all</font>

200
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,649
connected but there'd be no sharing

201
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:08,060
there'd be no<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain shared trees</font>

202
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:11,990
so here's here's what it looks like so

203
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,529
if there's a source in a s1 oops that

204
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:17,600
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite work I don't know what</font>

205
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,610
videos coming off center niggas if

206
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,459
there's a source over in a s1 there what

207
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,829
it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is send a register to the RT one</font>

208
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:26,989
and that's just normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kim sparse mode</font>

209
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:29,870
operation and there's a receiver like on

210
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:34,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left it sends joins towards the RP</font>

211
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,589
or what msdp does is um works like this

212
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,170
you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pairing up looks like a bgp</font>

213
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,089
peering it's got a tcp connection and

214
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:45,349
all of that stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

215
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:46,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">RPS usually and over tcp as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said and</font>

216
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be multi hot and there's no such</font>

217
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,940
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as like internal msdp it just did</font>

218
00:09:50,120 --> 00:10:00,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the same okay so how this works is</font>

219
00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:00,820
on yeah well it's yeah but it's not

220
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:08,600
aside so what happens ok so the source

221
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,939
ends well actually it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last hop</font>

222
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:16,510
router on the path to the source<font color="#CCCCCC"> tend to</font>

223
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:19,580
register<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the RP one and RP one if if</font>

224
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,140
everyone will send on were called source

225
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,700
active messages that just described

226
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,930
where the source is back in this domain

227
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,760
to RP to and when um when our<font color="#E5E5E5"> key to see</font>

228
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,620
is that it has a member it can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> join</font>

229
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,240
directly on the shortest path tree back

230
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,779
to that source so there's no

231
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-domain trees there so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

232
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:38,240
picture of that I'm sorry to cut off on

233
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,400
in their society I don't know enough

234
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,800
about this to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it go the other way</font>

235
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,170
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what happens is RP to will</font>

236
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,000
just become a G<font color="#E5E5E5"> join back to that back</font>

237
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,469
to the source and then they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and</font>

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,890
then packets will flow in that direction

239
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,640
like this so it's very simple that way

240
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,080
and what we wind up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with is the</font>

241
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,760
interdomain source tree not an inter

242
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,170
domain surgery and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of the</font>

243
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:06,830
important concept here<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok that's all i</font>

244
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:08,449
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say about that and if</font>

245
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:13,220
anybody has questions about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

246
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:16,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">now huh if anybody has questions about</font>

247
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we came in a talk about it after or</font>

248
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,990
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have time left</font>

249
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:24,830
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have to do is figure out how to</font>

250
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,830
get my<font color="#E5E5E5"> nose back</font>

251
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:49,430
okay what go ahead ideally I work for

252
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,350
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> four spreads and we also are like</font>

253
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:55,099
thing with Dorian was talking about are

254
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:58,100
we going<font color="#CCCCCC"> with MBG p pim and in the near</font>

255
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:03,380
future<font color="#CCCCCC"> msdp we right now we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

256
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,940
backbone where we have a bgp mesh and we

257
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">running pim sports mode it's actually a</font>

258
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,640
sparse dance<font color="#E5E5E5"> over da da repeat the same</font>

259
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,410
exact thing during a set and<font color="#CCCCCC"> appearing</font>

260
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,120
we're appearing at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> soccer nap spend</font>

261
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,980
nap and also appearing a six<font color="#CCCCCC"> west or</font>

262
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,740
paying yourself on my colleagues<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

263
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,270
and the peering policy right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic</font>

264
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,580
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not appearing policy for</font>

265
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,870
multicast so now if somebody's

266
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,110
interested all you have to do is talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

267
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:29,690
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> for now so not a big problem and I'm</font>

268
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,860
sure if in the near future probably

269
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,510
there's got to be some politics so for

270
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:40,850
now there's not don't worry about and

271
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:43,520
then I'm oh yeah the first one up for

272
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the and I'm basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we're</font>

273
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,069
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work it out is that big</font>

274
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,240
customers that are wrecked right now in

275
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,709
our legacy mmm poem machines we're going

276
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hope are we going to try to get them</font>

277
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:57,739
eventually to a pimp configuration

278
00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:01,540
probably for stance than sparse and if

279
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,540
any new customers want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring up there</font>

280
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,109
you
