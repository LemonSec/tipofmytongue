00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,399
haven't tried the technology yet also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,140
had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions during the</font>

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,710
break of how does one get to talk at

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,670
nanog well send mail to nano support and

26
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,990
generally we send the mail out to a

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,760
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other folks to look it over</font>

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,580
and see if the abstract would be of

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">interest so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how you get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speak</font>

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,979
it in just want to reiterate while we're

31
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,979
waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's okay</font>

32
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:36,530
just 12 just wanted just one to

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:41,240
reiterate a few points about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> near</font>

34
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:44,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">las mailing list and really that say are</font>

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:48,079
you liking me if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to</font>

36
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:50,149
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say we have a so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

37
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this big push that again a lagina</font>

38
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:54,079
along is just growing way out of Bounce

39
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,970
so well there's been number of

40
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,538
suggestions about what we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

41
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do about the mailing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list and what we</font>

42
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:02,750
started doing is sending a gentle

43
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,490
reminders now and then and some minion

44
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,799
on staff and you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really isn't</font>

45
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,769
on topic or are you probably shouldn't

46
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,480
use those words in public email or

47
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:13,580
things of that nature and there's some

48
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,329
success to that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing that</font>

49
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:20,000
seems to work is public ridicule and I

50
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,060
think we've got Randy bush and Jayhawk

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,519
and others thanks for this but it also

52
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,410
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of email volume and generally</font>

53
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,750
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> public ridicule also is not</font>

54
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,750
operational email so what I would

55
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually prefer is private ridicule if</font>

56
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,940
you do think someone's topic is way out

57
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,798
of bounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it to them privately vent</font>

58
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,230
your anger your frustrations whatever

59
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,720
the five or six thousand people on an

60
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,700
analyst really don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that so</font>

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,560
private ridicule if you don't really

62
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,170
need to ridicule private is preferred

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,530
over public so sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> public is more</font>

64
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,780
successful it's also been suggested that

65
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,329
we kind of randomly drop or base the

66
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,209
filtering based on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> the originator</font>

67
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:04,630
do some type of random early discard but

68
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,859
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> little hesitant to start actually</font>

69
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,569
we're big believer that the mailing list

70
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:11,090
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open forum for discussion</font>

71
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:13,880
of ideas and operational topics so a

72
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:18,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">little hesitant to actually begin any</font>

73
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,940
type of heavy-handed moderation there's

74
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,069
also been a number of discussions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

75
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,500
may be sending it up a group of ten or

76
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,839
eight or six moderators any one of whom

77
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,250
could approve a message so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> burden</font>

78
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,190
would be shifted<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of people</font>

79
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,630
and they would not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nana's are but</font>

80
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,000
we're also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little reluctant to do that</font>

81
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,590
there's a few technical issues and we

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,800
really rather not go the moderation

83
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:43,170
route I think our preference is

84
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,820
that is risk now I know you really want

85
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to send my mail out I really think that</font>

86
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,459
does that do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that does everyone on</font>

87
00:03:48,630 --> 00:04:00,720
the mailing list really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

88
00:03:50,460 --> 00:04:04,350
email and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with that will now</font>

89
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:10,710
have our first<font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon talk with Kathy</font>

90
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:15,690

100
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:51,719

101
00:04:43,800 --> 00:05:01,050

me hello what oh there did so hi I'm

103
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:10,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kathy wickless I looked at home the evil</font>

104
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:12,470
cable Empire and and as ed says and I'm

105
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,669
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit about some</font>

106
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,890
interesting happenings that we had when

107
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,919
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to configure this Cisco</font>

108
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,120
proprietary feature called car and there

109
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,979
seems to be a lot of interest so I

110
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,600
thought I'd presented here and the

111
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,000
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day is whether he's</font>

112
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,560
afraid of the car excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the car</font>

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,060
or the car is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run them over and</font>

114
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:37,380
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can decide that for yourself so I</font>

115
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,669
was your night go the wrong way<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

116
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,150
so first of all I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

117
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:45,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's caught what car is what we did to</font>

118
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,270
test in the lab the rate limit

119
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,849
parameters that we use and how we said

120
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,039
them the different tests that we did

121
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,970
this is just pretty much an overview so

122
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:59,540
um and some performance issues there are

123
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,160
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is car it's a</font>

124
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,980
token bucket mechanism and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk</font>

125
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:08,240
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more a minute</font>

126
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:10,070
that does a number of things it does

127
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,320
packet classification so you can set

128
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,950
tossed it to the packet header and it

129
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:19,219
also does for some definition of rate

130
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:21,289
limiting it does rate limiting I can

131
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,440
it's configured on a pro interface basis

132
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,000
in or out it's a weight limit but you

133
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,040
can the rate one that most of what we

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,950
did muscle testing we did was the rate

135
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,290
limiting testing because we had some

136
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:36,170
managers who felt that we could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

137
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,910
in interesting ways in our network so

138
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,590
that the rate limits are based on

139
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,150
extended access we'll sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard</font>

140
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,500
things you can also set talk of it

141
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,840
somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weight limit</font>

142
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,920
based on those or quantify them again

143
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,719
based on those so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can set you can</font>

144
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,940
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking ahead of</font>

145
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,920
myself there's this URL you can actually

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">search for it on their web page if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

147
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,400
want to read the marketing stuff but I

148
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:03,140
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I don't</font>

149
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:06,409
work there so more about car the rate

150
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,180
limits are defined there are several

151
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,830
parameters when we started to configure

152
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,420
this we asked Cisco you know how do you

153
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,830
configure this and they said oh well you

154
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,210
know you configure it and we said no

155
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,789
really how do you configure it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

156
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,340
said no<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just configure it so we</font>

157
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,140
decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of guessing we</font>

158
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,210
would go in the lab and<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font>

159
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">to configure it so there's several</font>

160
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,539
parameters there's the rate that you

161
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,590
want to have in the rate limiting stuff

162
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,060
there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> race that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

163
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,310
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the average over a particular</font>

164
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,630
interface and based on whatever

165
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,940
classifications you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on that</font>

166
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,680
interface and then there's these config

167
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,150
parameters normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus boost and</font>

168
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,850
extended books and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk a lot about</font>

169
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,159
those in a minute and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then based on</font>

170
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,600
those those you can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions about</font>

171
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,360
what it is that person<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to drop</font>

172
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,890
packets to transmit packets and all

173
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,530
those sorts of things or you can drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

174
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,419
into another rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> q if you're so</font>

175
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,010
inclined and you can have a bunch of

176
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,810
weight limits / interface but as you'll

177
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:00,349
see the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

178
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,720
interesting again so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> caught what</font>

179
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,410
car

180
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,750
isn't is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic shaping mechanism so</font>

181
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,130
if you expect it between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two letters</font>

182
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,930
that are running<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're you</font>

183
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,180
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the tcp speakers are going</font>

184
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,940
to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the link is actually</font>

185
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever rate limit you set your wrong</font>

186
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:19,469
it lets you burst and then drops packets

187
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:24,900
but we'll talk about that some more it's

188
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:26,880
not what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would call qos but then it's</font>

189
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:31,140
also not a performance enhancement for

190
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:34,469
your routers but if I collapse one or

191
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:37,110
two and a couple additional bullet it's

192
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:43,080
not a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the address based</font>

193
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:47,640
conspiracy and and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped postal</font>

194
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,920
mail spam so so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit</font>

195
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,480
about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> tolkien bucket works because</font>

196
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,729
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really relevant to what we</font>

197
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,710
found in our testing my consulted the

198
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,260
king of clipart<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

199
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,380
whimsical at<font color="#CCCCCC"> clip art so in the</font>

200
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,760
configuration parameters the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit for</font>

201
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,590
second way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you said on your right</font>

202
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,170
limit is basically help us the tokens

203
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,790
are falling into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bucket okay so</font>

204
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,530
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> red dots and then the</font>

205
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,610
normal births parameter is how high the

206
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:16,319
bucket is and the the way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> works is</font>

207
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,050
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there if the package</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going by</font>

208
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's enough tokens that represent</font>

209
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,729
the size of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pakistan you know the</font>

210
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,890
tokens in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet passes or conforms</font>

211
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,390
whatever your conform you can transmit

212
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,160
you can set precedents you can do a

213
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of things and if there are tokens</font>

214
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,439
then you know it does whatever your

215
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,230
exceeds is drops or that's presidents or

216
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,640
puts it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in another rate Q and there's</font>

217
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,440
also another parameter that I'll talk a

218
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,589
lot about which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the extended bucket</font>

219
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,260
which lets you kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> steel tokens in</font>

220
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:49,370
interesting ways does anybody have any

221
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,080
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have questions feel free to ask</font>

222
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,330
so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it configured it's a regular</font>

223
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">old interface</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco configuration</font>

224
00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:02,250
command with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal births extended</font>

225
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,600
birth succeed action so like I said with

226
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,680
the token bucket in this configuration

227
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:12,330
the normal versus what conforms and the

228
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:15,099
extended versus headed from<font color="#E5E5E5"> skill tokens</font>

229
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,380
this is what our topology will look like

230
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:22,150
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lab we had to be spi boxes</font>

231
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:24,189
running ttc p and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp trace and actually</font>

232
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,630
we first did just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know testing to</font>

233
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,910
see if it would make<font color="#E5E5E5"> our leathers roll</font>

234
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,920
over and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a a test in a</font>

235
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,170
market that we you know we didn't have

236
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,729
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying customers in and then we went</font>

237
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,199
back into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lab</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and said gee we better</font>

238
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,460
be more scientific about this because

239
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things happening that</font>

240
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,200
we didn't understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we did was</font>

241
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,670
the car the rate limit has this great

242
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,590
laser pointer was placed here and we

243
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,209
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending traffic across this and</font>

244
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a 10 megabit interface that was</font>

245
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:55,420
rate limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 128 k for this test but</font>

246
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the the rate limited the</font>

247
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,360
behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same regardless of what</font>

248
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,890
the right when it was and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you</font>

249
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,720
why so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> test we did was we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

250
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,130
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the normal that's at</font>

251
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> height of the bucket we didn't want</font>

252
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at you know borrowing tokens so</font>

253
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,010
if you set the normal growth in the

254
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,990
extended<font color="#CCCCCC"> birth to be the same then there</font>

255
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">is no extended bucket</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's</font>

256
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:19,150
what we did in these tests and we did

257
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,860
multiple test of sending traffic across

258
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,750
that interface at each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

259
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">points on the glass</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and there are three</font>

260
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,250
different things going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> here the top</font>

261
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,910
line<font color="#E5E5E5"> the red line is really your</font>

262
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,770
throughput and then is it the magenta

263
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:37,480
line is the number of retransmits and

264
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:39,460
the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> line is the number of exceed</font>

265
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,500
packets so we were actually looking at

266
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:45,130
there's a car nibs and we were actually

267
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at you know what what actually</font>

268
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:50,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what there were no tokens so</font>

269
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,720
you know it exceeded and so then it got

270
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,199
dropped and what you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this</font>

271
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,970
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you get to about 2400 k for</font>

272
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">the normal for the bucket</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> height it</font>

273
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,400
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> levels out and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see</font>

274
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,930
biggest along occurrence of events

275
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,699
figured out why that is but if you also

276
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,839
look if you don't use the extended

277
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,839
bucket at all you end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

278
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,800
twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent retransmits and depending</font>

279
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,070
on where you put this in your

280
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,839
infrastructure that means that you know

281
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,310
over time you're getting 128k or

282
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,680
whatever but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're sending a lot more</font>

283
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,239

284
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">conserve bandwidth you should be really</font>

285
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,069
careful where you're putting it

286
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,660
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a tcp trace and the only</font>

287
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">point of this is that the slope of the</font>

288
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,439
line even though you as will zoom in

289
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's some interesting things</font>

290
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:36,219
happening the slope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the line really</font>

291
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,740
is whatever you're right limit is and as

292
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,399
you zoom in what you end<font color="#CCCCCC"> at what you see</font>

293
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,529
is that you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> spending and then and</font>

294
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,790
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all tcp traffic</font>

295
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:48,069
because UDP doesn't have this

296
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,349
characteristic and then TT peel back off

297
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you dropped packets but you</font>

298
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,149
sucked all the tokens out of the bucket

299
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,829
you drop the packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP backs off for a</font>

300
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,399
second and a half that's how long that

301
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:01,329
flat line is you get to read you get the

302
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,579
retransmits back you start opening the

303
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,699
window again you drop the packet and it

304
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:08,769
just keeps happening over and over so

305
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just a little bit closer so</font>

306
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:13,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can see the little packets and a</font>

307
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,149
little retransmitted fun and we did a

308
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:19,509
couple other a couple other pests along

309
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:22,059
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are interesting comparing</font>

310
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:24,970
cards traffic shaping which remember we

311
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:27,219
said color wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic shaping and if</font>

312
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,749
you look at we did the same test<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

313
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">way we didn't zoom in we do the same</font>

314
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:35,259
test with we did a read traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> shake</font>

315
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:36,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">the PVC across that test lab and we did</font>

316
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:38,529
a similar test and of course it's

317
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">chopper tapes it doesn't flop pack it</font>

318
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:42,429
doesn't weight limit by dropping packets

319
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:44,499
it just slows things down so that the

320
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">equipment thinks that it's a slower link</font>

321
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:50,529
and if he caves a lot better we also did

322
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,540
some generic traffic shaping test cisco

323
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,370
has this feature generic chef traffic

324
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,370
shaping although it doesn't have a many

325
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,569
knobs and it's so switched but some of

326
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,550
the new stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they may be doing</font>

327
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">uses is so we wanted to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it</font>

328
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:06,490
behaves and it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his so the</font>

329
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">next thing that we did was we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

330
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,019
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the extended bucket and</font>

331
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,730
there's a lot of gory details here we

332
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,559
said gee how does the extended bucket

333
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,490
work and they said can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get back to</font>

334
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:21,129
you so we started testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it and</font>

335
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:24,040
actually these are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

336
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:25,360
web so there's a lot more detail for

337
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,439
this but basically the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> steel</font>

338
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,799
tokens and you have this thing called

339
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:31,719
compounded<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet and you know instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

340
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:33,910
draw instead of running out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tokens</font>

341
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,660
and dropping all the packets you drop

342
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,550
one

343
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,410
based on this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> borrow some and then</font>

344
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,689
it's more like they say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like</font>

345
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:44,740
red but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't really convinced to</font>

346
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:46,569
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway it does behave quite a</font>

347
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,579
bit better so what we did was<font color="#E5E5E5"> we left</font>

348
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,620
the normal births a 24k because that's

349
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:53,319
what levels out and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

350
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,939
messing with the extended burst and what

351
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:58,000
we found this is a similar graph as

352
00:14:54,939 --> 00:15:00,670
before as you as you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out in the</font>

353
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">increments of modifying the extended</font>

354
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,829
burst you can get the retransmits down

355
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:08,099
to about seven percent which is you know

356
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:10,060
a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> well behaved and the</font>

357
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,920
retransmits and the Exede packets

358
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,899
coincide you don't end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with more</font>

359
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,979
retransmit sonic seed packets which is

360
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:21,370
probably a good thing and what we found

361
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:24,550
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the extended bucket should be</font>

362
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:27,459
twice<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal bucket and we thought a</font>

363
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:30,819
lot about why that is and what you set

364
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:33,369
the normal the height of the bucket at

365
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:35,589
and as it turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope it's the next</font>

366
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,860
slide oh these are some zoom<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like</font>

367
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:42,759
before you can see the little retransmit

368
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:44,079
there less of them oh I guess I won't

369
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,290
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the punchline now we'll talk</font>

370
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,209
about multiple strain side so that we

371
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,500
did some tests we did a couple tests

372
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:54,939
that I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides on we did a</font>

373
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:57,880
test injecting delay and the results

374
00:15:54,939 --> 00:16:01,300
were really similar we also did multiple

375
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,560
streams because one of the things for

376
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,229
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worse that people were</font>

377
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about doing with this is there</font>

378
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,600
was a misconception among some of my

379
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,660
co-workers that the way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> works is</font>

380
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,279
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know every individual flow got</font>

381
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,899
a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of bandwidth but really</font>

382
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,399
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bulk saying right so if</font>

383
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,380
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only guy talking and you</font>

384
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,660
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't suck up all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tokens</font>

385
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,240
then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

386
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:29,110
notice but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we did was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we took these</font>

387
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,639
you took one stream at 128 to it twice

388
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three eight three</font>

389
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">times that and found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they kind of</font>

390
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">sync up and drop at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time over</font>

391
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,240
time and they each get about you know

392
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">one third with three of them one third</font>

393
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,899
of whatever your rate limit is and the

394
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:44,920
packet loss is really you know the

395
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,200
retransmits

396
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:51,969
much the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's consistent it</font>

397
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:54,550
seems consistent with multiple flows so

398
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,649
what we can't what we what we discovered

399
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,810
was that the height of the bucket is how

400
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,370
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> tokens can fill it up in a second</font>

401
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,260
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half because that's how long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

402
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:07,299
takes to back off and that's why it's

403
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:09,730
2,400 k with 128 k rate limit and then

404
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:12,339
the extended bucket is twice set so we

405
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,870
came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this little formula that I</font>

406
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:19,770
guess Cisco gives out to their customers

407
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:25,928
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it made it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the way to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Belgium</font>

408
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:28,690
and so let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what did we do so</font>

409
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:30,250
then what we did was we we put some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

410
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,049
this in the field accepted instead of

411
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,720
dropping packets we transmitted for

412
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:36,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">exceed for the Exede action and the</font>

413
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,830
conform action we transmitted instead of

414
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,379
dropping just to see kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

415
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">effects on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment would be and we</font>

416
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,270
put tools in place to watch like VIP cpu

417
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:51,729
utilization exceed towners all those

418
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:54,700
sorts of things and so we use to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7500 no</font>

419
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:58,540
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> surprise they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really busy</font>

420
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:01,510
routers which is interesting we had

421
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,340
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it I'll cyclic out in</font>

422
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,400
a minute and we used<font color="#CCCCCC"> five different</font>

423
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,990
right classes you kind of have to

424
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,549
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what you're doing because</font>

425
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,410
you know you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that the</font>

426
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:12,639
stuff that you don't want if it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

427
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,620
block of address space that you're

428
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,270
affecting by the next rate limit you

429
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,469
know order is important so you have to

430
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,710
play these games with these weight

431
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:24,340
limits that you never intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

432
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:26,679
so what did we find the essa as the

433
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,959
filter rice and the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of Q's</font>

434
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,470
got bigger the performance cut more

435
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,470
interesting

436
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,039
the more to use like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said the more</font>

437
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:43,299
cheese you have the more interesting

438
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:49,779
that that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather be his fifth 250</font>

439
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:51,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">seems better let's see we we started</font>

440
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:52,840
seeing I'll show you some graphs are

441
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,510
pretty interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this really you</font>

442
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,939
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> high that cpu who watches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that cpu</font>

443
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,950
utilization has anybody gotten any

444
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:06,519
useful information out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco about</font>

445
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:08,409
what it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> finishing the graph well</font>

446
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">apparently a hundred percent bit cpu</font>

447
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:12,990
utilization doesn't necessarily mean

448
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,279
that your router is going to die<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

449
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,100
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really sure what it means if</font>

450
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,470
anybody has any input to that would be

451
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,658
really interesting and if you have more

452
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,669
traffic going in one interface and out

453
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:27,159
the other than it does is queuing on the

454
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:28,539
zip which makes a cpu go up and if you

455
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,370
had one hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent if you send more</font>

456
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:32,679
traffic it's supposed to get better but

457
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">i don't quite understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but i</font>

458
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,010
guess it's more that you can do in an

459
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:40,779
interrupt and the better it performs and

460
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,129
like i said depending on where you put

461
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in the infrastructure you could be</font>

462
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,799
generating a lot more traffic than you

463
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:51,070
think you are here a couple graph of

464
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:54,668
some VIP cpu utilization that actually

465
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:57,220
we see with car turned off that we've

466
00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:01,090
been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and the top</font>

467
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:03,760
line is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent so i don't</font>

468
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,110
know who watches it but if you be

469
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,940
interested in talking to folks about

470
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,809
what they see and what they think it

471
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,760
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> so one thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do use this</font>

472
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,470
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think we're going to use it</font>

473
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,149
for what we originally intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

474
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,330
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for but one of the things we've done</font>

475
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:22,149
really useful is we rate limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICMP at</font>

476
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,490
the interconnects and we plot the Exede

477
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:27,039
exceeds and we have alarms in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NOC</font>

478
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,380
that say you know the right limits being

479
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,330
exceeded and we watch all the attacks

480
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,870
but they get dropped at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge very</font>

481
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:37,418
cool and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you know how much</font>

482
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,709
and track them down because but it's not

483
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,059
melting down in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

484
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,710
infrastructure which is pretty useful

485
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:43,360
when you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of this formula</font>

486
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,929
for that because it's icy empty and who

487
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">cares how many you drop and i would</font>

488
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:50,580
suggest using it maybe

489
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,740
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> English filtering but I</font>

490
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,629
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it for you know the balance</font>

491
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,600
of our traffic is from the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

492
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,890
in a lot of cases so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't do you a</font>

493
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,870
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good too late land that</font>

494
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,220
what goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're just you're</font>

495
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,939
sucking down a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

496
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:10,080
sending some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the new cable modem gear</font>

497
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,000
uses car from a particular vendor that

498
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,669
we know and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that</font>

499
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:27,570
fixed so anyway that's what I had to say

500
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:30,050
Oh any questions Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> shock I have two</font>

501
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:34,139
questions both theoretical unfortunately

502
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:36,810
first as<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-part were somebody to</font>

503
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,430
give you a tool whereby you can impose a

504
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,260
traditional leaky bucket in front of

505
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,270
your association of your collection of

506
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,770
token buckets so that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

507
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,540
smooth out the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have it</font>

508
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:48,090
behave as if it was an interface with

509
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:52,440
been with X with this be very useful for

510
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:58,260
you if it had it means to good or not

511
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:59,820
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> knobs then and you know but yeah</font>

512
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,980
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know whether we would</font>

513
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,080
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy an external box or not it's</font>

514
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,100
a tense signal well I imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your</font>

515
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,409
vendor would do this wherever your

516
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,389
vendor happens to be right I mean

517
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,830
traffic shaping is what for what we were

518
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,320
doing traffic shaping with what we were

519
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,639
looking for and this is not that wait so

520
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,020
you are looking for traffic shaping as

521
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,920
well which is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is</font>

522
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:21,840
simple take notes<font color="#CCCCCC"> poll how long a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> queue</font>

523
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,850
would you expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have in front of the</font>

524
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,189
the traffic shaping leaky bucket and

525
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,500
what kind of queue management would you

526
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,910
use like red or maybe something else

527
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,440
longest lines do you have any thoughts

528
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:36,960
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um I haven't really thought</font>

529
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,850
about it probably probably read and I I

530
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,560
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to look more</font>

531
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,090
some of this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been sort of an</font>

532
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,710
adventure<font color="#CCCCCC"> in looking at all of our</font>

533
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,720
different kinds of traffic and trying to

534
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out you know what makes sense and</font>

535
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,830
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really sure if i can speak to</font>

536
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,560
that yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay because we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to</font>

537
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,908
the same things yeah the other question

538
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font>

539
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:58,220
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed somebody where you to give</font>

540
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:59,869
you another<font color="#E5E5E5"> control plane where rather</font>

541
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,389
than a set or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hierarchical or</font>

542
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:04,459
rule-based collection of token bucket

543
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:06,559
swear you can have a certain class of

544
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,119
traffic interact with bucket<font color="#E5E5E5"> X certain</font>

545
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,070
class of traffic and directors bucket<font color="#E5E5E5"> y</font>

546
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,720
and so forth you get a further

547
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,820
fine-grained interaction with each

548
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,769
individual token bucket where you can

549
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,279
wait any<font color="#E5E5E5"> given traffic yeah that was a</font>

550
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:21,769
certain number of tokens great yeah yeah

551
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,139
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> new technology needs more</font>

552
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:25,729
knobs right I mean you know it's not

553
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:27,349
real it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a whole life to</font>

554
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:29,149
think it's different ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this I</font>

555
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:31,009
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking listening to the caching</font>

556
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:32,629
talk right I mean you want to incent

557
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,979
people to use the cash well how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

558
00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:35,629
do that you make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic that</font>

559
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:39,080
doesn't go through certain kinds of

560
00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:40,428
traffic this should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be cash worse if</font>

561
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,139
they don't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the cash you know</font>

562
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:46,700
stuff like that so well you know it's

563
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:48,649
not my idea okay no but you know I mean

564
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:52,099
come on we've all thought about it you

565
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:53,689
know I mean that passes and thirty

566
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:56,840
percent performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you better make</font>

567
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:59,359
it worth their while right so so so just

568
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,889
on exactly that note<font color="#E5E5E5"> to summarize maybe</font>

569
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,499
there are a couple providers who think

570
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:06,049
that a stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> based network is not</font>

571
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:07,940
optimal and that having better tools to

572
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:10,279
shape and manage traffic is a good thing

573
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,799
because it's not shaping traffic it's

574
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,419
facilitating other traffic flows put the

575
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,849
marketing people told me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I believe</font>

576
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:19,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know that's what</font>

577
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:21,019
it's all about right vendors both the

578
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:27,619
sea vendor and other potential vendors

579
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:31,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">technically I did want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a comment</font>

580
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:33,918
about where it is useful to put this in

581
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:37,340
and one of the places that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it</font>

582
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:40,220
useful was at the at the customary

583
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,189
ingress absolutely specifically to drop

584
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,809
traffic that's not going to be returned

585
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,359
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea sir right right we</font>

586
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:50,418
can magic jack at all yep absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep</font>

587
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,879
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you get a symmetric traffic</font>

588
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:54,259
flows and this could be at a data center

589
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:55,849
or it could be at a customer ingress

590
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:58,489
point where you're getting a lot of

591
00:24:55,849 --> 00:25:02,269
requests in but then you're choking with

592
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:04,570
the responses back you can rate limit

593
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:08,440
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inbound request</font>

594
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:12,428
to tune it so that your outbound

595
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:16,370
responses don't congest but you're

596
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:19,370
flaking off the request as far outside

597
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,840
of your network as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and you</font>

598
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,610
can also save your servers that way

599
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,620
because they're not processing as many

600
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:27,620
requests and not having to retransmit

601
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,149
their response traffic right thing you

602
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to watch when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that though is</font>

603
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:33,439
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you're if you're rate</font>

604
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,539
limiting the request you want to put

605
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,289
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as close to the outside as you can</font>

606
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:41,990
and putting putting that and on a busy

607
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:46,820
interconnect router is not an optimum

608
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:49,159
thing to do trust me oh yeah it's

609
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,080
definitely best to put it at the thin /

610
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:53,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">area to epic but if you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a</font>

611
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,299
customer and it's in down then you take

612
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:58,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hit of all the retransmit so but the</font>

613
00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:01,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue then is also if you've got a very</font>

614
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:03,590
broad periphery accessing the center of

615
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,019
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> network you can't identify a</font>

616
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,879
necessary can't identify all the

617
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:10,340
requests into the center of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

618
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,740
and coordinate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate-limiting all the</font>

619
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,740
way across your periphery right so it

620
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:17,779
does make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to put it in strategic</font>

621
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,179
places in the core of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network to</font>

622
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:21,559
guard your servers and it's also a fine

623
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:24,289
thing to think about when you're

624
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,809
addressing your servers that you might

625
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:28,908
want to do something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and you</font>

626
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:30,230
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got one of our vendors to make</font>

627
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:32,360
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have these you know this</font>

628
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,669
block<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of floated address space</font>

629
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,189
that's you know one line and a filter so

630
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:39,080
that you know when when they send out

631
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,399
one request can<font color="#E5E5E5"> that go outside our</font>

632
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,600
networks on these servers the source

633
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,489
address is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those well known</font>

634
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,120
addresses we didn't give them all the

635
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,889
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> address though anyway so so that we</font>

636
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,600
could put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as one wine and the right</font>

637
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:52,399
limit because otherwise you end up with

638
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">200 lines and then you're kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of host</font>

00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:58,219
Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jessie were quickly one thing in your</font>

640
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,620
slide that said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what car isn't</font>

641
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,539
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping I was waiting for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a slide</font>

642
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,000
to come along which didn't which perhaps

643
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:07,158
you can make a comment about now is that

644
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,059
car's not a dropper either so maybe you

645
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,490
could say a couple words on the

646
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:12,908
relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> between car and like wait</font>

647
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">read um</font>

648
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:17,320
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if I know what you're</font>

649
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:19,509
getting at I mean cars is certainly

650
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,229
marketed as a traffic shaper even though

651
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:24,609
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay bye Cisco I mean and I</font>

652
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:28,629
have light papers all over the place

653
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:31,359
should say so onion is a banging product

654
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:34,539
man only if you had a congested link and

655
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:37,119
you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something smart with it</font>

656
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:39,549
then sure you would want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> red or</font>

657
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,570
something but you know the goal of some

658
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:43,570
of the stuff we're doing isn't

659
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,950
necessarily to uncongested congested

660
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,649
link if that's what you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

661
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:50,590
to modify subscriber behavior and

662
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:52,748
differentiate services and so it isn't

663
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,949
necessarily that we have some sort of

664
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:58,570
saturated link that we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so</font>

665
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:00,609
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I mean I think Sean and</font>

666
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,529
I are both on the same page<font color="#E5E5E5"> with toten</font>

667
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:04,299
odds we'd like to see because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

668
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:06,220
doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know dealing</font>

670
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">something so yeah there is a big</font>

671
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:16,210
difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and and and a</font>

672
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:18,309
real congestion mechanism yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

673
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:20,379
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you could elaborate on your</font>

674
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:23,109
lab results on the performance

675
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:25,059
degradation on the 7513 at 7500 series

676
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:28,418
on the router you mentioned that ders

677
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:30,639
it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a two-part question the</font>

678
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:32,349
health of the hip processor versus the

679
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:33,789
overall processor off the router what

680
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:35,289
kind of performs degradation I each side

681
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:37,408
and how the VIP<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter interacts with</font>

682
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:39,690
that and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help control the car</font>

683
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:42,489
the second part of the question would be

684
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:45,159
what other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of car circuits would</font>

685
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:47,559
you just have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming in with one set</font>

00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:49,690
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> access-list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applying or cues applying</font>

687
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,249
to that circuit what were their multiple

00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:56,019
circus coming in with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other types of</font>

689

690
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:59,499
second part of the question as your

691
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:00,970
amount of car circuits grow how much

692
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:03,070
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a degradation on the overall</font>

693
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:05,619
router would you be seeing I don't know

694
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:09,330
if your lab results what we could

695
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:09,330
certainly speculate on some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

696
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:17,820
let's see where to start that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was big um</font>

697
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,920
the vistas most of the processing we

698
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,720
didn't see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of impact on the RFP</font>

699
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,650
cpu if that's what you're asking I mean

700
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,770
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most of the processing that</font>

701
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:32,970
we could tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is done under this if</font>

702
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:35,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's if there's enough if the traffic</font>

703
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,480
coming in I mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> add it's coming in</font>

704
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,070
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fields when we were doing</font>

705
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">transmit trends that we had it coming in</font>

706
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:43,590
on a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> busy router you know input</font>

707
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:45,450
on a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> busy interface output on a</font>

708
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,939
bunch of different for our interfaces

709
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:51,030
and if all that traffic if this there's

00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">it behaves better because it's not</font>

712
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,180
queuing up all the stuff that should be

713
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,770
going out and that's just without car

714
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:02,100
that's just in general so if you have

715
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:05,910
plenty of of egress then you know it

716
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:08,040
behaves better it seems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dips it</font>

717
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,350
had more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one interface it had a</font>

718
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,850
little bit more traffic I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the economies of scale of what you</font>

722
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,750
sort of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correlate actually one</font>

723
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,000
of the things I'm hoping to do is have a

724
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,310
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more you know information</font>

725
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,750
about correlating bit cpu is what's

726
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">really going on in the router and</font>

727
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:29,610
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco to help but it's been</font>

00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:31,740
really you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean speculative at</font>

729
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:35,429
best so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that answered</font>

730
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:39,060
your question it was long and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have no</font>

732
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,389
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question i guess the second part of</font>

733
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,000
the question was addressing the amount

734
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:47,580
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> car circuits you have coming ingress</font>

735
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,560
and egress versus just regular regular

736
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,379
circuits applied to the box that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

737
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,270
might not have car applied to was it a

738
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,470
mixture of circuits where were you just

739
00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:01,080
strictly looking at cars we were turning

740
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,820
it on on particular interfaces I mean

741
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,980
you know they're busy routers we only

742
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,820
headed on on one interface and then

743
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,280
there were a whole bunch of other

744
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,080
interfaces and some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VIPs that we</font>

745
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,000
had it turned on had another interface

746
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,800
on that same zip it wasn't running car

747
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,660
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say that we turned it on on</font>

748
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,919
more than one interface in a box<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

749
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,930
would suspect that if they're on

750
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,250
separate this it wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter because</font>

751
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:24,040
if it's have their own processor and

752
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,080
so as long as as long as you didn't have

753
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,389
I don't know two interfaces on the same

754
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">zip running car that could be bad I</font>

755
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,920
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd recommend that but so</font>

756
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,560
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we only had it on on one</font>

757
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:42,730
interface at a time so if you eyes

758
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:44,620
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> understands how the distributed</font>

759
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,540
Egbert buffering on the input card does

760
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,669
things so nobody will be able to answer

761
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,190
you I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make a</font>

762
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:52,780
comment and amplify your point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Paul</font>

763
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,880
in particular because he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one who</font>

764
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,560
raised the question the deficiency of

765
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,180
car is that it seems like a really

766
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:03,040
popular use of carp is to make it look

767
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,530
as if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less bandwidth available</font>

at an exchange point where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

777
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:30,040
in the link it's a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with car is</font>

778
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,890
that there's absolutely no buffering to

779
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,870
speak of in terms of the token bucket so

780
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:37,570
there's no timer based reaction on the

781
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:40,239
part of congestion avoiding traffic like

it's true it happens all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time so we</font>
