it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> very lightweight it allows</font>

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,019
for real-time registrations it's a text

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">only type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of system it will only require</font>

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,000
enough information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate presume</font>

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,789
files and identify which registrar has

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,189
what the names there'll be no contact

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,820
is this going to be lightweight<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,469
there's a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems and limits</font>

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,809
we're trying to move all this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to</font>

13
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,059
the register registrar's one is

14
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,890
internationalization is a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,620
that smooth to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> registrar so that you</font>

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,780
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have localization second thing is</font>

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,160
that privacy issues again<font color="#E5E5E5"> are moved to</font>

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,100
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Registrar because different</font>

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">different areas of the world have</font>

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,530
different sorts of policies during this

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,030
privacy and the next thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,340
can differentiate services between

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:05,010
registrar's more easily transport will

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">be through SSL and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a web</font>

25
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,860
interface available for the registrar's

26
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,530
for their particular reports now there's

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,720
a caveat and the caveat that is that

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,610
this may all change because there's a

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,289
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that amendment web and</font>

specifies in terms of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to</font>

31
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,340
happen with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this remote registry</font>

32
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:29,609
protocol the first thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nicko's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> report I have employed</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ten people will review a protocol and</font>

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,939
thinks may change out of that second

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,710
thing is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government needs to</font>

37
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,339
approve this that's where currently

38
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:44,280
stands and the third thing is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wipo</font>

how are your plans for doing backups of

how we're going to replicate our

there what comments you have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

hijacking you might call it a date like

66
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,390
of aol.com and what things are being

67
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,750
done to make that less likely in the

68
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,179
future there was a system that was

69
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two to two and a half</font>

70
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,630
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago called Guardian and there's</font>

71
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,220
that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail from which is easily</font>

72
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,269
spooked and that's basically what

73
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,109
happened AOL they were spooked by a a

74
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:46,260
particular person out there on the

75
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:47,940
internet the second time is is quit

76
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,920
password which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

77
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,459
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a password protection and a third</font>

78
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,530
type is PGP and depends how paranoid you

79
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,720
feel about this you certainly ought to

80
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,120
be looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> into guardian and user using</font>

81
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,310
cliff password or PGP based on what

82
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,489
sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go on pgp is</font>

83
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,680
actually fairly hard for people who are

84
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:11,840
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there first time dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort</font>

85
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,850
of thing but certainly the most secure

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,608
you cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a little bit i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

87
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,440
one of your comments but a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

88
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">months ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was there was this</font>

89
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,010
outfit that had mind your database

90
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,590
probably using who is or what

91
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,599
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to sell the whole thing</font>

92
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a CD and then there was a big uproar</font>

93
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,950
about it and they backed out do you have

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:39,020
any other comments about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm it's</font>

95
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,479
it's interesting because there's people

96
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,060
obviously have their own religious views

97
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,130
of what the status is meant for and with

98
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,400
this purpose and who owns it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

99
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,980
this other kinds of stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I you kind</font>

100
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,539
of have to play keeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information</font>

101
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,580
as restricted as possible but also

102
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,020
making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> available if you make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

103
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,880
available that allows for people like

104
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,240
Spanish to come in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually take a</font>

105
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,010
significant portion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it how did this</font>

106
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,660
is a game that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been playing for</font>

107
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,210
years restricting the number of queries

108
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,430
against who is this one restricting zone

109
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,169
file access is another and there may be

110
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,850
some more things going on the future to

111
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:19,670
try to restrict it even more so this

112
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:21,350
sort of abuse won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

113
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,550

115
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,570
stop selling my name as a contact to

116
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,670
various people for selling the IP

117
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,340
services because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really irritating</font>

118
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,770
to get paper mail spam that's obviously

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from other sort of registration</font>

121
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,590
you're moving these things so that the

<font color="#E5E5E5">I personally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would like to stop so in</font>

145
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,880
the ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we would have to do this</font>

146
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,630
is actually restricting zone coax

two<font color="#CCCCCC"> people out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even further and</font>

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,520
restricting to us access<font color="#E5E5E5"> even further</font>

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:45,440
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly be an outcry if we</font>

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that there actually was also</font>

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,900
a job posting for somebody posted i

<font color="#CCCCCC">think tonight certainly to IETF of a</font>

was referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to on that first one but</font>

156
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,000
let's concentrate on the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

157
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,820
second one if you followed our<font color="#CCCCCC"> whois</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

one of the originator of that protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

159
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,420

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,740
mechanism in this next generation who is

to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> you towards the registrar who</font>

has your contact information two things

164
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,530
um some of the some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems</font>

165
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,650
previously alluded to I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think could be</font>

avoided<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you did not sort of conflict</font>

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:33,859
your private business contact data with

168
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,480
public information contact data I've see

169
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,350
no reason why you publish the building

170
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,350
contact for example in who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there</font>

171
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,610
should be an account with access for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

172
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,930
appropriate people and if they need to

<font color="#CCCCCC">change the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> building contact they can</font>

175
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:52,490
of things my technical question is are

176
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,250
you ever going to implement before use

177
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,560
