the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually run full rate</font>

to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to private exchanges where they</font>

the problems you see today at some

68
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,879
popular exchanges have a whole lot to do

69
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:39,209
with what equipment is available what

70
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,518
works and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is driven by what</font>

it's all your fault Steve it's all your

77
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,440
fault telcos have a vested interest in

78
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:06,220
how things are deployed in the internet

79
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,680
internet technologies traditionally have

80
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,750
been media independent things will<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

81
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,440
over wire they'll run by carrier pigeon

82
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,709
I've seen proposals for running IP over

83
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,420
seismic seismic waves you don't have to

84
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,160
run over telephone company

85
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:25,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure but everybody does</font>

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:28,630
because it's cheap some other things

87
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,790
with exchange points you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do this in</font>

88
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,950
a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways if the</font>

89
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,360
popular ones have been unicast so you

90
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,700
basically throw things up and everything

91
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:42,250
runs unicast the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way God</font>

92
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:44,110
intended there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be some</font>

93
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,780
discussion in there and there are people

94
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at multicast exchanges</font>

95
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,849
and those tend to be bags on the side of

96
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,700
unicast exchanges for now because we

97
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,740
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite understand them and then</font>

98
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,700
there are is quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> of service or</font>

99
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,440
brokered bandwidth exchanges and these

100
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:07,440
hopefully we'll get one or more of you

101
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk about those kinds of things</font>

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,280
instrumentation and exchanges Casey

103
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,650
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> love for everybody to instrument</font>

104
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,919
their exchange yes you would don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> shake</font>

105
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">your head now because that's really now</font>

106
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,760
the place where people can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

107
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,310
decent measurement measurement<font color="#E5E5E5"> on back</font>

108
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,110
points tends to be problematic where

109
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,979
traffic actually crosses between

110
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,419
administrative bounds is interesting and

111
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,130
the way people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do instrumentation either</font>

112
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,140
put probes down these are for doing

113
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,050
things like packet analysis this gives

114
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:44,530
sort of a neutral viewpoint of what's

115
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,270
happening on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the switch media the switch</font>

116
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,880
the switch mesh that all this packets

117
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,820
are flowing across there are the

118
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,570
counters that count bits and they count

119
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:58,780
dynamic changes in in patent traffic

120
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:02,140
flow other instrumentation are things

121
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,359
like arbiters our route route servers

122
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,710
are out reflectors<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help in dispute</font>

123
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,900
clarification and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

124
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,789
to be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the people that on the</font>

00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,110
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make those useful for</font>

other people looking glass stuff shows

up at these kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things thanks dad</font>

about their various exchanges what

132
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,300
they've done what they're planning on

133
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,560
doing and what might be useful in the

134
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,480
future and Chris are you ready to start

135
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:42,360
helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> placate yes you have it on your</font>

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,959
actually physically located at the

186
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,399
of the exchange point and then you would

187
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,259
share a global DVM RP routing table to

188
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,839
do multicast routing across that tunnel

189
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:27,579
and distribute that internally so<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

190
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,500
that's been extremely successful in

right now so then what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,370
objectives that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

198
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,120
production multicast I'll talk a little

199
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,189
bit about that some of the design issues

200
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,649
and then a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least one</font>

201
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">exchange that is actually running</font>

202
00:10:49,649 --> 00:11:00,279
production our native multicast and

203
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:02,079
these design objectives so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideally what</font>

204
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,329
we would have in an exchange is support

205
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,128
for native multicast and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

206
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:08,109
ideally in the spirit of multicast would

207
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:11,769
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one copy of data</font>

208
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,050
across any particular length in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition</font>

209
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,850
we'd like to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use an e GP for</font>

210
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,639
inter domain routing like we do in

211
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,960
unicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then to use a variety of igp</font>

212
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,080
protocols in

213
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,600
domain like we do in unicast so a number

214
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of exchanges have moved to try and meet</font>

215
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,670
these production design objectives it

216
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:37,990
will take a look at a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

217
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:40,020
design elements now<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right the first</font>

218
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,060
thing is route exchange obviously the

219
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:46,030
the preferred choice for<font color="#CCCCCC"> EGP would be to</font>

220
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,589
use bgp if your multi casting across the

221
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,199
same interface that you would unicast

222
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,340
across or if you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could take</font>

223
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">advantage of the multi protocol</font>

224
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:57,040
extensions to bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> for plus so that you</font>

225
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,200
can specify a different multicast

226
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,780
routing information based to our PF

227
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,460
across a different interface so that's

228
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:07,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the route exchange protocol that's being</font>

229
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,620
used right now as<font color="#CCCCCC"> EG p or n bgp the</font>

230
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,380
second thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need to do is</font>

231
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,500
establish a treat multicast rebuilding

232
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,670
our most guests forwarding protocol and

233
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,550
tim is being used<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these exchanges</font>

234
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:21,819
in order to take advantage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp erm</font>

235
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,459
vgp but also it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the for use</font>

236
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,980
of whatever internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp is being used</font>

237
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,410
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> various appearing occurring</font>

238
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,710
providers there now initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> dense mode</font>

239
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:36,130
is being used on the interconnects about

240
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,020
why that's happening but but because

241
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,910
it's a flood and prune protocol ideally

242
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,010
what will be used as some sparse mode at

243
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,270
the interconnects so that brings us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

244
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,270
the third design element

245
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,979
so here's the issue if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are an</font>

246
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,959
exchange and you're peering across this

247
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,339
exchange one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

248
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do if you're a sparse mode</font>

249
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,220
environment is to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to learn about</font>

250
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,450
active sources in your peering partners

251
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,550
now currently what you can do is you can

252
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">co locate your rendezvous point at the</font>

253
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,800
exchange the exchanges in dense mode and

254
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,510
data from those peering partners is

255
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,329
flooded across the exchange thereby

256
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:19,079
providing information to your RP about

257
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:20,699
active sources in your peers but since

258
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're flooding the data this this is a</font>

259
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,389
fairly inefficient way of learning about

260
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">active sources in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet ideally</font>

261
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:27,870
what you'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do is simply have</font>

262
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:30,120
your peers send you a list of active

263
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,670
sources and then if you if you have

264
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,110
interested receivers in your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

265
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,510
can go ahead and have them join straight

266
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,550
back so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with what a number of</font>

267
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,160
exchanges have started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to set</font>

268
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:44,699
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> n msdp peering sessions the exchange</font>

269
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">then is put in sparse mode and and</font>

270
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:50,729
information is exchanged it out with in

271
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,620
terms of the media of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to</font>

272
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,449
meet the native multicast objective a

273
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,940
number of the exchanges have moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

274
00:13:54,449 --> 00:14:00,479
set up a dedicated fitty concentrated

275
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,079
and this is a fairly simple approach to

276
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,279
being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do native multicast</font>

277
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,439
providers who are interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in doing</font>

278
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,750
multicast across that exchange just

279
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,600
simply get another<font color="#CCCCCC"> fitty port they</font>

280
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,279
attach to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pity concentrator now what</font>

281
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens is since the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interface that</font>

282
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,519
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be multicast from is</font>

283
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,620
different than the interface that they

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,870

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,440
prefixes they're going to exchange for

287
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:29,189
multicast across that multicast internet

288
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,680

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:51,680
so for problems on that one go over our

331
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,790
history a little bit 1995 there were

332
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,149
about three there are three different

334
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:01,640
provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> was using a different carrier</font>

335
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:04,640
at the time so our round trip times were

336
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,500
100 milliseconds plus we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending</font>

news feeds to each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we need</font>

because we knew each other and there was

339
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,209
a discussion is there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better way to do</font>

340
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,640
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was coming up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the rep</font>

341
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,470
the next step of getting the rep<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

342
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,780
was convincing the other providers that

343
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,939
it's a good thing it seems to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

344
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,119
distrust sometimes among internet

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,940
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing routes in my opinion it is</font>

348
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:38,879
it is good today the Utah rep includes

<font color="#CCCCCC">ten providers the state of Utah has a</font>

the proper funding to purchase a switch

00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,690
most providers report that approximately

00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,510
ten percent of their traffic is sent

439
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:11,990
locally a lot of that traffic could be

440
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,640
included newspapers there's a few local

441
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,550
newspapers that get read pretty heavily

442
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,450
in our area and they're connected via

443
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:22,190
the local providers and then via the rep

444
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:29,600
usenet of course that's our distribution

00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,650
everyone understands that a local

exchange point keeps local traffic local

456

then we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> share local services news</font>

disadvantages fewer providers less

467
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:40,500
advantage I mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that's</font>

468
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:43,740
obvious the more providers that joint on

469
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,630
the better the exchange point becomes

470
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,770
and not i once again not enough local

471
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,840
clue who started to added a little bit

472
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">here advantage to larger providers</font>

473
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,100
especially on something like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> utah</font>

474
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:58,980
rep<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same as listed</font>

475
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,799
earlier local traffic never leaves the

476
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:04,020
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the ability to advertise local</font>

477
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:07,080

478
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,870
you were a large regional provider and

479
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:14,549
felt that well you'd like to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

480
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:16,949
exchange but your back bonus is larger

481
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:19,080
than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other providers well you can go</font>

482
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:24,029
to the exchange and only your local

483
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:28,500
routes from from that city and then it's

484
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:30,090
on an equal footing and then it is for

485
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,190
those marketing people it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> marketing</font>

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,889
you have a relationship with them

already once again some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

there needed to be a place to exchange

715
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,670
some local traffic and it needed to be

716
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:20,099
not cost prohibitive we currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

have any entry fee whatsoever just

matter whatever you want to drop in will

appear we assume MLP a bilateral pairing

720
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,530
of course is optional because you have

to work out your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> by level appearing</font>

there yeah okay talking mainly about my

<font color="#CCCCCC">that may seem that makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it different</font>

772
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:39,819
from what we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing before is</font>

773
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:41,919
that it was built to model private

interconnects point-to-point circuits

775

doing it with fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth</font>

783
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing that's different about</font>

784
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:08,828
it is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers are going to be</font>

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,859
provisioning their own circuits as soon

786
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:15,519
as we get this wonderful tool deployed

787
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:18,969
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working on for so long based</font>

on the web security audio de the main

789
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:22,449
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's exciting about it is that</font>

790
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:24,640
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will enforce both bilateral hearing</font>

791
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:26,170
agreements provider and provider be have

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,549
to agree before the circuit gets built

793
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:31,869
they have to agree on the size of the

794

795
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:34,749
been booked oversubscription on the

796
00:41:33,009 --> 00:41:36,039
switch so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't be able to point to</font>

797
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:42,459
us and say that our switch is dropping

798
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:44,380
here so right let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever why did we</font>

799
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:48,368
choose ATM a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asking</font>

800
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:50,380
me that can't figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out why we chose</font>

801
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:53,109
ATM because you can buy it off the shelf

802
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:57,729
today from multiple vendors so which is

803
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:59,529
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually work more or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less ATM</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

804
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:01,448
nice because it talks directly to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

805
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:04,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">on infrastructure yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a phone</font>

806

company as important but that also means

807
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:07,809
that there's no performance penalty for

808
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:10,390
peers who are not co-located in our

809
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:12,459
facility<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can run an ATM wire across</font>

810
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:14,900
the metropolitan area or even the white

811
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:16,220
area if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

812
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:20,799
the same as if it's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same room</font>

813
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:24,529
that sorta not the case city-based stuff

814
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,210
their upgrade paths available vendors

815
00:42:24,529 --> 00:42:29,900
are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with OC 48c capable</font>

817
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,119
start out going the existing hardware

818
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:34,130
will have some needs to move up to

819
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:40,279
that's again not the case of the

820
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:44,630
existing platform natm it<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly has</font>

821
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:46,819
its wart but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what they are had</font>

822
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,410
no experience with ATM so you can

823
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:51,230
understand what it can do well what

824
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:55,578
can't do well and we know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to</font>

00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:21,859
actually look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the individual traffic</font>

flows between pairs of customers for

835
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:24,828
appearing session essentially we can now

836
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:28,329
look and see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much traffic there</font>

837
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:28,329
isn't quite that back to the customers

838
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,819
we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have at Mae West's itm exchange</font>

the coral<font color="#CCCCCC"> OC 12-month box installed</font>

840
00:43:34,819 --> 00:43:40,339
thanks to kata and they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for</font>

841
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,558
a bunch of flow statistics research and

842
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:44,119
other interesting stuff and my hope is

843
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,520
at some point to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font>

844
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:48,200
actually analyzing things down at the

845
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,089
HTM level so it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on inside</font>

846
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,299
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch and in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> routers talking to</font>

847

this which is it is installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a trunk</font>

848
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:57,109
between two of the switches out of there

849
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,400
so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get a good aggregate</font>

850
00:43:57,109 --> 00:44:00,049
view of what's happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle</font>

of the exchange which something<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

instrumentation stuff since we're asking

854
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,990
customers to manage bandwidth if I it

855
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,740
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be only fair to tell them what</font>

856
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:18,348
they're actually using so I hope it's

857
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:22,430
all that collects the VC information and

858
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:23,450
puts it on a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> web page for them at</font>

859
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,399
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point those will be integrated back</font>

860
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,598
into the provisioning tool but that's in

861
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next phase</font>

862
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:31,190
and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> more information on the</font>

864
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:37,940
the city stuff there's a paper i did for

865
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:45,049
meeting a couple months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I'm is a</font>

to our marketing people for whatever

869
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:55,700
reason is what made<font color="#CCCCCC"> our networks as me</font>

870
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:59,899
WWE net is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the unofficial may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home page</font>

871
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:03,649
where the useful information is and this

872
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,880
presentation will be up somewhere the

873
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:11,359
official one as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I know doesn't</font>

874
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:12,470
exist yet anyway the presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

875
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:17,299
be up there I'm sure there'll be a

00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:19,729
pointer to it from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> notes page for</font>

877
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:22,630
this and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

878
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:30,859
except one less thing I can show you if

879
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:33,289
I can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is this one yeah</font>

880
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:36,650
this is an actual graph of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic going</font>

881
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:39,170
through the Midwest HTM platform ending

882
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,509
this morning we're peaking now a little

883
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,979
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 megabytes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> per second which is</font>

884
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:45,319
roughly one-tenth of what's going

885
00:45:42,979 --> 00:45:47,328
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> maze right now and that's</font>

886
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:53,619
probably with about six active peers

887
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:53,619
right now that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

888
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,750
so thank you

889
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:21,620
we need this with something

890
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:35,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know function can use with caution</font>

891
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:41,830
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you look down there cool stuff</font>

892
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:41,830
though no jokes no jokes with the rule

893
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:49,130
we only have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple minutes we're</font>

894
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,620
runnin outta time no jokes this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

895
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:54,790
serious this is serious<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

896
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:58,100
when I spoke with<font color="#CCCCCC"> doe Manning about what</font>

897
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:59,450
equinox is doing with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cgf project</font>

898
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,339
which is a commercial-grade internet

00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:03,319
facility project<font color="#E5E5E5"> he suggested it might</font>

900
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,480
be good to just give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys a heads up</font>

901
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:11,090
as to what's all going on with this

902
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:14,660
thing so the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> notion here come on</font>

903
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:17,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the basic notion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is there's a</font>

904
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:20,029
mission to see if we can help harden the

905
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:21,740
facilities in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that facilities and it's</font>

906
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,810
not a whole lot as your t-shirt shows

907
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:27,169
that we can do about the backhoes except

908
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:28,790
maybe give them rubber shovels or you

909
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:31,550
know ban them somehow we can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

910
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:33,200
about the links but we can do is focus

911
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,870
all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention on making the</font>

912
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,060
physical facilities for the internet a

913
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:39,290
whole lot more robust so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

914
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,690
what our mission is to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and help</font>

915
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:44,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">harden the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so one way to do</font>

916
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:46,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was by seeing you can find some</font>

917
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:49,220
folks to actually fund the mass

918
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,100
deployment of a large very large number

919
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:53,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">of really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solid robust internet</font>

920
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:57,410
facilities across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nation around the</font>

921
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:59,870
world we have venture capitals funders

922
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:01,940
who have a real interest in making sure

923
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:04,700
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet continue to scale and</font>

924
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,080
grow and be rock solid since we're

925
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,970
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something where millions</font>

926
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">of dollars is going to be transferred</font>

927
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:11,330
over the net they have a real strong

928
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:12,770
interest in doing that so a couple of

929
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:15,259
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been complaining as a</font>

930
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:16,759
community about have been how some of

931
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,650
the facilities providers don't

932
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,390
understand the IP stuff you know you

933
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,800
call them up then they say what's your

934
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:23,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">circuit number and you say I can't get</font>

935
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,130
access to my router<font color="#CCCCCC"> or facilities they</font>

936
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:27,020
say what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your circuit number and you</font>

937
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,120
know you have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of disconnect so</font>

938
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:31,520
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is put in place alert</font>

939
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:34,490
some of these facilities that have staff

940
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,140
of IP crew for folks and again we're

941
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,348
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some some fairly large</font>

942
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,150
sums of money going

943
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:41,849
this company to deploy these facilities

944
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:44,519
from the interested parties will talk

945
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:46,319
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> between 40,000 and 100,000 square</font>

946
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:48,868
feet facilities and to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> an idea</font>

947
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:50,190
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is Stan barber and I were just</font>

948
00:48:48,869 --> 00:48:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of figuring out how big this room</font>

949
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:55,079
is this is probably about 100 that were

950
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:57,809
about 10,000 square feet about 100 by

951
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:59,970
100 so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> facilities about four times the</font>

952
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:02,460
size of this on the low end going to

953
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:04,078
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the size of this room on</font>

954
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,839
the higher end so it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty large</font>

955
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,960
facilities here and again the number

956
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:12,089
talking about over the next two years or

957
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,579
so two or three years we've between 35

958
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:16,890
and 40 globally in the next five to six

959
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:19,859
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have probably</font>

960
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:21,299
about three located on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the east coast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

961
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:23,848
think the first couple are going to be

962
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:25,529
in Washington<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC and New York with other</font>

963
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:28,579
ones perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miami perhaps in Seattle</font>

964
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:32,400
we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get the final</font>

965
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:34,170
leases and stuff signed for that I don't

966
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,430
know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see these globally but</font>

967
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:38,670
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about a whole bunch so</font>

968
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:41,578
these going on into the Pacific<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rim for</font>

969
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:43,259
actually going into Australia the

970
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,819
details again if some of the global ones

971
00:49:43,259 --> 00:49:47,009
are so far out<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know prob about a</font>

972
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:48,808
year out or so that we can't get into

973
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:52,529
the specific details but we are looking

974
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work with the community to figure out</font>

975
00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:55,200
exactly where we ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have these</font>

976
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">things located because it's really what</font>

977
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,210
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter is as far as rules of</font>

978
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,430
engagement for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things we're really</font>

979
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:05,309
coming at this from a policy agnostic

980
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:06,930
standpoint that is without facility so

981
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:08,759
large that we're imagining you could

982
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:11,368
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra multiple nap facilities</font>

983
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:14,039
running in perhaps run by individuals

984
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:16,979
let's run by consortiums we heard of a

985
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:18,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of folks here that pool of</font>

986
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:20,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest together to operate things what</font>

987
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:22,369
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

988
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:25,259
facilities go in place whatever

989
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:27,150
colocation requirements are there if you

990
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:29,309
have folks who are looking to have a

991
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:31,670
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of presence a lot of times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

992
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:34,140
thing people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is adding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ups</font>

993
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:35,700
into their facilities we want to make

00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,589
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this facility rock solid and</font>

995
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,390
we want these facilities to be used so

996
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:42,119
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking a policy agnostic</font>

997
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:44,279
standpoint in terms of what folks can do

998
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:46,170
any facilities under couple of other

999
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:48,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">things I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think Dave you brought up the</font>

1000
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,910
the notion of a not-for-profit running

1001
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:52,619
these things we also have

1002
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:54,359
lot of ISPs say that they're concerned

1003
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:56,010
about who's running the physical

1004
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:57,690
facilities and who's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:50:56,010 --> 00:51:02,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">settlement and Brooklyn types of things</font>

1006
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:04,170
so we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in isp we don't operate a</font>

going to be acquired that kind of stuff

1009
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:11,460
is not in the in the cards so we're

1010
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,990
working again very much with an analog

1011
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,089
sort of tradition we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull</font>

together the interested parties the ISPs

the content providers and so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1014
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:20,669
highlighted a couple of value-added

1015
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,990
services because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one of the</font>

1016
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,819
things we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be working on</font>

1017
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:26,368
quite a bit will be the notion of

1018
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:31,170
hearing and settlement I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

1019
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:34,470
talk about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> here though in terms of</font>

1021
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:41,660
going to be multiple exchange points

00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:44,130
multiple types of interconnects between

1023
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,299
various folks we're sort of imagining it

1024

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to multiple disjoining</font>

1026
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,150
the terabit router companies see if that

1027
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:53,609
might be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right way to go switching</font>

an OC 192 sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels but at this</font>

1029
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:57,538
point we're really looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some</font>

1030
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:59,029
feedback from from you folks as to what

1031
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:02,730
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the appropriate technology is</font>

1032
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:06,510
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk too much about a</font>

1033
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:07,799
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things yeah yep yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1034
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:09,420
the last thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to mention again</font>

1035
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:12,000
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a heads up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to folks</font>

night and getting new facilities put in

1039
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:20,400
place and what we'd really like to do is

1040
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">see if we can share that information</font>

1041
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,910
back to folks so if you're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

your points of<font color="#E5E5E5"> presence are rocks house</font>

1046
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:33,328
we want to share the information that we

00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:35,609
have so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean Tomlin and Justin</font>

1049
00:52:35,609 --> 00:52:38,880
some feedback is a whole slew of

1050
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:40,020
trade-offs in your own internet

1051
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,089
facilities they're going to have to go

1052
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:44,430
through as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as raised floors the</font>

backup power AC and DC and so forth and

1054
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,819
why make sure the information gets on

1055
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:49,410
the table and hope for the box tonight

1056
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:52,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that we come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommendation</font>

1057
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:54,960
or some documentation the folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1058

chair and use<font color="#E5E5E5"> for constructing their own</font>

1060
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:02,368
that's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want to do just</font>

1061
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,620
sort of raised you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up on the</font>

1062
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:08,500
radar screen is coming up

1063
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:13,850
next five or six months no that's it

1064
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:16,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't go away a couple of closing</font>

1065
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:18,380
closing comments and then then we'll

1066
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:20,770
entertain obvious question and maybe

1067
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:24,350
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else if they have something</font>

1068
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:26,240
internet exchanges run the gamut I think

1069
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:32,089
you we've seen some of this today they

1070
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:34,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be as simple as a Moses a an</font>

intellectually challenged piece of media

1072
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,799
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that is the earliest exchange I</font>

1073
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:44,660
saw was a piece of yellow coax which

1074
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:51,710
dates me to some fairly high technology

1075
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:53,839
stuff not every type of exchange will

1076
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:56,060
meet every type of service providers

1077
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,610
needs and what we didn't talk about

1078

moving on to a different type of

00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:15,830
exchange for your traffic I mean that's

1084
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:20,810
important and how how that sees how easy

1085
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:22,330
it is to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of thing so we'll</font>

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,640
the question if if<font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix is bought</font>

1135
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:51,300
then you get the bank in Philadelphia

1136
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:52,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">Equinix whatever one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the e words if</font>

1137
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,760
they get back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bank and</font>

1138
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:58,170
Philadelphia to give every man I've

<font color="#E5E5E5">number a thousand dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1140
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">this it's not in the interests of the</font>

1142
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:09,360

behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> equinix asst is really the whole</font>

1144
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:14,340
purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the company is to stay</font>

1145
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:15,830
neutral and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that our</font>

1146
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:18,240
current business plan could function

1147
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:20,850
under the sole ownership of any

1148
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,439
organization it's also the cost of

1149
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:25,319
purchasing and company like<font color="#CCCCCC"> equinix</font>

1150
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:28,710
would be fairly high and most of the

1151
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:31,950
qualified parties are telecommunications

1152
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:35,430
right and that would compromise the the

1153
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:38,399
neutrality immediately so I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we</font>

1154
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:40,020
have a poison pill but but we have

1155
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:50,010
designed to business very carefully to

1156
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:52,980
discourage that it doesn't work anymore

1157
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:55,500
that's because bill used it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1158
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,760
worth now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

these facilities that you're building

1167
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:23,480
the problem of fiber cuts by having all

these facilities that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're building</font>

1169
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:37,580
it doesn't know the basic idea is that

1170
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:41,149
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things where it got links</font>

between facilities and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can too much</font>

1172
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:46,070
without protecting the facilities the

1173
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,960
links we can't ban the backhoes from

1174
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:50,540
expanding and digging up sidewalks and

1175
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:52,310
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do is harden</font>

1176
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,859
the facilities but make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the as</font>

1177
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:57,440
many points within the internet that

00:58:54,859 --> 00:58:59,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">have services that are important have a</font>

1179
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,680
rock solid infrastructure and then lunch

1180
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,390
will be sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next thing we've got</font>

1181
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">a target hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are taking</font>

1182
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:07,520
once and then they aren't to dig again

1183
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:09,560
but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 840 k is enough memory not</font>

1184
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be more right one of the things that</font>

1185
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,000
always found is that when your external

1186
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:16,730
links disappeared<font color="#CCCCCC"> even though you still</font>

1187
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,680
have the local connectivity is that you

1188
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:20,270
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get access to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns server so</font>

1189
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:24,230
a lot of times your local axis

1190
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:26,950
disappeared<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns might be</font>

1191
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:31,960
something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to consider sure sure</font>

1192
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:31,960
there are no urgent dns problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1193
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:40,670
actually gave a sexy idea question for

1194
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:43,760
you you talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some non bgp</font>

1195
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:45,080
traffic as<font color="#E5E5E5"> vicious parties doing that</font>

1196
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,430
kind of thing I maybe you could say a

1197
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,900
few words more about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we talking</font>

1198
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:52,669
about transit then over time with

1199
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:57,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">pointing default</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this does work</font>

1200
00:59:52,670 --> 01:00:01,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay um the intention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was to use private</font>

1201
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">a s to announce bgp or at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce</font>

01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:11,180
of statically routed non bgp speakers

1204
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:14,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one router that speaks bgp on</font>

1205

<font color="#E5E5E5">want to see bgp here we're not capable</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of speaking bgp or just don't know how</font>

1209
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:34,580
as long as the panel is asking other

1210
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:37,460
panel members questions John this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's</font>

1211
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:39,770
for you when<font color="#CCCCCC"> can I get rid of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this extra</font>

01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:41,450
switch fabric bag on the side for

multicast of just ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the same</font>

1214
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:51,710
switch fabric because I really don't

1215
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:54,410
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bag on the side yeah I don't</font>

1216
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:56,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that's a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and ideally</font>

1217
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:58,879
what we'd be able to do is run multicast

1218
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:01,490
and unique ask congruently over the same

1219
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,210
infrastructure but in you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1220
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:07,160
still some issues to<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve in</font>

1221
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:09,290
multicast forwarding and routing through

1222
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,569
a switching fabric so as soon as it's

1223
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:19,390
certainly at the interdomain space so

1224
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:19,390
good question<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1225
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:28,230
listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I've been struck by</font>

1226
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:30,210
the immense range my guess I'd almost

1227
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:33,330
call it the business plans from folks

1228
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:35,550
who basically can work as a don't charge

1229
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,590
for everything donate effort and time

1230
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:38,810
and it all works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our benefit the</font>

1231
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:41,670
folks were<font color="#CCCCCC"> all funded by venture</font>

1232
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:45,540
capitalists who in my limited experience

1233
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:48,960
rarely did things from pure altruism do

1234
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:50,970
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have a feel for is this main</font>

1235
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,250
lodge continuing indefinitely there's

1236
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:56,520
some definite trends to have access

1237
01:01:53,250 --> 01:02:05,120
points you know as a viable entity are

1238
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:07,590
going to move or grow<font color="#E5E5E5"> sterk down there I</font>

1239
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,270
think the trick at least for me was

1240
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:11,640
realizing that there is no

1241
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:12,870
one-size-fits-all exchange point and you

1242
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,549
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to define what your market</font>

1243
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:18,390
is and start building<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet those</font>

1244
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:20,550
needs and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to meet the needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1245
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:23,400
everybody on what you consider the

1246
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:24,780
extremes of what your model is there are

1247
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,700
the people who can do that quite capably

1248
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:30,540
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should focus on what you're good</font>

1249

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe there is a discussion on</font>

1250
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,800
nanog about I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a year or two</font>

1251
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:36,689
years ago regarding the total number of

1252
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:39,210
exchange points there would ever be some

1253
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:41,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">people said on the IBM theory you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never need more than 10 in the</font>

1255

<font color="#E5E5E5">world a lot of other people felt that</font>

1256
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:52,080
there may only be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really large ones</font>

1257
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:54,930
for various reasons art there may be

1258
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:57,120
some subset that are the largest by

1259
01:02:54,930 --> 01:03:00,960
several orders of magnitude by traffic

1260
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:04,560
volume however the benefits are real

1261
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:08,010
easy to demonstrate once traffic volumes

1262
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:12,120
get to four or five megabits on the

1263
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:16,640
local side and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-users start</font>

1264
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:18,900
having dsl connections for local traffic

1265
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,819
then that becomes pretty obvious what

1266
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,770
kind of traffic levels the small

1267
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,130
exchange points are looking at in the

1268
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:25,130
near<font color="#CCCCCC"> term</font>

1269
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:42,470
something works because as long as there

1270
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:44,479
are thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs in this country</font>

1271
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:46,220
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a requirement for</font>

1272
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,800
people to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and work out</font>

1273
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:51,310
problems to solve capacity issues and I

1274
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:54,590
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's really an issue of</font>

1275
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:58,490
people getting together to build an ISP

1276
01:03:54,590 --> 01:04:00,020
or an exchange point or going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to</font>

1277
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:01,939
other exchange points to exchange

1278
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:03,170
traffic in the technologies and use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1279
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:05,660
the models and use<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the exchange</font>

1280
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:07,190
point people are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do whatever</font>

1281
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:08,600
they have to to solve their connectivity

1282
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:10,869
issues and to get the performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1283
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,859
their customers are asking for and

1284
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:14,810
depending on where you're located you're

1285
01:04:12,859 --> 01:04:18,500
going to do whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1286
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:20,779
so the evolution of these exchanges is

1287
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,250
going to depend on what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1288
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and you know most of us are</font>

months from<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in six months from now</font>

1292
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:37,280
and a year from now we'll worry about in

1293
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:39,710
six months I think bill one of the one

1294
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,869
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that I see is there's a</font>

1295
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:44,500
whole class of Internet service

1296
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:47,330
providers that we don't see at nanog

1297
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:52,369
that may be well represented by my 15

1298
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:56,390
year old son and his friends they're

1299
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:59,800
doing exactly the same things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here did he's got a couple of</font>

1301
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:05,090
fairly low-end machines and he's managed

1302
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:09,820
to persuade me to buy in three telephone

1303
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:14,180
lines and he's got a profitable business

1304

selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet services to about 25 of</font>

early designs we've seen for internet

01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:33,430
exchanges tend to work fairly well<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1309
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:35,900
there traffic requirements don't need

01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:38,750
gigabits and terabits worth of switching

1311

availability from nine different telcos

1314

through hardened facilities they could

1315
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:55,010
care less they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to do</font>

1316
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:56,600
their gaming and so the designs<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1317
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:58,220
we've had and we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font>

1318
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,720
they will still have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> place they will</font>

1319
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:02,509
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a place in the market</font>

1320
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:04,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">but nan our cast and some of the designs</font>

1321
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:06,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have been talked about or more</font>

1322
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:08,780
applicable in other places which are not

1323
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,419
so prevalent particularly in North

1324
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:13,450
America they may be more applicable in

1325
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:19,250
Central America or South America where

1326
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:22,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the telco infrastructure is not as does</font>

1327
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:25,280
not reflect the North American model or

1328
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:27,170
where there are topological limitations

1329
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,140
such as Southeast Asia where you can't

1330
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:35,420
run glass between you know a hundred

1331
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:37,930
thousand islands so it's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool in</font>

01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,930
the toolbox

doing on time Craig I'm going to hand

anymore it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah champagne mr. okay</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay okay well thank you okay well we've</font>

1338
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:27,650
a few minute into the break just a few

1339
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:29,750
odds and ends if you do have any

please do not send the question genetic

01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:38,090
the ones who can<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you are nanog dash</font>

beer & gear and so are specifically

where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beer will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tonight the</font>

1350
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:55,939
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that is on the 10th floor all</font>

1351
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the elevators go there apparently I</font>

1352
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:59,510
don't quite have this hotel all figured

1353
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,339
out but all the elevators go to the 10th

1354
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:03,890
floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's called the skyline lounge and</font>

1355
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:08,390
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be lots and lots of beer so</font>

1356
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:12,379
that yeah and I yes and there'll be some

1357
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:14,120
vendor stuff but i should add to that I

1358
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:16,850
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have mixed feelings about this</font>

1359
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:19,040
beer and gear thing that we generally

1360
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:21,440
try to discourage large glitzy vendor

1361
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,939
sort of displays at nanog since there's

1362
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:24,379
lots of places for that I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1363
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:26,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">interrupt in Japan and it was great</font>

1364
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:28,520
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> women in</font>

1365
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:31,660
short skirt won't go there but you know

1366
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:34,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was all it was models and glitz and</font>

1367
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:36,559
nanog really has really a sort of

1368
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:38,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">research and education roots with the</font>

1369
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,240
NSFNET<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the most part we're trying to</font>

1370
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:43,250
stay true to our roots the beer in gear

1371
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:45,529
philosophy however is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1372
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:47,720
wanted a social period and we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

1373
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:49,399
to fund it so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to the beer</font>

1374
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,410
and we figured if we kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gear</font>

1375
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:53,939
low-key we could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beer so</font>

1376
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:55,889
other than that we really do try to

1377
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:59,099
remain sort of vendor neutral and not

1378
01:08:55,890 --> 01:09:00,830
have a large presence trying to think of

1379
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:05,190
this any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else I should</font>

1380
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:14,850
any organism explained it well what

1381
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:16,559
Mike's happen Susan 16 linger<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um as</font>

1382
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:19,020
the speakers come up later especially

1383
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">for panels but the people in back are</font>

1384
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:24,120
carefully watching what's going on up

1385
01:09:20,609 --> 01:09:25,920
here so as a person opens their mouth to

1386
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:28,470
speak up here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael magically know</font>

1387
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,240
and we'll come on for you so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

1388
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:33,990
eager and everything well works just

1389
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:36,740
fine and also speakers when you're up

1390
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:40,830
here and you're using your laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1391
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:42,779
what your what is look down at the

1392
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:45,000
screen rather than up and your face<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1393
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:48,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">be towards the audience the screen is</font>

1394
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,149
showing these are the same so look down

1395
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">just to check your signal thanks Susan</font>

1396
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:56,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did if speakers do have</font>

01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:04,530
put them up on the web hopefully as the

1400
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:06,540
talks go on I think we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> volunteers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest how to setup the</font>

see but hopefully we'll have that

1405
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:17,340
working today also those folks from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

and please make sure the aisle is clear

1412
