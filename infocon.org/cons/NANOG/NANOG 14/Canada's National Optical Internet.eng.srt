00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,540
and flow control the throttle back the

292
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,569
rather than doing pass protection

295
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:02,209

there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> queuing and so even traffic</font>

intrinsically self-healing and we know

330
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,750
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> crank down the timer's on the</font>

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,839
that is only true we should have what's

called a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one plus one restoral ring it</font>

340
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,020
which is common today I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we several</font>

341
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,030
seconds to have a sauna restoral we

342
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,040
believe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can achieve that in an IP</font>

343
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,140
network but the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is</font>

344
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,640
announcing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rubs that's what takes</font>

345
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,449
the time when you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a network</font>

346
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:59,360
linkage problem so we will we hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

347
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:01,730
use mpls we're just getting some beta

348
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,010
code now from our vendors and we want to

349
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,230
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to give us that fast restoral</font>

350
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,970
we also hope will give us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

351
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,550
do some traffic engineering and other

352
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,050
capabilities as well so with layers

353
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,880
stick with three restoral we've got a

354
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,829
lot more flexibility than the

355
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,810
traditional layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> one restoral</font>

356
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,180
capability it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more intelligent</font>

357
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,930
you know offer a hybrid mix of services

363
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,690
on traditional sauna networks and that's

364
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,550
the things you can give this a variety

365
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,130
of services and you can have diverse

366
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,780
restoral paths you don't have to go just

367
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,700
in the office of fiber you can wrote all

368
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,199
sorts of different directions so that's

369
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,220
part major part of our program which

370
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be implementing in the spring now</font>

371
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,120
one of the big areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's a</font>

372
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,310
significant advantages in the metro area

373
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,550
as I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> there several companies</font>

374
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:02,479
are developing Metro<font color="#CCCCCC"> WDM products Ozzie</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and this is a totally passive product or</font>

377
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,020
doesn't use any active components and

378
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,359
you have these optical add/drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> knox's</font>

379
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,370
so in a fiber ring up to about 100

380
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,000
kilometers<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up to right</font>

381
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:19,339
now 32 different wavelengths each one of

382
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,190
these wavelengths can work up to OC 48

383
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:25,400
speeds but the nice thing about it these

384
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:27,650

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,539
devices we want and if they can set up

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,250

434
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,599
that way so it allows a mixture of

435
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,149

with huge flows one direction to various

ISPs now ignoring some appearing issues

458

currently a nortel regen box for that

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,830
but there's new devices out both just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

485
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,960
little chip sets from a number of

<font color="#CCCCCC">companies that will replace the larger</font>

487
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,909

488
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:31,360
through the transponder into the WDM

00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,799
just it's like a prism no compactive

00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:41,320
components and then we go through up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

493
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,690
about 250<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilometers through a number of</font>

494
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,720

<font color="#CCCCCC">Caribbean doped amplifiers and they</font>

effects from the penguin type of fiber

500
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,480
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of other problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arise</font>

501
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,340
so you have to go back to electrical

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,830
level

503
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,959
clean up<font color="#E5E5E5"> your signals and so forth right</font>

504
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,659
now the only way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is used to</font>

505
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,400
use sonnet framing so we're currently

506
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,620
using sonic premium this<font color="#CCCCCC"> on long haul</font>

507
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,080
and then we go to the electrical level

508
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,790
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3r regeneration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> re clocking</font>

509
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,129
retiming reformatting and so forth and

510
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,670
then we go back into the optical domain

511
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:23,100
0 to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> far end to the router</font>

512
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,990
eventually we hope next year that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

513
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">use a less expensive type of</font>

that's results so far the network guys

significantly reduce the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost right now</font>

forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new 10x</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GBE which we</font>

think will be a lot more efficient and

614
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,480
so it gives us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of advantages but</font>

615
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,890
there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet over sonet that is</font>

618
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,610
but there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some issues as a mentioned</font>

somewhere else can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easily</font>

713
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:26,390
reconfigure that so that the sizes that

714
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're allocating can dynamically change</font>

715
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:30,020
was that something you have to fairly

716
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,450
manually do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right now it's</font>

717
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,310
worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> Emanuel a lot of this technology</font>

718
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">has to be pre-configured in the factory</font>

719
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,480
now you know you get a module you get

720
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,730
the card<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's set up and slap in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

721
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,070
module and you do it that way but it's

722
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,440
not dynamic at this point a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

723
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,030
researchers are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on optical cross</font>

years down the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

730
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,370
you may have three forward channels that

731
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:05,740
that's the granularity we talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

732
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:07,360
in the WDM world you have answered my

00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,740
question which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the heck are you</font>

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,389
going to get the traffic from to test

00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,570
out traffic engineering options and so

736
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,040
forth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard you say test sets I</font>

737
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,570
would assert that it's completely

00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,659
uninteresting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at anything other</font>

than heavily aggregated<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttp traffic and</font>

preferably my crow flies so the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

going to test traffic engineering in

743
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,130
such a way the people can judge whether

744
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,330
it's more useful than simply adding more

745
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,430
bandwidth here and there you know

746
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,800
parallels you 48 paths and then do

747
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:38,290
something like curtis's multipath stuff

748
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,990
for getting some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of load balancing</font>

points and points or whatever what's

750
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:47,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting is if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have your concept</font>

751
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,360
which is you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> to greater</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than half</font>

752
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,370

<font color="#E5E5E5">then doing a path collapse so that</font>

everything ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on one line and</font>

756
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,240
especially when you delay bandwidth

product is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> slice you want to see</font>

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,030
how everything sorts itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eric and</font>

759
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,460
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not any kind of sense of</font>

760
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:05,379
hearing or what have you had any use so

761
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,940
I would tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assert the tests</font>

762
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,110
themselves and so useful and what we

763
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,570
read more interesting is trying to

764
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,429
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out ways of getting end users of</font>

university<font color="#E5E5E5"> to are doing porn browsing</font>

767
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,340

768

can you know use dvc the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of</font>

00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth tested this a test set</font>

uninteresting I agree on over Santa at

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,220
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's only serve as initial</font>

776
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,960
testing for loading and so forth you got

777
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,490
to have real traffic and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to see</font>

778
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,140
what the band with the leg issues are

779
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,330
and so forth the other thing will be

780
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,160
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting is if you could work</font>

781
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,810
out some way to record the traffic in

782
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,020
any way shape<font color="#CCCCCC"> or form so that it could</font>

783
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:49,870
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> offline analysis fine record LC 48 is</font>

784
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,799
a challenge of course it is you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

785
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:55,268
the research money it seems and then

786
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay canary a canary seems to be turning</font>

787
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:58,539
into something other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allowed</font>

789
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:03,519
feathers so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get jokes about it</font>

790
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:05,169
yeah if there's some way so you actually

791
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,489
ship traffic to the likes of the people

792
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,709
at lvl and so forth that would be very

793
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:10,599
interested yeah we we work very closely

794
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:12,849
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet community in eng I and</font>

795
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:14,589
yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do those things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

796
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:16,239
problem canada i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we aggregated</font>

797
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:17,859
all our<font color="#E5E5E5"> university trapping for the one</font>

798
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:20,259

799
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:22,178
megabits sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:23,739
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> having some problem to as jenna 16</font>

801
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:25,719
just isn't interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus rather</font>

802
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:26,769
difficult to test because nobody has

803
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,809
enough traffic to fill any of these

804
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:32,139
things even with the TT having problems

805
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:34,059
with the SD cards and so forth but you

806
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:35,529
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you're the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

807
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,928
the transparency to actually talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

at the eyeballs so if you're able to

812
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:45,908
take advantage of the fact that you're

813

in a position to exploit your
