so good morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> my name is shondaland</font>

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently with Cisco Systems when</font>

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,769
hurricane katrina struck<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was still</font>

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:16,680
with SBC however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was asked that</font>

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,330
moderate this panel so one of our

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,420
presenters<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be here from</font>

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,299
bellsouth<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave so I just wanted to go</font>

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,500
over a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> days slides you have</font>

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,570
his full presentation online<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,149
but Dave mentioned some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,700
that bellsouth learned the last two

12
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,809
slides in the presentation are his

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:43,170
lessons learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bellsouth has a lot</font>

14
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,328
experience with hurricanes of all the

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,410
ilex in the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this was the</font>

16
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:51,899
first hurricane where they've actually

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:57,899
lost central offices in 100 plus years

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:01:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of hurricanes so even even my point</font>

19
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,359
there is regardless of how good you

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,158
think your disaster recovery is and how

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,460
strong you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build your central</font>

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,930
offices and and so forth if you get a

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">direct hit you're going to get a direct</font>

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people talk how they</font>

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,060
were infected<font color="#E5E5E5"> by something but quite</font>

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,240
often they weren't the ones who got the

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,220
direct hit and next<font color="#CCCCCC"> time they may be the</font>

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,350
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the direct it and it's more</font>

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:30,658
important how do you recover not whether

30
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">you got hits in the first place so some</font>

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,909
of the lessons bellsouth learned was

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,310
that bellsouth like most<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

33
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,229
providers we kind of know what our

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers are doing but we really don't</font>

35
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,270
know how our customers are using our

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,149
networks and are all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers</font>

37
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,658
use our networks for much much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

38
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,790
we ever imagined and although folks like

39
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the internet is is best</font>

40
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,860
effort unreliable people are using the

41
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,229
internet these days for very critical

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:07,350
services so the industry is psi<font color="#E5E5E5"> elects</font>

43
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,410
cable companies whatever communications

44
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,769
company you are you you are now<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of</font>

45
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,010
the first responder system

46
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:18,950
and any disaster if you don't have if if

47
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,530
there aren't communications rumors and

48
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,519
lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information and the fog of war</font>

49
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,920
so to speak makes any disaster you have

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,810
worse than if you had communications and

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information to the</font>

52
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,930
critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> first responders the other</font>

53
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:39,050
thing that bellsouth learned is that as

54
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,690
the the disaster progresses and lasts a

55
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,270
long time most most natural disasters

56
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,120
are pretty quick we've been fairly lucky

57
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:50,000
but as they<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue over several days</font>

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,750
and weeks providing security for

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,590
yourself becomes a more or more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

60
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,150
issue and often private private sector

61
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,590
has to provide their security for their

62
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,170
things because the public security

63
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,560
forces are quite frankly involved with

64
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:13,459
more important things dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,930
overall crisis and as industry the the

66
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,240
Katrina report is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out in</font>

67
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,390
Washington DC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's why some of our</font>

68
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,190
panelists<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be here today but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

69
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,320
is important<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand how</font>

70
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,910
government works in order to be

71
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,709
effective to work with government

72
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:32,720
although I'm sure that all levels of

73
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,300
government are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be receiving</font>

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">some well-deserved bashing today in that</font>

75
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,200
report in<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality it's our government</font>

76
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,299
and it's what we make of it and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work how government</font>

78
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,300
works and how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can work with the way</font>

79
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,470
they work to be effective they have

80
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,480
their priorities you have your

81
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,480
priorities<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to make them alive</font>

82
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,429
so some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that bellsouth</font>

83
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,700
learned is that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> already had a lot</font>

84
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,890
of partnerships with state other

85
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,820
carriers state officials federal

86
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:13,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">officials but they also needed to reach</font>

87
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,250
out with other groups both within the

88
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,620
industry and across industries such as

89
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,149
power companies because the power

90
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,800
industry in the telecommunications

91
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:26,599
industry are very intertwined and you

92
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,790
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,150
on the fly you need to establish those

94
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:35,720
relationships ahead of time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

95
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,729
the the federal links are up there the

96
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,220
communications<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sack in the national</font>

98
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:49,190
Katrina the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FCC also had their national</font>

99
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:52,030
phone number<font color="#E5E5E5"> available 24 by 7 and they</font>

100
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:56,240
were responding<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emergency requests</font>

101
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:58,669
for coordination also and last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

102
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,280
there are a number of federal programs

103
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,170
although people think that things like

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,130
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government emergency</font>

105

<font color="#CCCCCC">telecommunication service priority and</font>

their wireless priority system gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> TSP</font>

108
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,190
WPS those are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for government</font>

109
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:20,090
folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though ISPs are quote</font>

110
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:22,610
unregulated ISPs can also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in</font>

111
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,640
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those programs so if you believe</font>

112
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,670
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some critical customers as</font>

113
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,590
an ISP even if you aren't a phone

company or one of the other companies

115
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">you should look into those programs and</font>

116
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:41,659
all those programs are available on the

<font color="#CCCCCC">ww NCS gov website so next I'm going to</font>

118
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:55,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask Bobby Cates from NASA to give a few</font>

119
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:58,910
words on his experience actually mines

120
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:01,070
pretty short start with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> success is</font>

121
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that just to get a few networks to</font>

122
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:07,070
cooperate you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get a lot done</font>

123
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:11,150
we supported<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very first emergency</font>

124
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:14,450
responders that flew in<font color="#E5E5E5"> after Katrina we</font>

125
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:17,599
had network access from disaster

126
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:20,630
recovery web services we've been

127
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,240
screamed video we provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a monday</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">night football video coverage every</font>

129
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">monday night i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool that</font>

130
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,800
stuff actually worked real well we had

131
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,060
all the typical government facilities

132
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,370
out there as well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> satphones and such</font>

133
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,660
and those worked well but we actually

134
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a chance to have them side by side</font>

135
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,040
and the same

136
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:45,770
tents and the commercial facilities were

137
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,700
actually preferable the quality on the

138
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:53,299
voice over IP was better late in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

139
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,190
disaster<font color="#E5E5E5"> the president flew in Secret</font>

140
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Service entourage actually took over the</font>

141
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,270
whole spectrum<font color="#E5E5E5"> space for the satellite</font>

142
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,280
phones so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the military come in</font>

143
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:06,530
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> using our commercial voiceover IP</font>

144
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:09,799
phones the bill for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the voice over</font>

145
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,719
IP phones<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty-some-odd together was</font>

146
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,420
less than just one satellite phone so

147
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,710
it's there's no comparison for quality

148
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">of service or efficiency I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

149
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,909
that those phones actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just we got</font>

150
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
those on a few hours notice from people

151
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,290
like Bill Woodcock a packet

152
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Clearinghouse we got most of service on</font>

153
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,880
like an hour's notice from different

154
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,880
providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a Bay Area IP networks and</font>

155
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,560
others so it wasn't some long

156
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,080
established system that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just flipped</font>

157
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,880
a switch and turn on it was basically

158
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,609
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving up to Berkeley and</font>

159
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,110
making calls on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and kind</font>

160
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of got things up while there was a c5</font>

161
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,960
warming up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a runway and we got it</font>

162
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,660
loaded before it left the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

163
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,020
that every disaster is kind of different

164
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,190
it's really tough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pre-plan everything</font>

165
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,190
there's limitations at least for the

166
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,230
first responders going in typically

167
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,610
they're going in like Huey and your

168
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,200
cherry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whatever the payload master</font>

169
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,580
says you're carrying in on that load<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

170
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,260
you don't know when that the next

171
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,909
delivery is going to be so I mean you

172
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,740
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a whole data center built up</font>

173
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:16,700
and back up and delivering it's a

174
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:19,370
different story TSP was kind of

175
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,920
interesting for Katrina again I imagine

176
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:26,690
every disaster is different but at least

177
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:30,110
for the higher bandwidth higher price

178
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:32,480
circuits the OC 12s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and OC 3 s we didn't</font>

179
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,750
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between the TSP</font>

180
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,730
listed recovery and<font color="#CCCCCC"> anant ESP listed I</font>

181
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,549
imagined something more ubiquitous like

182
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:42,740
a t1 is probably a longer lag time for

183
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,290
restoral but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have data on that</font>

184
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,700
and then the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things or what</font>

185
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,089
people have talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about already things</font>

186
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,189
like a wimax and<font color="#CCCCCC"> voip just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I would really save the day and they're</font>

189
00:08:54,999 --> 00:09:01,180
pretty confident we'll see more of that

190
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,180
in the future and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really ugly guy</font>

saffir-simpson schedule is or scales

201

people actually understand what

202
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:33,769
hurricanes are a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

by a 5 hurricane last year or the year

207

before there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only been three cat five</font>

hurricanes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last hundred years</font>

209
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:46,370
that have hit the continental United

212
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:54,649
miami hurricane in 1935 so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

213
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:56,660
dramatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of all the storms in last</font>

214
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:59,029
hundred years 131 of them have hit

215
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,800
Florida so we're just you know my house

216
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:01,790
is covered with screws all over for

217
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,559
steel shutters and all the other good

218
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,809
stuff that goes along with that and we

219
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:07,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">just live eat and breathe hurricanes and</font>

220
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:09,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a garage filled with water and</font>

221
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,389
supplies and canned food and just normal

222
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,518
every season you have that lots of

223
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:15,290
batteries and radios and all that good

224
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,459
stuff and it's really fun entertaining

225
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,459
your kids without TV for a week

226
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,529

leave it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> donlon to create a disaster</font>

228
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so so saffir-simpson schedule</font>

229
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,710
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> your scale basically talks</font>

230
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,130
about the different ranges of hurricanes

231
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:19,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can come through cat 13 cat5 cat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

232
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,780
is 74 to 95 miles an hour the important

233
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,880
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> wind in water and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 foot</font>

234
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,620
storm surge usually you see that just

235
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,880
right on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beach no big deal if i live</font>

236
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,500
in florida i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even put up hurricane</font>

237
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,820
shutters we kind of blow it off you hope

238
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,020
her window doesn't break um that was

<font color="#CCCCCC">Shawn's inserted slide there you go so</font>

240
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,460
cat 2 is 96 to 110 you starting a little

241
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">more worried I don't I live a mile from</font>

242
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,250
the beach so as my house I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font>

243
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">worry about it maybe the beach people</font>

244
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,580
have to start kind of evacuating they

245
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,099
issue mandatory evacuations the<font color="#E5E5E5"> National</font>

246
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Guard goes around all that fun stuff</font>

247
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,250
cat3 we start to really get nervous we

248
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,050
start flying our kids out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of town</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

249
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,760
they're driving away and there's huge

250
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,500
lines of traffic and that's actually

251
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">what hit us in Florida this year with</font>

252
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,640
Wilma Katrina hit this is a one the year

253
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,220
before that we have by three different

254
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,370
hurricanes a cat<font color="#CCCCCC"> 23 range so pretty</font>

255
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,170
dramatic mobile homes are gone you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

256
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,610
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more damage a lot more storm surge</font>

257
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,770
it starts washing over the buildings on

258
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,890
the beach and it gets pretty ugly I'm

259
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:16,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">cat for which is what hit as Katrina in</font>

260
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:18,720
Louisiana it hit us as a one was a lot

261
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,490
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage 13 18 foot title search now</font>

262
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,440
the reason it was so bad in the storm

263
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,090
surge in Louisiana it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cat5 right</font>

264
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,280
off the coast right before it hit land

265
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,140
so the surge had already built up so the

266
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,720
surge was actually a cat<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 plus surge</font>

267
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,880
massive but it actually winds are

268
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,770
actually only cat 4 so you can actually

269
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,400
understand that win level now he gets

270
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:40,500
cat 5 100 55 mile an hour or greater now

Yucatan was almost 190 miles an hour

277
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,939
it's the lowest barometric pressure ever

278
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,890
recorded in history pretty scary just

279
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,510
damage everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18 foot plus tidal</font>

surges you heard there's 50 foot numbers

281
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,560
um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that that stuff does happen</font>

282
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you have hundreds of tornadoes</font>

283
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,979
inside that storm not just the wind and

284
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,320
storm surge with the tornadoes to start

285

how really lame last year was you had

288
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,080
over 30 storms in total 27 named storms

289
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,690
it's really interesting to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

290
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,889
tropical depressions which usually form

291
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,179
up and they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> her out</font>

292
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:22,859
really worries about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wind</font>

293
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,749
and rain but to actually have 27 named

294
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:26,879
storms<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hitting all over the place and</font>

295
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:28,920
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a lot of those hit into the</font>

296
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:33,119
Gulf and a lot of a lot of warm water

297
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,979
this year so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually this actually</font>

298
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:36,449
shows Katrina's track and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

299
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,609
Katrina formed right<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the Bahamas</font>

300
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:40,019
it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a little problem we have in</font>

301
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,459
Florida in this time of year when

302
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,410
Katrina actually form they form right

303
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,779
off the Bahamas<font color="#CCCCCC"> and instantly hit us so</font>

304
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,069
you pretty much drive home from work get

305
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,569
out your shutters hang your shutters an

306
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,219
hour button everything up try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

307
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:52,679
all the furniture turned over tied up or

308
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,790
stored at home for example and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you run</font>

309
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,769
into the house and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hurricane hits</font>

310
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,929
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours later so it's it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really fast</font>

311
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,309
when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes in this way so that's how</font>

312
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:00,569
we had to deal with in South Florida and

313
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:02,040
the problem we had is nobody was really

314
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:04,498
ready in everybody blew it off as a one

315
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,819
but it happened to just knock down a lot

316
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:07,559
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trees the winds were pretty intense</font>

317
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:09,748
<font color="#CCCCCC">we had a lot of war texts and it took</font>

318
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,429
down you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of power lines so</font>

319
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:13,949
hence we had a lot a long amount of

320
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:16,199
outage but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see as it tracked up</font>

321
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:17,368
the really darker colors was a cat5<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

322
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:19,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gulf and that just built up the</font>

323
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:20,939
waves in the surge and it pushed that

324
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:25,110
water<font color="#E5E5E5"> into Louisiana even though hit is</font>

325
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:26,759
a cat for when it got in there um this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

326
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,869
gots to animation this is so exciting it

327
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:32,579
took<font color="#CCCCCC"> me two hours to figure how to put</font>

328
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:34,649
this into a powerpoint uh-huh so this is

329
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually Wilma going over and right</font>

330
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,259
where the eye goes over is my house I'm

331
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:40,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to whine about that for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

332
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,910
while here I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky enough to be an</font>

333
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,410
analog in Los Angeles when this was

334
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,309
hitting but I was watching this on radar

335
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,449
I was running around showing everybody

336
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:49,730
and freaking out<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to get a</font>

337
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:51,660
flight home yeah I I had I had to have a

338
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,189
shutters up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my house actually before</font>

339
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,629
I left so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky enough that I done</font>

340
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:56,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i saw this storm coming it</font>

341
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:59,069
was so big it was just kind of worried

342
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,899
my wife and kids were out of town but

343
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:03,329
devastating damages to my own home now

344
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,739
we take it back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nap we had to</font>

345
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:05,729
face a lot of issues we face power

346
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,839
issues and everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

347
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,029
hurricane perspective we're designed

348
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,519
around this this is only a cat<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 storm</font>

349
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,629
and if you notice the southern County

350
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,399
where you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little radar scatter</font>

351
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:16,259
that's miami-dade county but look how

352
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,149
far look how far north the storm was and

353
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,149
radar goes over<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see the I</font>

354
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,739
going up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and broward and palm beach</font>

355
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:24,779
county broward county probably get the

356
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:26,850
worst of it miami-dade had huge damage

357
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,169
cos down everywhere all those fiber

358
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,249
paths run north on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the east</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and west</font>

359
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,289
coast so it hit it from both sides

360
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:32,670
covers the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> state I mean there's</font>

361
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:40,990
no escaping it you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in</font>

362
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:43,870
um was that cool animation by the way I

363
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:47,620
will sell you the the rights of how to

364
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,760
do that now so as I said we had 27 named

365
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,070
storms we actually went into the Greek

366
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,170
alphabet we even had a Greek name storm

367
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,520
over new years new years<font color="#CCCCCC"> forming in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

368
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,250
Atlantic and actually was it went up and

369
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,800
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it caused issues of Spain it hit</font>

370
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,200
like what had a really strange track as

371
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,150
I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> no cat five storms came in it was</font>

372
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,920
cat for when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hit louisiana and</font>

373
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,860
mississippi and katrina and<font color="#E5E5E5"> katherine we</font>

374
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,449
when woman hit Florida and and again

375
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,400
Wilma had the lowest barometric pressure

376
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,600
ever recorded in history let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope to</font>

377
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">god it doesn't happen again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in another</font>

378
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,690
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's hope it doesn't sit over</font>

379
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,610
us like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did over the Yucatan if that</font>

380
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">hits it's over an area for two days in</font>

381
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,150
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of infrastructure we have is</font>

382
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,190
united states in a Florida Louisiana or

383
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,930
texas area I mean untold billions of

384
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:31,450
damages and I'm sure phim will respond

385
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:32,910
at least two weeks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so everybody</font>

386
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,070
knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Tara mark has big balls right</font>

387
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:42,910
what now kids I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

388
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:44,589
this isn't the weather channel so at

389
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">Noda we had we did have some damage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

390
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:49,000
talk of my balls<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'll talk</font>

391
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">about packets what r and you'll like so</font>

392
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,660
we have the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest issue we face</font>

393
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,010
noda we have we're supposed to withstand

394
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,510
toward a mile an hour wind loads on her

395
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,830
on our curtain walls the way the

396
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,150
buildings constructed in the roof<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

397
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">the domes are actually supposed to</font>

398
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,439
withstand 250 mile an hour winds now

399
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,329
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said cap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five is 100 and 150</font>

400
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,920
five strongest every record in history's

401
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,448
190 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able go</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of it but I have a wonderful little</font>

404
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,110
circle we actually lost this ball I was

405
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:16,420
a half-a-million-dollar ball during this

406
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:18,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">time frame we actually had a power</font>

407
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,199
outage going to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide actually</font>

408
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,990
talking about power and how this

409
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,819
affected packets and and and issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

410
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,280
people now the nap itself never<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

411
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:29,440
lost genset power went on commercial

412
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,330
power during Katrina we were out for 31

413
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,650
hours we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just running on generators</font>

414
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,178
the commercial grade was dirty there

415
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,830
were lines down everywhere fpl was

416
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,860
totally unprepared and did not expect

417
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this at all a lot of CEOs went down all</font>

418
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,740
the cell towers went down you couldn't

419

make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a phone call after two days click</font>

420
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,790
people couldn't refuel there was no way

421
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,179
to get connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thankfully my dial</font>

422
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,619
up

423
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:51,039
worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the only way is able to get</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">into anything when it actually came</font>

425
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,908
through Wilma we actually got back off

426
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,259
the commercial grid and onto the

427
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:58,330
commercial grid in 10 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it was</font>

428
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:59,559
so dirty and so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> big spikes and</font>

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,158
that now what got what was really really

442
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,629
the issues we had to face inside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nap</font>

443
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,210
were actually truckloads of servers

444
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:33,158
coming in everybody was<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of business</font>

445
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,990
spammers hosting guys enterprises

446
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,369
government guys showing up with servers

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,080
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back door banging on the back</font>

448
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:39,309
door security not one of letting men

449
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,129
were in lockdown right post-hurricane

450
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:43,720
you know heavy security we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

451
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:45,639
a sales guy their handwriting contracts

452
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,009
and engineers upstairs installing all

453
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:49,899
the racks and cages for people bringing

454
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:51,399
up power getting connectivity getting

455
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:53,709
cross connects getting carriers to give

456
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:55,658
us responses to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> loa cfa and all the</font>

457
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,220
stuff to turn these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people up any ISP to</font>

458
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:59,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw cable over to get people turned up</font>

459
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,580
so it would actually signed over 40

460
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,019
companies to get them in there on

461
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,070
emergency operations we gave them an out

462
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,740
so they could actually leave if they

463
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,570
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and some did but it was</font>

464
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,999
definitely keeping all those businesses

465
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,559
alive was the big issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only know of</font>

466
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:14,289
oh yeah let me talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fuel by</font>

467
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,279

00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:16,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I started receiving phone calls</font>

469
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,879
roundish all the undersea cable

470
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:21,249
operators literally begging for fuel

471
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:22,959
begging these guys only had two to three

472
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:24,159
days of fuel now an undersea cable think

473
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,379
about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you take an</font>

you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at all the industry</font>

477
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:32,860
cable come in there we have 12 undersea

478
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:34,269
cables in<font color="#CCCCCC"> South Florida you take out all</font>

479
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,399
those things they start losing fuel you

480
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:37,690
cut off South America so it was it was a

481
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,799
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together saying</font>

fuel I'll send it to you there was there

485
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,220
was a big network of things we had the

486
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,389
association of contingency planners all

487
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,740
calling each other's a little circuit of

488
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,059
people and we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

489
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">get fuel back and forth to keep these</font>

490
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:53,470
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so South America could stay</font>

491
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,210
alive so all the operations keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

492
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,859
only know<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one carrier they actually</font>

493
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,530
fully lost a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CEO</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to name</font>

494
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:00,149
them but they lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up in North Miami</font>

495
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,680
it was a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> some postings around and</font>

496
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,750

501
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,350
of that so so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> caused it caused the</font>

were you seen lots of traffic from

569
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:32,919
places that you had a plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> for or was</font>

570
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:34,809
the business as<font color="#CCCCCC"> usual yeah so the</font>

574
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:47,770
more than just those facilities we

supported NCS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> FEMA and DOD and</font>

576
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:55,540
basically anybody that was there and it

577
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,740
kind of brings up a question one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

578
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,530
things that I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

579
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,690
future we had a que you banned satellite

00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,010
link back and depending on what the

581
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">demands are we can go up to a full</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point that everyone's plugged in</font>

584
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,870
directly into the satellite modems and

585
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,910
there's kind of no qos so everybody just

586
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,090
you know has to be kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good</font>

587
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:20,020
neighbors to each other so that being

588
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,520
said NASA was actually you know we were

589
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:26,440
using less traffic on a satellite<font color="#CCCCCC"> link</font>

590
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,090
been many of the other folks and really

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the biggest bandwidth hog was the</font>

don't have any issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> Phil Norton I</font>

596
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,750
guess the first question was to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh was</font>

597
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:51,400
there any impact by the loss of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:53,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">you balls or were these redundant and</font>

599
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,210
this was just an additional ones he lost

600
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:59,890
one level of redundancy as you know i

601
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:01,600
did have three balls and that that ball

602
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,179
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a little different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the two</font>

603
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,100
big ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 16</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meters RCB and dishes</font>

604
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,510
and the domes are huge they're like

605
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,290
eight stories high picture doesn't

606
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:13,090
really do it justice what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

607
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,290
did and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think ken is one of our guys</font>

608
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,908
actually the room he's actually up there

609
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">when the her</font>

610
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:18,090
was hitting he was on hurricane duty and

611
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,249
is actually into the small dome which is

612
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,539
aku<font color="#E5E5E5"> van dome while it's falling apart</font>

613
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:23,940
around him trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it up to</font>

614
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,830
azimuth so that you know the dishes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

615
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,809
could actually survive as 11 meter cube

616
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,210
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dish what happened is there's some</font>

617
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:31,349
thinner panels on that dome so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> K you</font>

618
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,389
say get through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little bit</font>

619
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:35,759
different than the sea signal and one of

620
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,408
those either<font color="#CCCCCC"> got penetrated or ruptured</font>

621
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,970
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire thing just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

622
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,759
like a buckyball because the structure

623
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,149
collapsed in on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> can so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ball</font>

624
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,249
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a protective surrounding</font>

625
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:48,809
that the dish exactly the dish is fully

626
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,859
mobile inside so they got up to 90

627
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:51,749
degrees<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's interesting though is</font>

628
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:53,279
that the dish actually got bashed around

629
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:55,019
by the foam and debris hitting it it's

630
00:24:53,279 --> 00:25:01,139
got a little some peeled up corners it

631
00:24:55,019 --> 00:25:03,779
performs better now so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess the real</font>

632
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:05,340
thing that I was hoping to hear from you

633
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:08,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys and maybe you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can elaborate a</font>

634
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:12,178
little bit on this is what are the

635
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,340
lessons learned what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to do</font>

636
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:22,979
better next time as a result of what we

637
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:24,599
learned from these disasters I think one

638
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,009
lesson learned is the rule of thumb

639
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,229
previously had been that you could have

640
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:30,859
a backup site within or or let's say 100

641
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:34,470
miles are further and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think with the</font>

642
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:36,418
250-mile swath of various multiple

643
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,830
hurricanes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearly need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

644
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,570
backup center that's further away in

645
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,580
more inland because a lot of firms I

646
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,168
talked with head back up centers in

647
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,289
houston and then Houston had to evacuate

648
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:47,940
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rita so it was kind of that domino</font>

649
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:53,639
effect all over again that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dish it's one</font>

650
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:55,559
observation<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually our lesson learn</font>

651
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:56,969
was more on the good side we actually

652
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:00,210
accomplished more than we had

653
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:03,239
anticipated and most of that's just

654
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">knowing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people like y'all so I mean</font>

655
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:06,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's what we're doing is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we</font>

656
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:09,599
meet people at beer and beer or whatever

657
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:13,619
we kind of find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out who's willing to</font>

658
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:15,049
volunteer services or support and how we

659
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:17,570
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> incorporate them into the neck</font>

660
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:22,070
then we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking more than we have</font>

661
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:24,619
in the past heart ours really had to do

662
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:28,309
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people we have you know we host the</font>

663
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:29,360
911 systems and DOD and the county

664
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:30,889
government the police department all the

665
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,600
steps in there today we worked really

666
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,830
well with them and communicating and be

667
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,168
able to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> them staff and allowing</font>

668
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,809
those people in global crossing actually

669
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:40,070
lost their their offices so they had to

670
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:41,269
pop in our building they moved all their

671
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,158
staff and was just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

672
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:44,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">helping our biggest thing is staff</font>

673
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,570
though making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that our staff has</font>

674
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:49,249
communications food water who needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

675
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,779
you know if every somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else didn't</font>

676
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:51,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">have damage to the house you know go up</font>

677
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:53,299
help these people clean up their yard

678
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,700
and all the trees get the shutters down

679
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:56,779
you know get their families in order and

680
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,899
all that stuff it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> your people</font>

681
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:01,369
the most important thing I guess I was

682
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:04,549
just thinking more along the lines of

683
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:07,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet infrastructure I mean I</font>

684
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:08,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first talk to verizon</font>

685
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,719
talk about this intricate web of

686
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,459
dependencies and certainly if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you run</font>

687
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,950
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of power you can't run the central</font>

688
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,629

689
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular problem what next</font>

690
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:20,899
is on the brake horizon what's going to

691
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:22,700
break next that will prevent the

692
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:24,529
internet from functioning properly or

693
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,450
make it more difficult to recover once

694
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:27,830
it does break and I remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

695
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,600
picture of the bridge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was sliced</font>

696
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,158
into a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different pieces you</font>

697
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,320
can't get fire trucks across them but

698
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:35,539
also more importantly to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

699
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,070
crowd is you have a lot of fiber that

700
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:39,200
goes across those bridges that is now

701
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,970
splintered in 30 different places and

702
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,489
you need to run new fiber across those

703
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:46,399
bridges to get things back up so those

704
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:47,359
types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet focused lessons</font>

705
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:52,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">learned is what I was kind of looking</font>

706
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:56,239
for so my comment on that is is the the

707
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:58,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet design is of course a semi mash</font>

708
00:27:56,239 --> 00:28:01,789
not a full match and you have the bridge

709
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:03,289
outage and there were eyes peas in in

710

New<font color="#CCCCCC"> Orleans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that did manage to stay up</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano glist you saw some of those</font>

713
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:12,649
postings and there were multiple ways

714
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,199
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of New Orleans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and not all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

715
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:17,209
them were disrupted throughout

716
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:21,350
throughout the incident so the internet

717
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:25,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">lesson is IP can re-route but you got to</font>

718
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:26,810
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it something to rear out over so</font>

Chris

720
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:31,830
so I had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hopes with the with</font>

721
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the presentation and that panel one was</font>

722
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that some more disaster recovery stuff</font>

723
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:39,150
would kind of be covered I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

724
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting question might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be for the</font>

00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">panel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> folks is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe Paula answer</font>

726
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,850
some of this as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

727
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,679
organizations that have disaster

728
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,590
recovery plans that include like I lost

729
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">my hard drive i lost my central server</font>

730
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:54,120
how is the change when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say i lost my</font>

731
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,790
whole office you know my staff can go

732
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,780
remote in work but i have no office them

733
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:02,280
to get to the telecom providers have

734
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,110
services for them for disaster recovery

735
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,450
sort of you know remote access solutions

736
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:10,469
things like that were those used in to

737
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,790
any great effect here and for the

738
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,250
telecom providers themselves that

739
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:17,190
actually have pops local<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> admit</font>

740
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:19,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I didn't ask anything that happened</font>

741
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:24,180
beyond the first day with our hub down

742
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:26,790
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know were you able to keep</font>

743
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">was mostly able to keep all of the</font>

00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet infrastructure up and running i</font>

745
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,500
think is sort of bills question and

746
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">john's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> respond so but I heard about six</font>

747
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,550
questions let me answer the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

748
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:41,940
remember one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions was I</font>

749
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:44,399
guess you know as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier maybe what</font>

750
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,400
did verizon or MC I do to help out maybe

751
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,710
I misheard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but we have a solution</font>

752
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,800
called private IP which is our mpls

753
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:55,650
solution typically you know you may have

754
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,210
frame relay or private line access but

755
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:01,590
we do have an alternate that sold for

756
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:03,300
backup involving<font color="#E5E5E5"> vsat access and so</font>

757
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,490
whether customers had prepaid for that

758
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,100
or now wanted that we did have<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

759
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">five very large firms in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> louisiana that</font>

760
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">called and on an emergency priority</font>

761
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,500
basis we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them</font>

762
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:16,290
satellite access so they could keep

763
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,120
their IP networks running<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think</font>

764
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:21,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have permission to say who those firms</font>

765
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:25,080
were but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite large MC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i also</font>

766
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:27,000
had like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they call it the blue truck and</font>

767
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,010
maybe it's now the verizon red truck and

768
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,140
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure but anyway so it's</font>

769
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:34,230
basically an empty truck with a bunch of

770
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">pcs it rolls in and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FEMA or some</font>

771
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,820
government entity rented or reserved

772
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,420
three of those and I'm sure if we'd had

773
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,820
30 they

774
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,360
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken them all so that's some</font>

775
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,290
contribution that we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

776
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll let someone get some of the other</font>

777
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions we an interesting thing that</font>

778
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,660
happened is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Katrina hit and you know as</font>

779
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,669
much air earlier in the year and all

780
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,020
that all the dr trial trailers for HP

781
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,730
and IBM there they actually bring in

782
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,840
these mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> workgroup recovery units</font>

783
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,120
they call it or they recover the people

784
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,980
they were all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> new orleans and you</font>

785
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,120
know all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place so here we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

786
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,830
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> in South Florida after a woman</font>

787
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,659
there's no trailers left and there's no

788
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,730
mobile switches nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> left to bring</font>

789
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">down there so it was a it was a it was a</font>

790
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,960
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of catastrophe from that perspective</font>

791
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:14,399
so it proves that because he could have

792
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,440
so many hurricanes in a single season

793
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,880
you need multiple backups which you know

794
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,310
mobile switch trucks backup worker

795
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,690
recovery trucks everything else I what

796
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,950
we saw in South Florida is that you know

797
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,870
everybody was shell-shocked after the

798
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,340
hurricane hit after wilma hit and nobody

799
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,899
expected it to be so big and everybody

800
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,790
kind of wander around like you know you

801
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,370
know lost for about three days and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

802
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,480
finally pots lines<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i just i got</font>

803
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,040
to emphasize how important is to have

804
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,870
pots line it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have your</font>

805
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,520
broadband connection but if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font>

806
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:41,610
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cable head int IP head</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ends gone</font>

807
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:45,570
or their gown pots lines are great

808
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:47,939
really it's incredible<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok one last</font>

809
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,550
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we'll head out to break</font>

810
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,380
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i did a question I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

811
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:54,320
more for a verizon but you know the

812
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,150
others<font color="#E5E5E5"> can feel free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer as well</font>

813
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,770
call me the optimist but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look at</font>

814
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:03,330
situations like this as an opportunity

815
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:04,470
to because the the damage<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so vast you</font>

816
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:07,370
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity to sort of</font>

817
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:11,610
re-evaluate how you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and</font>

818
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:13,469
perhaps look at what you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

819
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,760
was legacy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want to do any</font>

820
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:18,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">more that you can kind of use this as an</font>

821
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,070
opportunity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be shed up and put in new</font>

822
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,230
gear new access types things like moving

823
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,669
from copper to fiber for example that's

824
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">already sort of an objective of</font>

00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:28,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">verizon's I think can you kind of talk</font>

826
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,199
to what-what discussion has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

827
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,880
on around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no let me be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear that</font>

828
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,280
verizon of course is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the local</font>

829
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,110
exchange provider in pretty much any of

830
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">these three hurricane areas so that</font>

831
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:42,659
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be unfortunately heavily hitting</font>

832

bell south tampa<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay tampa example you</font>

833
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,980
guys you would know by woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i</font>

834
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,750
would say you know my observation and

835
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,500
maybe i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know the spokesperson</font>

836
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,530
on this is

837
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,870
that you have a huge capital plant

838
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:56,940
infrastructure so even though parts of

839
00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:00,300
it are destroyed it's an economic

840
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision of you know to the point of we</font>

841
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,750
want to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> people their dial tone back</font>

842
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,330
on an emergency basis and they were

843
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:08,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally stringing you know wire or you</font>

844
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,620
know cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> across trees and across front</font>

845
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,510
porches on a temporary basis which I

846
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,040
would feel sure if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went back and</font>

847
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">looked they probably are still sitting</font>

848
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">there across trees and front porches but</font>

849
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:21,240
so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision of do we</font>

850
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,710
upgrade and what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> that take and</font>

851
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">what kind of capital I would sure like</font>
