maintain a sign zone there are some we

62
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:23,410
hope very detailed documents about how

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,780
you step-by-step guides for signing and

64

maintaining a sign zone interactions

65

between the parent zone and the child's

66
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,590
own and on there they're also the usual

67

<font color="#CCCCCC">sourceforge mailing lists provided and</font>

68

this is on<font color="#E5E5E5"> sourceforge the DNS SEC tools</font>

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

74
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,720
infrastructure I've been kind of nagging

75
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:05,280
about this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's an</font>

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,720
important problem everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows it's</font>

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,640
an important<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem there have been a</font>

78
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,560
multitude of different suggested

79
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,359
solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> none of them have particularly</font>

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,120
gotten any any traction so there have

81
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:23,250
been three workshops held in the last

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,650
year inviting the interested parties the

83
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,470
intent is to find an acceptable and

84
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,039
deployable solution get the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

85
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,440
would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be doing that</font>

86
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,220
working on it get something going to

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,889
move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get security at least</font>

88
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,560
started we had service providers access

89
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,600
providers content providers vendors the

90
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,280
security research community the routing

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,460
research community DNA DHS was the host

92
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,309
and the facilitator they are not

93
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:58,680
themselves making any suggestions as to

94
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,360
what the solution would be and that's

95
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,400
the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you can go look at the</font>

96
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,010
presentations and minutes from all that

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,229
from those meetings now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

98
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,300
meetings I think I've said in a couple

99
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,789
other places that the strongest<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

100
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,030
the thing through all meetings was it

101
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:17,039
sure would be helpful to have an

102
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,409
authenticated list of authorized prefix

103
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,550
originator 'he's which a SS are

104
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,530
authorized to announce your prefix and

105
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,260
the intent<font color="#CCCCCC"> dist use it in in however</font>

106
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">many ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be using such a</font>

107
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,539
thing in responding to customers

108
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,010
requests to router prefix in

109
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:36,659
troubleshooting routing problems exactly

110
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,590
who is supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be announcing that</font>

111
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,020
prefix in constructing your filters if

112
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,630
you want to be constructing filters but

113
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,789
this is also the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> step in any of</font>

114
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,550
the suggested solutions for protecting

115
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:55,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp it's the first step that has to be</font>

116
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,710
done so out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last workshop arose a</font>

117
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:01,480
suggestion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aaron's should begin</font>

118
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:04,549
to collect in all the number templates

119
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:09,620
allocation and sub allocation and

120
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:12,920
assignment ins and such should begin to

121
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,470
have a new field that we collect a list

122
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:20,330
of the a SS allowed to announce that

123
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:22,790
prefix the intended benefit is this is a

124
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,169
procedure that the operators are used to

125
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">there they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used to filling out the</font>

126
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,300
templates they know they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fill</font>

127
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:33,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">out the templates for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin in order to</font>

128
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:36,290
do new allocations<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRR entries are in</font>

129
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,990
the back of everybody's mind perhaps but

130
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,390
they aren't always done hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

131
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,070
field in the template as you're filling

132
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,750
it out for another purpose you'll there

133
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,230
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more motivation to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and</font>

134
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,870
put it in there but it also inherits the

135
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:54,440
scrutiny that Erin does on initial

136
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,690
allocations and on any authentication

137
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,080
that they have with<font color="#CCCCCC"> their with the</font>

138
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,070
members to ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prefect the</font>

139
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,729
requests are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the correct</font>

140
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:07,730
people furthermore Erin is the authority

141
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:10,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">for who is allocated what prefixes so</font>

142
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,400
they are the ones that have what you

143
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have to refer to in creating any</font>

144
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:23,750
route object anyway so speaking of

145
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:27,860
authentication I are ours that are run

146
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:30,530
