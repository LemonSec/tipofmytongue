is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> group of people to think especially</font>

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,280
but that party was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing wasn't</font>

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,550
it that to me was a real community

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,200
builder and it was Brokaw's brainchild<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

38
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:31,290
hope you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the chance to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meet Brokaw</font>

40
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,739
as r n provo who<font color="#CCCCCC"> was up earlier this</font>

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,390
morning moderating pointed out to me his

42
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,520
idea was to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people mingling who</font>

43
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,709
ordinarily don't mingle and the gambling

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,980
was obviously the right place for that

45
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:53,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not to mention the bowl here are</font>

51
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,750
only six percent and here you see

52
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,920
various communities represented these

53
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,370
are real numbers in other words people
