153
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:24,889
sunday or saturday night but I think

154
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,349
that's on the fix we've got some big

155
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,629
high-rise apartments coming into

156
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:32,270
downtown Dallas and looks like the Ritz

00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:42,619
changing one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need</font>

when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you host a nanog is a big fat</font>

162
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think house in years</font>

163
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,308
gone by have have found a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

164
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:57,979
challenge when we started talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

165
00:07:55,309 --> 00:08:01,789
folks here at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fairmont you know</font>

166
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:03,289
obviously ballroom size is important but

167
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:05,119
also that internet connection is

168
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:07,279
important as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were pretty</font>

169
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">pleased that they had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 ones they</font>

170
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,509
actually had two and another pair was

171
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:15,169
going to be delivered a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit later</font>

172
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:16,909
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were they were installing</font>

173
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,279
the second pair<font color="#CCCCCC"> of T ones when we were</font>

174
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:22,459
pulling the fiber for this this event so

175
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:26,569
we kind of said wow I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

176
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:28,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's gonna quite do it and we got</font>

177
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:31,219
that result but I'll get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

178
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:32,568
little bit later the<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminal room is</font>

179
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,880
something that we had to deliver on as

180
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:37,039
well as house I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody has seen</font>

181
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,078
the virtual terminal terminal room that

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,519
the security folks here at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fairmont</font>

192
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,189
said it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not a real good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

193

200
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,970
real experience for me and proud I feel

201
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:29,149
like I've been submerged in the garment

202
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,710
business working<font color="#E5E5E5"> through t-shirt</font>

purple and you know yellow is not good

207

you can use purple or black and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

216
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,500
sufficiently geeky so thank you Mike

217
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:10,460

223
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,860
it's it's probably one of the better

224
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,990
Texas barbecues you'll have so

225
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,830
throughout this whole process of putting

226
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:33,350
together the show if you will I've had

227
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,200
this nagging feeling that something was

228
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,540
missing that I was forgetting something

229
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,490
well it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out it was we went to a</font>

230
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,280
little company gathering on sunday night

231
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:47,930
and a colleague of mine had mentioned

232
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:50,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the agenda and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought</font>

233
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,310
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of a you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know kind of a mean</font>

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,910
joke or something but no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was on the</font>

235
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">agenda alright and here i am so i guess</font>

236
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,620
the joke was on me I did let something

237
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,180
slide and if it if it's me forgetting

238
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,020
that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the opening statement</font>

239
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,209
then I'll take the bullet so to speak so

240
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:11,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">on with the show Betty asked me to say a</font>

241
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:14,990
few words about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my experience in hosting</font>

242
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">nanog and all I can say is it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

243
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,370
commitment there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work that</font>

244
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,380
goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the folks in my office</font>

245
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,740
have affectionately called me the

246
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">wedding planner and actually hosting one</font>

247
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,190
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things makes putting on a</font>

248
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,610
wedding look a little bit like a

249
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:34,280
cakewalk because weddings don't have you

250
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:37,220
know big internet circuits<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have</font>

251
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,560
to bring in for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this group and I think</font>

252
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,110
the worst thing in the world would be to

253
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a connection to the net</font>

254
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,760
that didn't perform flawlessly it's

255
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,399
almost like you'd have to let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

256
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,170
for example you were I don't know a

257
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,560
cardiologist and you botched you know

258
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,750
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of operation with all the</font>

259
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,790
cardiologists the premier cardiologists

260
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,500
and in the world looking on so we didn't

261
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,010
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to botch that so I hope every is</font>

262
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,959
everybody on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net bow by the way</font>

263
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:09,339
everything's working<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great so we</font>

264
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">can tick that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one off our list so I've</font>

265
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,050
been to quite a few nanog over the last

266
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,000
few years you guys have probably seen me

267
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,849
you know drinking coffee and eating

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,160
cookies out in the hallway and

269
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:26,290
schlepping for peering but I've never

270
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:28,390
really had an appreciation for what goes

271
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,510
on behind the scenes in one of these

272
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:35,100
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> until I took on hosting this</font>

273
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,240
nanog well there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes on</font>

274
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,269
and I guess I'll just take this

275
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,209
opportunity to express my personal

276
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:46,149
gratitude to merit and the community

277
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:48,670
that makes nanog what it is you guys are

278

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,410
a lot of the kinks going forward and I

289
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:19,359
hope you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this nanog is is evidence</font>

295
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:37,510
there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> miles of cable</font>

296
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,670
laying on the ground again there's a lot

297
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,529
that goes into putting these things on

298
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,019
it ain't magic that make these makes

299
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:46,899
these things go off without a hitch so

Seattle and Vienna we're evolving and

I'm sure everybody in the room shares

319
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,470
that with me I think part of our

nanog we as a community and I'll just

322
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,850
speak for myself value what this

324
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:07,700
the internet this community I think

325
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,490
values our participation on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo</font>

326

side and we are part of this community

327
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:17,000
and it is becoming and has become part

328
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:20,720
of us we all need to keep it alive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,550
help nurture and help it grow and so I

330
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">would encourage anybody the in the</font>

331
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:28,430
audience to consider hosting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana it's</font>

332
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> experience we've had a lot</font>

333
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:36,170
of discussions internally about the

334
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:38,510
prospect of of hosting an anode and it's

335
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:42,979
an interesting process and it kind of

336
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:45,410
goes like this well what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano and why</font>

337
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:49,700
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do this what's what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ROI</font>

338
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:51,350
and so we've broken it down to how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

339
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,050
megabits per second we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

340
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,930
in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new peering and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan Goulding</font>

341
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,430
was kind of joking around so we're going

342
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,199
to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thermometer that shows</font>

343
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,910
where we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bringing up new peering</font>

344
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,160
sessions and once we hit the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

345
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,969
thermometer then we've broken even so

346
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,329
and then we'll kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do</font>

347
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:11,250
kera does with the public radio and take

348
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:13,138
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the microphone and stop the whole</font>

349
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,220
thing while we do a pledge drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

350
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:18,629
peering or something I'm joking but we

351
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,949
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I've talked to some</font>

352
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:22,290
other people in the audience that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

353
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:23,279
considering hosting nanog and it sounds

354
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,490
like they've gone through the same

355
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,970
process as well but I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

356
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:32,699
about ROI it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about supporting the</font>

357
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:35,519
community it's about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of taking</font>

358
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:37,740
responsibility and saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's it's</font>

359
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,930
our turn there's some other folks that

360
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">have stepped up and and hosted in the</font>

361
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:46,709
past and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo's turned to do the</font>

362
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:50,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing so again I encourage you to</font>

363
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:53,239
consider taking responsibility and

364
00:16:50,189 --> 00:17:01,639
hosting nanog going forward avoid

365
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:04,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Valentine's Day yeah and Nor'easters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

366
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:07,020
think we're going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a smaller</font>

367
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,439
crowd this round because I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard on</font>

368
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,689
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> radio there are 26 inches of snow</font>

369
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,900
sitting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ground in Central Park I</font>

370
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:17,909
think there's also 26 inches of snow in

371
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Washington area as well so some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

372
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:22,530
our colleagues are likely not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here today</font>

373
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:25,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">because because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the nor'easter that</font>

374
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:28,049
blew through<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently if you host feel</font>

375
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,760
free to call us for advice the best

376
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:33,360
piece of advice I can give you is to

377
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,850
start early on that circuit we had a

378
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:42,959
little bit of a major gotcha it's not a

379
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:44,908
little issue here we aside from the AXA

380
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,130
aside from this statement we were

381
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:50,370
unprepared on the on the access point

382
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:54,690
earlier on it turns out in working with

383
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:58,949
the good people at AT&T that while there

384
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:01,409
was no problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> delivering a ds3 it turns</font>

385
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,440
out that on the twenty-third of December

386
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:06,720
they discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> that their fiber that</font>

387
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">came into the hotel terminated in the</font>

388
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,419
basement<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the parking garage that's</font>

389
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:15,059
about 60<font color="#CCCCCC"> feet from where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it needed to</font>

390
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,919
terminate but you know in a in a hotel

391
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,889
like this 60 feet might as well be a

392
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,000
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> miles and</font>

393
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,290
so you know you're sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on the</font>

394
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,030
twenty-third of December and you're

395
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,399
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok the Nano gets coming up we'd</font>

396
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:29,180
better get this done and so I just

397
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,250
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok let's just let's just do this</font>

398
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,020
ourselves so a colleague of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brad</font>

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">Parker are Todd Parker and I just</font>

400
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided to come down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with with the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ATT folks and pull some interred up from</font>

402
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,120
the basement of the parking garage I

403
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,520
mean it's kind of a mess down<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you</font>

404
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,530
know length introduct over sprinkler

pipes and tie wrapping and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

406
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:51,010
things I mean it's not pretty but it's

407
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:52,850
done but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again that's just kind of a</font>

408
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,090
illustration of what you have to do

409
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes to bring this thing up and I</font>

410
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:06,139
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's been again worth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you don't</font>

411
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:08,419
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the horror of uh not</font>

412
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,700
delivering a big fat circuit can do to

413
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:16,370
motivate people yours truly will stand

414
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:19,420
as testament to that so we have a group

415
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:23,830
of colleagues that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to thank</font>
