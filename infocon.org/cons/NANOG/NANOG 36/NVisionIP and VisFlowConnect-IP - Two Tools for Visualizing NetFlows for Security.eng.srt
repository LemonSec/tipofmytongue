1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,640
thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind introduction and</font>

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,420
I'm delighted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be here on Valentine's</font>

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,040
Day the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next detox are very well</font>

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,620
coordinated so you'll feel the love of

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,410
net flows and particularly visualizing

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,119
Netflix it's a really hot field and

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,100
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are only two of the tools is</font>

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,619
there's probably about a dozen tools out

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,119
there so um maybe each individual tool

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,250
is a little different but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that the consensus is there's</font>

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,980
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this if a little bit better</font>

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,899
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say is we are an edge network and</font>

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,129
we sink a lot of traffic that people

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,680
that rent our CPU cycles that do large

16
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,540
problems on our super computers so this

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,510
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an this is an edge network that's</font>

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,730
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP domain but we've</font>

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,710
worked with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are used by large</font>

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,828
edge networks that have multiple let's

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,230
say clay st IP address spaces so they're

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,699
starting it's this tool looks like these

23
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,279
tools i'll be discussing looks like

24
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,718
they'll be very amenable to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,900
environment and on ask for your feedback

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:09,659
about that as you begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use them so</font>

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,549
we this is a brief overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk</font>

28
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,950
and I'm of course we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be able to</font>

29
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,450
discuss everything about the UM about

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,799
these tools and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,869
references at the end and these slides

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,299
are online and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could contact me and</font>

33
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,799
on the the tools themselves are freely

34
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,750
available on the internet for<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">executable is downloadable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,320
open source but it's not there yet so

37
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,320
the urls will be listed in the slides

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,669
and you'll see them so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,500
talk a little bit about why we want this

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,140
direction in a little bit at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> love of</font>

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">net flows for security in particular and</font>

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,799
then the brief description of the two

43
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:47,640
tools are giving an overview and then a

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:50,460
summary so the the motivation is I don't

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,140
think when I came here I wasn't sure of

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,970
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are on to the net flows</font>

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,979
for security but if their scenes the the

48
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,689
intro to security talk and in hearing

49
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,130
the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob people are using</font>

50
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,839
netflix for security in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

51
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,699
some of the other communities that are

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the forefront like say the first</font>

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,540
community was one of the first

54
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,020
communities that saw the power of a of

55
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,280
netflix for security particularly we you

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,880
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be told that you could</font>

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">live in a large environment</font>

58
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,470
I mean large in multiple senses<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

59
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,970
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of objects you need to</font>

60
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,210
manage and you have large volumes of

61
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,950
data so you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really you're not</font>

62
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,470
looking for data you have more data than

63
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,869
you can handle and then this data itself

64
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,460
is complex each let's say each type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

65
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,690
log has records and the records each

66
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,430
have multiple fields and the

67
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,480
combinatorial oh if you look at all the

68
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,480
relationships between all the different

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,890
fields so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's just say you solve</font>

70
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,950
it you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in one</font>

71
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance in time well the Devils in the</font>

72
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">details and things change quickly you</font>

73
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,810
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> time dynamics if things are</font>

74
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,299
changing there's it is a static so this

75
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,400
is a difficult problem so visualization

76
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,680
can help visualization basically is just

77
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">a representation of data in a different</font>

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,410
domain and humans are particularly this

79
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,090
the way we learn I have two young

80
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,200
children and then I could see the from

81
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,000
if you know they learn visually so our

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,940
brands are geared toward<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time</font>

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,100
processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of visual data so let's let's</font>

84
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,460
leverage this<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44 on our network</font>

85
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,870
management domain and for security and

86
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,980
looks like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense we don't want</font>

87
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,120
to reinvent the wheel there's a lot of

88
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have been studying this in</font>

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,600
psychology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and human factors</font>

90
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,180
human-computer interaction and one of

91
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,040
the paradigms they give the consensus is

92
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,600
is that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to overview the day to</font>

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,250
get as much data as you can in front of

94
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,870
the user and then allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user to</font>

95
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,090
interact and browse with the data and

96
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">then have the user interact and to dig</font>

97
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,140
down for details on demand within the

98
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,090
data so this is a sort of a mantra

99
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,440
that's dumb come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the human</font>

100
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,270
factor so you make computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> action</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> field</font>

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,209
that's a little bit of um<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind their</font>

102
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:51,040
design of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our tools so so if you allow</font>

103
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">me I'll do the on the love for netflix</font>

104
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,420
for security and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit ticker I</font>

105
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,830
think everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you use net flows</font>

106
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,329
for security in different ways but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

107
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,970
is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of put on a laundry list</font>

108
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:05,020
of ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we use in netflix</font>

109
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:07,270
for security so in particular net flows

110
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,220
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection oriented statistics so you</font>

111
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,980
know who's you know source destination

112
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,170
pairs and you know like what what

113
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,738
services are using and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time stamps</font>

114
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when it happened the question is is</font>

115
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:21,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">that um you know what kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things can</font>

116
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,410
you identify with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you have IDs</font>

117
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,729
alarms<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like particularly the</font>

118
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,270
signature bass that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look in the data</font>

119
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,800
field so net flow

120
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,659
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular don't look at the data</font>

121
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,949
field<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can configure different types</font>

122
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,979
in that flows to do that particularly

123
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:36,650
Argus I know university of chicago was

124
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:38,000
um enabling the<font color="#CCCCCC"> argus type of net flows</font>

125
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,500
or different forms of net flows that

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,300
look at the first 64 bytes of net flows

127
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,770
on the data packet the look at the state

128
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,180
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 bytes you can actually</font>

129
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,030
identify a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in that</font>

130
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,009
little bit of space so but in general

131
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,378
<font color="#CCCCCC">most people don't use the data on the</font>

132
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">data field so the connection oriented</font>

133
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:58,970
things you'll see or like hi bye

134
00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:01,880
transfers for dos attacks or on things

135
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,979
that are like doing a like laptops that

136
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,080
are some that are transmitting a lot of

137
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:07,758
information that typically wouldn't be

138
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,039
doing that or connections a lot of

139
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,740
kannamma a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of attempts that on would</font>

140
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen from machines you wouldn't figure</font>

141
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,220
them should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing that so those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

142
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,210
the that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the highest value</font>

143
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">but then there's a whole bunch of other</font>

144
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,719

150
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:29,930
see on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network and see the activity</font>

151
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:33,469
and sort of get familiar with the

152
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,840
behavior um who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are your top talkers</font>

153
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:38,659
this is a common one in many places of

154
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,609
work and may in place of observed all

155

long live long live connections you sort

162

on different on some peer-to-peer

177
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:32,060
activity you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely see that in</font>

178
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,169
law net flows<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in particular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like on</font>

179
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,539
our network we're looking at what

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,440
reason if you know there's a

183
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,150
ability out there that's been announced

184
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,830
maybe not patched yet you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

185
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,090
keep an eye on that activity on that

186
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">port to see if people are trying to</font>

187
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:52,270
prove a port for vulnerability that you

188
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:54,880
know about and lastly i'm sure most of

189
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,560
you have a black lists of even post you

190
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,590
know their malicious or domains of your

191

suspicious of or mature posted or

192
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,650
continuously compromised you know you

193
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,360
keep track of these and you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

194
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,919
these for you in your net flows so this

195
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a laundry list of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

196
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,340
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflix it's not everything it's</font>

197
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,740
meant to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> complimentary tool to</font>

198
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,130
let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your IDs infrastructure</font>

199
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,630
um maybe your syslog infrastructure but

200
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,050
it's definitely there's a conciseness in

201
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:23,770
a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent this data on that so</font>

202
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:26,080
this is value just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the pure raw data</font>

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:30,729
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tectum whether you use a skier you</font>

205
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:36,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go step beyond and look</font>

206
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,110
at netflix for visualization out so ago

207
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,400
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more pertinent for the edge</font>

208
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,780
network but there's different ways of

209
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,270
getting your net flows i'll just say

210
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,429
that on we got we get our or netflix

211
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,960
from our cisco routers and we distribute

212
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,140
the routers and aggregate them so we're

213
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,190
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always trying to get the list um get</font>

214
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:56,530
the net flows from or our border router

215
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,270
particularly there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpu head and as</font>

216
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,609
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let's say four gigabytes and</font>

217
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:04,090
above there's a third arm a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

218
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,970
routers don't even support on raw net

219
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,229
flows they want a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sample and for the</font>

220
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,340
main i'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for security</font>

221
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,050
do you really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want sample net</font>

222
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,210
flows so you won't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to distribute it</font>

223
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,430
your collection ability and then

224
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,680
aggregate these net flows and merge and

225
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,720
delete duplicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow records and</font>

226
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,840
things of that nature we also deploy on

227
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source argus for net flows</font>

228
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,580
which is a sensor you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put on a pc</font>

229
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,760
you can gather the data it probes all

230
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:33,458
over your network and they're different

231
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,679
I mean it's in one sense Argus and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco</font>

232
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:37,958
net flows add a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> complementary</font>

233
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,390
power so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> auriga's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bidirectional</font>

234
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,098
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cisco is unidirectional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um let's say</font>

235
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,260
that there's there's cash off

236
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,000
configurable<font color="#CCCCCC"> off thing there's you can</font>

237
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,610
set the caches let's say you can set the

238
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,410
the cisco default is 30 minutes you

239
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,970
could we set our<font color="#E5E5E5"> august default at one</font>

240
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute so you have different views in</font>

241
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,670
different time<font color="#CCCCCC"> frame so this</font>

242
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,350
a little bit we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could go into detail on</font>

243
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at some more papers about how we</font>

244
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,030
use the power of net flows to UM

245
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">instrumented of a network so this would</font>

246
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a little bit different we'd like to</font>

247
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,830
see on what people instrument their net

248
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,470
flows on there in there within their isp

249
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,670
ok so the meat of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meat of the talk</font>

250
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,010
now is about these two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools</font>

251
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,750
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have a lot of time to go over</font>

252
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,069
the details of all these tools but i'll

253
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,510
show you the picture the pictures you

254
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,040
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pictures are worth a thousand</font>

255
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,810
words and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them some papers to</font>

256
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,730
describe the use like sorta like manuals

257
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to step you through if you download the</font>

258
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,550
tools and 1am see well how they work so

259
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,130
the two tools or<font color="#CCCCCC"> nvision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and vis flow</font>

260
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:38,140
connect IPA so there's the UM<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL to</font>

261
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">download this tool and there's a</font>

262
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:45,400
description of the tool that address

263
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:47,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so whoops the this tool is a</font>

264
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,240
three-level tool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the the</font>

265
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,620
mantra that's come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the human</font>

266
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,840
factors communities you want to overview

267
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:56,650
first then browse and drill down on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

268
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">man so it's a three level tool so the</font>

269
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,939
first level we call the galaxy view

270
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,140
which is the UM the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lowest view and that</font>

271
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually shows you an overview of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

272
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,520
network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a week all</font>

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,720
the small multiple view which is really

274
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,520
the subnet view that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually</font>

275
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,050
scan your network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then if you</font>

276
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,770
identify particular host want to look at

277
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,150
we have the machine view so at first you

278
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,790
have let's say the overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

279
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,560
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what this is is um</font>

280
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,829
let's say sure if you can see in the

281
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,180
back but there's there's a screen with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

282
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,920
square in the middle has dots on it in

283
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,260
each of these dots represents an IP

284
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,719
address the color and the shape of that

285
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,030
IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is settable by the user for</font>

286
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,390
on different different parameters let's

287
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,290
say particularly the first intuitive

288
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,939
thing you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to look for is what</font>

289
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,010
the bite transfer is in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of each</font>

290
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,440
IP address and what the UM connections

291
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,450
are per period time for our IP address

292
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,190
so you can set like hi bye transfers and

293
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,200
high connections over a period of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

294
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,430
to let say<font color="#CCCCCC"> read and then have that shape</font>

295
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,200
be like an exclamation<font color="#E5E5E5"> point or whatever</font>

296
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,359
so there's only so many things you can

297
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,950
do it net flows I mean the there's

298
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,830
there's a finite number of field so

299
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,790
particular week the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> can set what</font>

300
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,380
they want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for is for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

301
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,160
protocols you can look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all protocols</font>

302
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,500
you can just drill down for TCP you

303
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,000
p<font color="#CCCCCC"> icmp et cetera you can look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

304
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">different port activities given for all</font>

305
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,600
ports you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for specific ports or</font>

306
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:17,329
range of ports and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

307
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,220
let's say the number bytes or number

308
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:20,750
connections per period of time and we've

309
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,980
already mentioned that and then you can

310
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,569
also look for let's say everything or

311
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for just sources just</font>

312
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:30,110
destinations or any combination of the

313
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:31,790
two so what we've done is<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoarded</font>

314
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,889
anything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think of an SQL query</font>

315
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,839
to a database and part coded into this

316
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:37,579
application reason we've done that is is

317
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,060
now it's optimized so you can run<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

318
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:42,500
quarries real fast what we we don't

319
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,910
think it's really a good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font>

320
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,980
say take your net flows and always load

321
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,839
it into a database so something that's

322
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,490
the approach of some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do but we</font>

323
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,660
find that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the depends on rolling your</font>

324
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,009
network if you have a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

325
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,110
can scale and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can blow it load it</font>

326
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:55,610
all in database that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine we we use</font>

327
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,589
this tool we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Royal</font>

328
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,910
net flows load them into this tool we

329
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:04,189
don't have to worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the</font>

330
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:06,079
scalability of a database so we have an

331
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:09,980
animation tool bar so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually</font>

332
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,540
see how the net flows change on your a

333
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,920
state of different IP addresses on your

334
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,259
network we have an animation tool bar

335
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,240
that goes in time we have a clock<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

336
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:19,240
shows us the time pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamp</font>

337
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,220
so but so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overview of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

338
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,269
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as you can back in the room</font>

339
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you came and see we have a magnifying</font>

340
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:30,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">glass that's all part of one of the</font>

341
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,819
widgets the attached of this tool but in

342
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">general this is an overview and it can</font>

343
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,699
use to give you context of what's going

344
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,410
on your network and we find that them

345
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:38,660
you can identify things very easily on

346
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,370
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our edge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> networks we see our clusters</font>

347
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,230
pop up and where our servers are placed

348
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,610
but in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular you might want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

349
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,980
drill down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you interact with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

350
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,000
using a mouse um to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

351
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,709
see this part of the network then you'll

352
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">get what they call the small multiple</font>

353
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:53,479
view or the domain view and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

354
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:54,860
allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is much like a stock</font>

355
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">broker would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like scan the Wall Street</font>

356
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,180
Journal look for like they're they call

357
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,819
them um spark diagrams<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what how</font>

358
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,349
stocks are going up or down<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

359
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:04,910
browse over your IP address space and

360
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,709
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you could highlight different</font>

361
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,660
ports that's what the legend is on the

362
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,609
left with the different color codes and

363
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,469
see like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for let's say mail</font>

364
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,480
servers or you can look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for like um</font>

365
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,589
telnet<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know plaintext password</font>

366
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,600
things so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can look for any type of</font>

367
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:19,309
service you can just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a color you</font>

368
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,400
like and then scan over the IP address

369
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:21,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait place</font>

370
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,949
allows you to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over your IP address</font>

371
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,570
space and scan for different things

372
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,430
notice there's no annotation there's no

373
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:30,210
numbers or words on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's meant to</font>

374
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:32,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">just be a browsing tool famous um so</font>

375
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,900
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not saying that what I what I</font>

376
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:39,990
just said<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so each each diagram each</font>

377
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,980
each block in there you may not show up

378
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the back cover and they're sort of</font>

379
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a rectangular block where you see</font>

380
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,710
these histograms each block contains an

381
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,800
upper histogram and a lower histogram

382
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:52,530
the upper histogram is activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

383
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,479
imports for that IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

384
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:57,780
lower histogram which is in typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

385
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,270
blue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> grey represents ports / 1024 so</font>

386
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,790
you can identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> one imports by their</font>

387
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:05,100
colors and then the port distribution of

388
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ephraim reports above 1024 that you</font>

389
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,090
really look for a distribution so that

390
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,370
you can see how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

391
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,620
allowed to scan of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and then</font>

392
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,970
you particularly identify let's say that

393
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,920
particular IP address what's interesting

394
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,140
then you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to the machine view in</font>

395
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,150
machine view very you should come you

396
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,130
have multiple things at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UM at the</font>

397
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,290
top you have tabs it allows you to look

398
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,730
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> different dimensions like I said net</font>

399
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,800
flows has a finite number of fields if

400
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:32,670
you look at say<font color="#E5E5E5"> charm traffic for</font>

401
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,310
protocols traffic for ports on and the

402
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,900
top part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the this machine view allows</font>

403
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,489
you to look at let's say the aggregate

404
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,610
traffic both in an ad of that IP address

405
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">um again the using that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same concept we</font>

406
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,360
have the one imports and histogram at

407
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,329
the top and the ports / 10 24th in the

408
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">below that and then you have two sets of</font>

409
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,240
histograms on the other side showing the

410
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,150
traffic sourcing from that IP address

411
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the traffic sinking that IP address</font>

412
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,449
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how this could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

413
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,890
valuable if you want to see in a quickly

414
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,240
scan your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find out</font>

415
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,980
particularly what's going on in IP

416
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">address and you can also drill down and</font>

417
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually see the raw net flows from from</font>

418
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:10,230
this from this view that can associate

419
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:12,360
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that IP address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's this tool</font>

420
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,650
and vision IP it's meant to be a tool

421
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,290
that looks at the state of IP addresses

422
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,329
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a Class B so we know</font>

423
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,620
let's say campuses have multiple

424
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,450
campuses like in university of illinois

425
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,400
where ncsa is based as multiple campuses

426
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,020
you can we have multiple views of this

427
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,459
for each campus where you cannot say

428
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,170
universe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> minnesota i know has</font>

429
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,790
multiple class<font color="#CCCCCC"> b's you can have a</font>

430
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">different instance of this for each of</font>

431
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,230
your class b addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs you know</font>

432
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,180
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> Class B</font>

433
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,300
so our<font color="#E5E5E5"> class sees you can actually use</font>

434
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">this for once you want to drill down on</font>

435
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,530
not quite sure how<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP would use this</font>

436
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,180
and would really depend on the size of

437
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">your ISP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use this and that's what i'm</font>

438
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,469
here to present to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see if our</font>

439
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:54,750
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be interested to share their</font>

440
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:56,730
experiences the next to<font color="#CCCCCC"> liz is this this</font>

441
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,470
flow connect IP and briefly go through

442
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,420
this tool again the pictures of the

443
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,130
thousand words so<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things that</font>

444
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,810
happens is when you design the tool you

445
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,939
want to put everything you can in it so

446
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,469
we we tried to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> show and only</font>

447
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,570
the state of the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address but who is</font>

448
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,490
connecting who it got too much and we

449
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,380
work with people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's dual but we</font>

450
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually work with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stephen north of AT&T</font>

451
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,980
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed graph is and that some of</font>

452
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,110
you are familiar with that's with AT&T

453
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,560
the base of their tools look at all the

454
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,820
traffic when AT&T was<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the only</font>

455
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,410
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only way you can do</font>

456
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,300
international international traffic

457
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,589
right they were there ma belle so we

458
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,990
feel like we had a pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> view of</font>

459
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">this but we are just too much if you</font>

460
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,900
have too much data to obscure<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

461
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,490
you're trying to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at so or what we</font>

462
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,819
did is we separated out who was linking

463
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,590
to who from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> state of the envelope he</font>

464
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,150
addresses in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the and the linking link</font>

465
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:46,230
analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually turned it to this tool</font>

466
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:48,209
vis below connect IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the basic</font>

467
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,060
pyridine is is you have three vertical

468
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,940
lines and again we're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

469
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,170
edge network you can the middle line is

470
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,090
actually the edge network that you're

471
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,360
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage but an ISP could</font>

472
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:02,040
actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP you know</font>

473
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,260
you can set up a range of addresses

474
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,180
you're interested looking at so the two

475
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,280
outer lines represent outside domains

476
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,310
that are sourcing or sinking traffic to

477
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,480
your edge network so the the convention

478
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:16,740
is from left to right from from people

479
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,960
in the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know if this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is being</font>

480
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,120
broadcast over the Internet though<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

481
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">line from an outside domain access on</font>

482
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the left to the middle line means</font>

483
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,790
traffic signal sourcing into your

484
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,710
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then traffic from the middle</font>

485
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,480
line out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside domain on the</font>

486
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,250
right means traffic on sourcing from

487
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,660
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network out to the internet</font>

488
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,790
refer say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out your</font>

489
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,260
border router so it sort of intuitive

490
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,899
feel you see lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you see traffic</font>

491
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,040
coming in traffic going out and typical

492
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,180
question like a network manager would

493
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,620
say like what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our network</font>

494
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">well here's traffic going in traffic</font>

495
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,550
going out typically symmetric we've

496
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,820
we've sort of alarmed it so if there's a

497
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,040
cm

498
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,429
traffic flows that we have that alarmed

499
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can see that in particular so of</font>

500
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">course the time domain comes back and</font>

501
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,900
bite you again because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic</font>

502
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,400
changes in depending on how you

503
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,720
aggregate the traffic you're going to

504
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,820
obscure traffic so that's what we learn

505
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,840
from the graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> this people at AT&T is</font>

506
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,370
that if you're trying to show everything

507
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,320
you're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have a big blob</font>

508
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,239
there so what we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> created a</font>

509
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,370
time window that it's configured by the

510
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,350
user and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only shown that</font>

511
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,510
it's and within that time window and the

512
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:19,830
time window<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes across the tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

513
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,420
have VCR controls at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top that I'm</font>

514
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,889
allows you to let's say go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

515
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">forth you actually load ille you load a</font>

516
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,460
log file and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forth</font>

517
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a VCR and go back and forth you in</font>

518
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic and see who's connecting to do</font>

519
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,260
you have a clock and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

520
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,750
have exact time but also a human

521
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,910
intuitive time and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> highlight</font>

522
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,170
different ports the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seaport</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> activity so</font>

523
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,050
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this doesn't allow you to do</font>

524
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:41,910
is actually you want to UM if you wanted

525
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,320
to scan all the port port activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

526
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,540
think the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool we're although be</font>

527
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,129
shown is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Flamingo tool actually does</font>

528
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,480
a good job of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we this is highly</font>

529
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,560
scalable so we don't keep port

530
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,000
information because of the comment

531
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">ettore to that but if you know what</font>

532
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're looking for you can find it here</font>

533
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,930
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you're looking</font>

534
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to use some</font>

535
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,740
trial and error to find it you might

536
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,830
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the other tools particularly</font>

537
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,690
this Flamengo they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the next talk</font>

538
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:07,379
so look let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> just show you some quick</font>

539
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:09,180
examples so um first thing is if you

540
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,680
notice in this on previous picture here

541
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned this is outside domains</font>

542
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,700
coming to your network so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say we</font>

543
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,340
did some testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we found out like</font>

544
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,110
over 100k hosts and a typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> time here</font>

545
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,659
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at can't scale on a</font>

546
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,919
screen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't really Fliss OSI</font>

547
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,900
hosts coming internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> work so we just</font>

548
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,270
put domains but it turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

549
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">really useful for security because a lot</font>

550
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,080
of times you have a tax<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's multiple</font>

551
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,880
hosts within a single domain so it

552
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,550
seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be scalable in that sense so</font>

553
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,380
what we've done is we have a particular

554
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,300
domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> see activity that's interesting</font>

555
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,520
you click on that domain interactivity

556
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,110
you drill down and you have a domain

557
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,820
view so now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the different</font>

558
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,590
IP addresses in that domain are now

559
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,820
visible I'm seeing this is not showing

560
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,379
up that well but you can look take a

561
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,060
look at the slides on if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

562
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,500
download this offline but basically what

563
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,850
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it allows you to see activity</font>

564
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,440
from domains of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also</font>

565
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:59,100
individual who's within a particular

566
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,679
domain you specified so

567
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,870
this is a show too well<font color="#CCCCCC"> either but this</font>

568
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:08,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">is ms blaster if you want to show like a</font>

569
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:10,889
scan of a worm or some scanning activity

570
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,330
it shows up pretty clearly as a point on

571
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that side domain or an outside hose</font>

572
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:19,980
hitting all the IP addresses on your

573
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,299
network so in particular you have to

574
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the context of what's going on</font>

575
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:26,160
within your particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> network the edge</font>

576
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,870
network or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP so sometimes a scan isn't</font>

577
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was always a scan so here you see</font>

578
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,189
multiple connections from one domain or

579
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:35,039
in this particular one host is scanning

580
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,049
a portion of our or Class B address

581
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,360
space<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as you say I mean what is it</font>

582
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:41,429
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a worm is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody on like</font>

583
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,600
doing a vulnerability analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if</font>

584
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,970
he can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so we looked at this</font>

585
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,289
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and we braved it within</font>

586
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,480
the domain view we found out it was

587
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:51,780
consecutive IP addresses from the

588
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,669
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at consecutive IP</font>

589
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,470
addresses within ncsa and that's sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

590
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,720
unusual to see a scan that has that

591
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">characteristic we looked a little bit</font>

592
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,429
closer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> its IP addresses at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cal Tech</font>

593
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:04,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it turns out that the IP addresses</font>

594
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:06,000
in ncsa<font color="#E5E5E5"> were a cluster well it's the</font>

595
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,189
principle it's a cluster<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a caltech</font>

596
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,929
it's great to the grid it's great

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,600
communication cluster<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cluster we're</font>

598
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,890
actually our Clark are clusters at NCSA

599
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,689
or internet accessible so they're

600
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:18,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually running parallel jobs over the</font>

601
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,010
internet so sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask and you might</font>

602
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,000
might appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a scan this should</font>

603
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,860
gives you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a situation</font>

604
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,150
awareness and know what's happening just

605
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,770
because you have some characteristic

606
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,360
that looks like an IP address hitting a

607
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,668
bunch of other IP address it doesn't

608
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,918
only necessary i mean it is security on

609
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:38,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">its event that you're trained to look</font>

610
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:41,039
for so then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we have a</font>

611
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:42,929
lot of hits on particular IP addresses

612
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">at NCSA so we were like this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

613
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:48,480
particular characteristic pattern<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

614
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:51,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">received many times and we notice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

615
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,409
these are all our web servers and then

616
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,419
we looked at these and these are I of

617
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:55,919
web crawlers particular you know won't

618
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,179
tell you what company you know so we see

619
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,730
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening during a part of the day</font>

620
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,020
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> starting to see activity are</font>

621
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,429
using this<font color="#CCCCCC"> visse flow connect of who's</font>

622
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,990
doing what on our network and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

623
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:05,520
of an intuitive way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can show this</font>

624
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,110
to my boss and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my boss is oh yeah I</font>

625
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,850
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know we have great</font>

626
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,820
commuting we have the crawler sending

627
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,639
our network in a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and then</font>

628
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:17,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the picture tells a thousand words so</font>

629
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:18,709
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just activity coming into a</font>

630
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,419
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> of going out of a network that</font>

631
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,220
you're you might want to look at it as

632
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,409
an ISP is also we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at internal</font>

633
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,750
traffic sourcing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> syncing within</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

634
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:28,639
within one network so this might not

635
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,000
actually be the case of an ISP unless

636
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:33,439
you have like multiple multiple camp<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

637
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,669
multiple parts of the same organization

638
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,470
have the same address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space that would</font>

639
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,419
you know be going over an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP zhou</font>

640
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,679
backbone but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in particularly as they say</font>

641
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:42,230
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at our traffic within the</font>

642
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,509
network and this is much more clear that

643
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,509
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see on let's say one users is</font>

644
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:48,769
looking at different on I don't know if

645
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,759
there's a scan activity or somebody's

646
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,350
doing some activity in one of our

647
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,860
clusters with hitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a large part of</font>

650
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:02,210
intuitive and the URLs are there and

00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:06,320
i'll show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the references in a second</font>

652
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:08,330
um so it's in summary there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

653
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,918
activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> going in this space of not only</font>

do things with binary files were not

661
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,230
that's actually not how we're hardwired

662
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:30,409
when we're growing up so why don't we

sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of leverage leverage or human</font>

664
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:35,090
capacity I've set up a discussion list

665
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,710
for the on flow analysis i think there's

666
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,600
there's multiple these flow analysis

667
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,549

00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:55,340
that people in the operator community

702
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:58,129
are familiar with but not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it</font>

703
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,689
let you grab NetFlow data symmetrically

704
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,459
it also<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of</font>

705
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,820
performance information so a little bit

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,440
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP statistics lost latency so if</font>

707
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,899
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for justification to</font>

708
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,669
deploy wider net flow instrumentation

709
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:12,590
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some performance</font>

710
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:14,059
data as well and I don't know whether

711
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's any play with the tools that</font>

712
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:18,649
you're working on it looking at the

713
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,509
performance impact of flows and

714
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:22,399
correlating that that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

715
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:24,740
know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are doing just with</font>

717
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,179
Argus is a very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> gathering</font>

720
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:36,200
also very efficient very good pointed

721
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,490
out hi Roland dive in Cisco um yes

722
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,350
you're right a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are using</font>

723
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,070
various open sores and commercial tools

724
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:44,990
to use net flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> for security analysis I</font>

725
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,460
had a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so you know at least</font>

726
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,659
in our implementation of clothes glowing

727
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,080
tree now I'm sure other vendors have as

728
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:52,730
well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have both ingress and egress</font>

729
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">netflow capabilities now so you made no</font>

730
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,749
mention about unidirectional so it's

731
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:58,309
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to to do ingress and</font>

732
00:25:56,749 --> 00:26:00,169
egress depending on what you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

733
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:01,549
what portion your topology and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a</font>

734
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:03,080
question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I'd looked at this tool</font>

735
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:04,879
before some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your visualization</font>

736
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,580
stuffing with the waterfall displays and

737
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:09,350
stuff is pretty is pretty cool um in

738
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,820
reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> the paper that described it in</font>

739
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,619
there was an allusion to it on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

740
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,289
your slides it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's some</font>

741
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:17,539
data conversion required once the

742
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:20,330
flotilla tree has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been collected that it</font>

743
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:22,549
then has to be converted and then maybe

744
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,649
a batch manner into an internal format

745
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:28,519
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> envisioned can understand is that</font>

746
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:29,748
correct there's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

747
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:31,549
about this right now we don't have this

748
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:33,440
enable for streaming so you actually

749
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:35,299
were reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> the log files and the blog</font>

750
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,980
Klaus will use our 5-minute log files of

751
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:38,240
course when you know I know some people

752
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,950
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all</font>

753
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,480
offline processing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if you're</font>

754
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,340
looking for security five minutes is

755
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,160
about right because humans really don't

756
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,659
act on millisecond time frame so yeah so

757
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,280
that the other thing we do is you talk

758
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,429
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> different format so they say Argus</font>

759
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">or ghus um there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on how you</font>

760
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:56,000
configure Argus the readout you get from

761
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,559
Argus it's not standard it depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

762
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,840
how the user sets so we actually sets

763
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:02,090
like standard formats for them safe for

764
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,860
Argus and a medium for ncsa we have a

765
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:11,480
tool that you can use to convert any

766
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:13,219
version of netflix<font color="#CCCCCC"> n F and F dump tools</font>

767
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,780
we have another tool called canine it

768
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,090
actually does anonymization also it does

769
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,559
that so the reason why we do that is the

770
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,330
people have designed to different tools

771
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,649
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for their data source we're trying</font>

772
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make our tool independent into that</font>

773
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:26,960
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the so as far as the processing</font>

774
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,149
goes there's internal processing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

775
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,640
tool itself that actually bends the UM

776
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,410
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> data / IP address for nvision IP and</font>

777
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,000
it actually gets streaming statistics

778
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,920
for visto connect so this flow connect

779
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,050
this is more scalable we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't keep any</font>

780
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,980
state and vision IP has to keep state

781
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:43,669
cuz that's actually with the tool

782
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:45,740
represent so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um what else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can I say is</font>

783
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,179
that on so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some internal format</font>

784
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,450
but there is also an external format

785
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:52,840
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five-minute</font>

786
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">been is that hard coded or can you</font>

787
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,899
manually adjust that depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

788
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,790
much processing power you have available

789
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the conversion and then you adjust</font>

790
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:03,230
your flow timeout values on the routers

791
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,030
and other export devices accordingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

792
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,760
it's through a pletely user settable so

793
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:09,678
that's that's an ncsa we set it for

794
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,600
organization um you could set it for

795
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,429
anything on<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found that there's a</font>

796
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,139
certain limit though if you have a large

797
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:17,990
file with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic if you want</font>

798
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,190
to read in a gigabyte<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a log file it's</font>

799
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,200
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be much slower than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for reader</font>

800
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:25,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's say a megabyte law or so you say</font>

801
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,050
so you scale it for and then we we

802
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,139
actually open the file and go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

803
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:32,570
and read it<font color="#CCCCCC"> um open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the palm</font>

804
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,740
read it's sort of a streaming nature so

805
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,450
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we allow it we can actually</font>

806
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">navigate in and that file using these</font>

807
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,750
two are controls so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

808
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,950
read in the entire file you open access

809
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file and read you a little bit</font>

810
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,179
you can navigate through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lure so we</font>

811
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">can read large files on it you know but</font>

812
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:47,419
there are performance hits depending on

813
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> follow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the size of the file</font>

814
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:50,300
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at is completely</font>

815
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,740
independent so you could use her sis

816
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,070
what they want you can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it then but</font>

817
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,750
you can

818
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,850
Nate sighs father ambition I paid

819
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,980
correctly and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> final question are you</font>

820
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:01,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">planning on doing any further work on</font>

821
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,990
this tool to perhaps make use of the TCP

822
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,840
flag information that you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

823
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,940
flotilla tree you know fragmentation bit

824
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,040
drop traffic statistics things of that

825
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,500
nature it's a good question so we've

826
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,770
we've looked at that and right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're</font>

827
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,140
really relying on tools that are more

828
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:20,629
IDs base to look at them you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

829
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,580
safe flag type things you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

830
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,260
different patterns and the flag activity

831
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,550
right right now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really looking</font>

832
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">to visualize that now but that would be</font>

00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that on if you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tools</font>

flows and actually you could alarm on

836
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,040
you could alarm on that but that's um

837
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,540
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really looking to do that now</font>

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:50,479
also on on this gentleman's comments

843
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:53,180
about setting beds are any provisions

844
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,880
down the path of setting priorities on

845
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:58,640
certain traffic's or dropping supra<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre</font>

846
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,660
are certain traffic down depending on a

847
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,580
spike in on the network like for example

848
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,650
if you're seeing a tremendous amount of

849
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,050
traffic um and so I mean I understand it

850
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,360
a network monitoring but it be they'll

851
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:13,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">be cool to have some software provision</font>

852
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,540
where you can kind of dropped the

853
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:19,820
priority on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of our</font>

854
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:21,530
rate limit if you will so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> tal</font>

855
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Terr capabilities like the user can set</font>

856
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,710
so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to</font>

857
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,300
filter you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have ideas but we thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

858
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,100
user can said and you can you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

859
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,570
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop all your normal traffic and</font>

860
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,949
just look for things that thumb look

861
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,080
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> investigate</font>

862
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,210
so the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learning</font>

863
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">too is you actually kicking off yeah</font>

864
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,620
autumn and kicking off<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate-limiting</font>

865
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so this is that that's really a</font>

866
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,979
tough problem if you want to automate

867
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,389
this tool you're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like get an</font>

868
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,030
expert system from what security

869
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:48,860
engineers can do and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

870
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,720
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's it's difficult we</font>

871
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,340
have we have one we have one idea called

872
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,110
closing the loop what<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually goes back</font>

873
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and takes feedback from the user that's</font>

874
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,840
it are using this tool and goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and</font>

875
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,280
change with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source data they're</font>

876
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,899
getting depending on what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

877
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,520
interacts with on the screen like

878
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,720
usually using your visual interaction

879
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,370
with the mass you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

880
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,909
I want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this type of NetFlow</font>

881
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,820
data

882
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:09,529
um and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would actually pull</font>

883
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,820
gather different tool it's a difficult

884
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:12,919
problem right that's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open</font>

885
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,769
research problem now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if if</font>

886
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:18,409
you do that that will actually um one of

887
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:20,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">the things that people there is a</font>

888
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,979
trade-off here if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start alarming the</font>

889
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,299
visualizations and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's an</font>

890
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,710
arrow and it's blinking in its red

891
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,269
saying here this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

892
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,889
then what it does is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes your</font>

893
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">attention away from the screen of the</font>

894
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:31,008
wider information so then you mind if

895
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:32,959
you know what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at and you</font>

896
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:34,279
use machine learning algorithms do that

897
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,830
you might as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be using an IDs</font>

898
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:38,330
this is more of a wider tool that allows

899
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,259
you to like look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your environment and</font>

900
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,849
then you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this</font>

901
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:42,679
complimentary with an IDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

902
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:44,059
alarm so the alarm says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here's</font>

903
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:45,289
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at look at it and then</font>

904
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:47,720
you can look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen to choose</font>

905
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:49,639
you to pure traffic with what with the

906
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:54,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">HCI people tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us as soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you start</font>

907
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:55,998
alarming and focusing users ideas our

908
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:57,379
vision on certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

909
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,879
obscuring other things if you're a

910
00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:01,070
hundred percent accurate that's ideal

911
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:02,599
but we find that you know the ids is

912
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,460
nowhere near<font color="#CCCCCC"> a high percent accurate you</font>

913
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:06,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they're inaccurate their false</font>

914
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,570
positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> rates so we don't want to do</font>

915
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:10,279
more harm than good so we're what we're

916
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,019
doing is given the pure data allow the

917
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:14,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISP engineers like yourself to be able</font>

918
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:15,619
to see the raw data visualizer well it

919
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:18,168
wouldn't transfer on we're not actually

920
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:20,449
we're not changing anything and then you

921
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:22,580
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> interact with the data filter in</font>

922
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,109
different ways oh it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

923
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,689
great question and hopefully about

924
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:28,689
community cakes thank you sir
