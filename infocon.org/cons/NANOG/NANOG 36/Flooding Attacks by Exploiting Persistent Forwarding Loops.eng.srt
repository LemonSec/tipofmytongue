maybe some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to ask why they</font>

how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen</font>

so here i will give her you damn poor

this example just show that the mid

to the internet so what's the risk of a

64
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:10,290
position of all in moves here i will

65
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:12,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">give a simple example only three two</font>

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,000
for example the traffic to the address

68
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:22,710
why they will have a 40 moves between

of traffic oh we also go through the

78
00:04:50,370 --> 00:05:00,960

is overloaded by the Trifield to host a

<font color="#CCCCCC">while then the online bank service where</font>

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:14,580
big impact so in this case it is also in

82

I of service so persistent moves can

83
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,698

208

really large so there I wish your

several examples where the body moves

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:35,050

<font color="#CCCCCC">denial-of-service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if the link is flooded</font>

292
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:43,160
so to understand how many of kiowa is a

293
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:46,790
large eyes peas will be impact by

294
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:51,380
persistent appalling news we do have the

295
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:54,980
routers in the loose and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a user Tina is</font>

296
00:18:51,380 --> 00:19:00,680
lame to resolve it we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what</font>

297
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:04,360
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where the impact and from</font>

298
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:08,810
here we see that the unit AT&T Sprint

299
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:12,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">are else never three and quest all these</font>

300
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:15,980
large IPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are impact by the</font>

301
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:18,560
persistent of holding moves we also look

302
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:22,040
from the dinner<font color="#CCCCCC"> is name of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routers</font>

303
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,470
we look at the distribution of the

304
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,850
country's how many countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font>

305
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:33,590
impact and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that more than 120</font>

306
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:36,070
countries will be involved by this value

307
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,070
at half

308
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:47,350
so to understand how large the running

309
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:51,730
track field will be amplified in the 14

310
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:54,580
moves which also use a typical case to

311
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:59,320
calculate amplifications over the

312
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:04,029
furniture traffic here we even tacklers

313
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:07,178
want to do attack to flooding to further

314
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:11,529
the links they will send the traffic

315
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:16,179
with TTL value initial TTL value<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

316
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:19,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Elijah as possible suppose a 255 from</font>

317
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:24,639
our data we wonder have normally she

318
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:28,120
gotta work past<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 rotors to enter 14</font>

319
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:31,090
moves and the most of the case the 14

320
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,129
News had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zoning to half the law so in</font>

321
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,820
that case so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simply calculate</font>

322
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:44,980
that it'll will amplify the traffic 120

323
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:48,100
times so here we just estimate that how

324
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:52,330
easily the attacker can overload the

325
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:55,570
link suppose the valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valuable</font>

326
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:58,389
boundaries of the link pc is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 100 mega</font>

327
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:01,389
PPS and the number of a compromising

328
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:04,600
machine is 25 we know that it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

329
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:08,830
more if or they use a large net botnet

330
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,620
and they have more compromised host so

331
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:16,418
the average traffic a need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow the</font>

332
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:21,699
link is almost 33 kbps so it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> feasible</font>

333
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:26,259
quite easy to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or this rate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

334
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:30,179
only for even for the roof and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

335
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:33,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">would have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very have a long hot loops</font>

336
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:36,820
even for long boobs not have a 16 hops

337
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:45,490
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal can add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for amplify the</font>

338
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:49,090
technocratic about a 15 times so since

339
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:51,010
the flooding of riding attack exist in

340
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:54,220
the internet under

341
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:57,040
chemical reviews of products can cause

342
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,980
the president of<font color="#CCCCCC"> foreign oops here we</font>

343
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:04,240
want to verify that how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of position</font>

344
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:08,200
loops are caused by the poor abroad yeah

345
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:11,640
we have a simple heuristic to validate

346
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:15,900
the to validate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> proper odds</font>

347
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:21,340
miscalculations on gravel roads here we

348
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:25,060
seen that to a destination domain if the

349
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:27,850
some traffic a son<font color="#E5E5E5"> his rod they can</font>

reach to this nation<font color="#E5E5E5"> person they have a</font>

fall in loops if these two<font color="#CCCCCC"> traits they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">share the router inside in designating</font>

353
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:42,220
domain so we consider this case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple</font>

354
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,980
abroad and from our<font color="#E5E5E5"> result we found that</font>

355
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:48,010
almost seventy percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> resistant</font>

356
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:54,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">loops are caused by miscalculation of</font>

357
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:58,120
palabras so aged summary the first thing

358
00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:00,909
that position moves to exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

359
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:05,229
internet and the is also is a large

360
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:09,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of God voltages have presented of</font>

361
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:13,750
Allah news and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it will affect a lot</font>

362
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:16,290
of a legitimate host and also all these

363
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:20,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of us are widely distributed in the</font>

364
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:23,350
internet also the flooding attacks can

365
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:28,120
be launched from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mud called multiple</font>

366
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:31,659
locations and because it can amplify the

367
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:35,649
flooding care a traffic in the link so

368
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:38,530
you will affect the link and any eyes

369
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:41,410
peace nothing involved in the Fallen

370
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:44,230
oops finally we found rather that<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch</font>

371
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:47,700
your one is analyzed<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's ready in fact</font>

372
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:52,600
if someone not you're flooding attack

373
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:56,070
using precision of Allah<font color="#E5E5E5"> nerves so</font>

374
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,070
that's all thanks

375
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:16,050
yeah Jared launch<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntt America there was</font>

376
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,760
a one loop that was listed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

377
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,490
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you claimed was with one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

378
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,920
customers I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not follow your</font>

379
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:25,280
instructions<font color="#E5E5E5"> in not trace routing to it</font>

380
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,110
it turns out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customer that we</font>

381
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,830
transferred to some other provider but

382
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,780
the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS their cereal IPS were not</font>

383
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,030
remembered so it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer</font>

384
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,670
of some other provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went did let</font>

385
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:44,580
them know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that but in addition to</font>

386
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:46,620
that there is a question in my mind of

387
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,500
you found some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these is there a list</font>

388
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,879
of these that you can share with the

389
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,290
operators you may not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put them</font>

390
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,300
on a web page because people might

391
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,860
exploit them but have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you been sharing</font>

392
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,480
them with operators such that they can

393
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,969
look into them and attempt to fix them

394
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,180
oh yeah we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> share any information</font>

395
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:05,520
to outside and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were to some</font>

396
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:11,810
service and from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hover of readers</font>

397
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,810
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moves we have gone okay</font>

398
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:22,678
well if that's it we can move on to the

399
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:22,679
next talk
