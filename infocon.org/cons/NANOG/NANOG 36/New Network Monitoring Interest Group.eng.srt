00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,660
our special interest groups that we've

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,519
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on and to specifically that it</font>

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,660
just recently formed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think would</font>

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,379
be of some interest to the nanog

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,200
community overall we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> four special</font>

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,100
interest groups we have one composed of

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,870
vendors another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is doing CBS s</font>

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,250
the common vulnerability scoring system

20
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,980
that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen some in the</font>

21
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,840
press but our most our two most recent

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,629
are the abuse cig in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,100
monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> cig now the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of a special</font>

24
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,940
interest group within first which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,859
members-only organization is really to

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,949
be able to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> in regional initiatives</font>

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,339
and important topics and bring in

28
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,990
whoever we need so even non-members can

29
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,939
participate in these special interest

30
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,580
groups and they're usually driven by

31
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,070
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> within first but let's</font>

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,080
start with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> abuse cig for a minute is</font>

33
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,380
it abuse sick and it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we lost</font>

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,720
the URL in there was formed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

35
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,460
e-coat effort there's a organization

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">called ecoute the European cooperation</font>

37
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,908
of abuse fighting teams basically

38
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:33,750
composed of abuse at example.com type

39
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,520
domains and these guys have met I think

40
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,530
their fifth meeting was in January<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,810
they're becoming a cig underneath first

42
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,729
and we'll continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that under the</font>

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,950
first umbrella and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

44
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,630
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things was it's currently</font>

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,110
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> chaired by martin van der Heide</font>

46
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,820
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> kpn but when they when they voted</font>

47
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">to come under first and we took a look</font>

48
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,529
they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reven realize of the asian</font>

49
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,479
efforts that were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so the 20 or</font>

50
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,159
so teams that have been working on this

51
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,259
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> europe found out that there was</font>

52
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like 50 to 60 teams in Asia</font>

53
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are doing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing and one of</font>

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things it looks likes to</font>

55
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,139
missing to me is is worse the North

56
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,238
American component of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and the South</font>

57
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,440
American component so that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,540
reasons I'm up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of you</font>

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,810
dey say you know if you have folks that

60
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,519
are folks that are here today or folks

61
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,140
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your own organizations that are</font>

62
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,710
dealing with abuse they may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

63
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,700
participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this effort the second</font>

64
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:31,710
one to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

65
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,940
monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> sig there are some guys I</font>

66
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,370
don't know if you're familiar with the

67
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,100
efforts going on in like Korea where<font color="#CCCCCC"> KR</font>

68
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,870
cert has an extensive monitoring for

69
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,120
their whole country and other countries

70
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,960
as well but there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> group that's</font>

71
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,090
forming to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to share those</font>

72
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,120
tools and add information in such a way

73
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,390
that we can do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> better early warning</font>

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,280
system if you will for malware spread

75
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,989
and that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff so our network</font>

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,970
monitoring sig is going to be focused on

77
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,910
on that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information sharing how</font>

78
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,859
can you sanitize data share data or even

79
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:09,990
just share tools and best practices to

80
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,930
accomplish this so lastly and again we

81
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,190
lost another URL in there many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

82
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,320
individuals that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on this</font>

83
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,820
will be at our 2006 conference which is

84
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,769
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be held in Baltimore which is</font>

85
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,230
extremely convenient for for most North

86
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,870
Americans to get to and there are

87
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">international airports there if you have</font>

88
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,280
foreign counterparts who may want to

89
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,730
attend and I suspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there will be</font>

90
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,280
some activity around these efforts in

91
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,640
the hallways or it pops and whatnot at

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference lastly some contact</font>

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,440
information myself the URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> for our</font>

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,660
organization where you can find more

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,700
information right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

96
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,320
web pages for these for the last 26

97
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,720
because they literally just<font color="#E5E5E5"> started a</font>

98
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,340
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so when they get</font>

99
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,870
their web corner up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll try to</font>

100
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,150
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's prominences you can</font>

101
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,060
find more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about it and if</font>

102
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,190
you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to ask me how you</font>

103
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,510
