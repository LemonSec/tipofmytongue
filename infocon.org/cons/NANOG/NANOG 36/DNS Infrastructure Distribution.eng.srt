00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:08,099
hi so<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the nanog in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Seattle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,410
spring<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave a talk on what I was</font>

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">calling internet mini cars look parts of</font>

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,330
the world that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very well connected</font>

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">internally but don't have a lot of</font>

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,930
connectivity to the rest of the world so

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,359
in those areas local communications

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,930
should be a lot more reliable than

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,970
long-distance communications except that

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,830
in a lot of cases there's infrastructure

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,489
that's needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate with people</font>

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,800
who are local that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

13
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,160
exist locally so you end up relying on

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,949
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-distance infrastructure anyway</font>

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,029
so that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get all the</font>

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems that you have with</font>

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,090
long-distance communications unreliable

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,800
links that may fail and things being

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,890
slow and expensive even on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your local</font>

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,010
communications so what i'm doing here is

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:03,510
taking a look at the DNS infrastructure

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:06,798
which is required for most

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:12,530
communications on the internet and

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:16,020
excuse me and where the servers are for

25
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:19,259
the root servers and servers for the

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">top-level domains that are required to</font>

27
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,049
do dns lookups and which TLD is should

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,229
work in which parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and</font>

29
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thing and since the dns is</font>

30
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,829
a hierarchy this means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

31
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,470
trying to look up a fully qualified

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,750

33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,908
isn't already in your local cash you

34
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,680
need access to everything above what

35
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,750
you're looking up in that hierarchy so

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,479
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain you're looking up</font>

37
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,810
any domains above that that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> aldi it's</font>

38
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,360
in the root and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,810

completely broken and indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we look</font>

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,790

59
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,980
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> route dns server that which</font>

60
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:47,190
means that they may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do</font>

61
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,579
dns lookups in that scenario and because

62
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,400
of that nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> would work so looking at</font>

63
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,200
the root servers right now including all

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,970
the anycast copies I think there are

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,530
currently a hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten root servers</font>

66
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,540
and that say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that's changing</font>

67
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty rapidly there are constantly new</font>

68
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,160
ones being deployed so that was the

69
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,380
number last week it may be different by

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,060
now that's certainly a lot higher than

71
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,660
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was when I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this project a few</font>

72
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">months ago there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are 13 root server IP</font>

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,000
addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're operated by 12</font>

74
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,250
organizations bear signs got two of them

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,590
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that from any location at</font>

76
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,050
any one time there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are at most 13 root</font>

77
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,500
servers that are visible six of those

78
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,560
are any casted meaning several copies of

79
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:37,350
the same IP address in different places

80
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:45,740
and four of those are any the ones

81
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:51,480
operated by ISC autonomic<font color="#CCCCCC"> ripe and</font>

82
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">variscite okay are any tested in large</font>

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,739
numbers and then there are two more that

84
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,540
have just a few locations and then the

85
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,260
unicast ones the ones that have only one

86
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,540
server associated with that IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

87
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,850
there are still seven of those and all

88
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,579
of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three metropolitan areas</font>

in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. san francisco bay area los</font>

90
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,690
angeles and washington DC and then

91
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:22,590
distribution by continent<font color="#CCCCCC"> North America</font>

92
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:26,200
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Europe each have 30 for root server</font>

93
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:29,080
copies as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

the the huge clusters in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. that</font>

95
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,770
the distributions look very different

96
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,080
between the two continents that the US

97
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,479
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few huge clusters so there are</font>

98
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,780
eight each in san francisco bay<font color="#CCCCCC"> area and</font>

99
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,750
the Washington DC area and five of them

100
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">in Los Angeles and then a bunch of</font>

101
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,800
others up and down the east and<font color="#CCCCCC"> west</font>

102
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,330
coasts and then chicago and atlanta are

103
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,240
the only two places<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the u.s. that</font>

105
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,380
servers and then in North America

106
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,300
outside of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. there are three of</font>

107
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:07,630
them toronto and ottawa in canada and

108
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:11,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">monterey in Mexico whereas the 34 in</font>

109
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,180

112
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:20,620
and those are the sites of Europe's two

113
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,810
largest exchange points and then

114
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,430
throughout the rest of Europe or at

115
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:29,380
least Western Europe they're pretty

116
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:31,330
evenly distributed Asia if we exclude

117
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,520
the the Middle East that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty far</font>

in India Korea and Singapore to in Hong

Kong Jakarta Indonesia and Beijing and

124
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,969
then some really rapid expansion going

125
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,240
on in South Asia when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

126
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:07,740
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were no root servers</font>

127
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,820
anywhere between Bangkok and Dubai but

128
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">since then there have been the three</font>

129

installed in India one in Pakistan one

130
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,930
in Bangladesh I think there's one in

131
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,810
Nepal that's going in in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next few</font>

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,800
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's growing pretty rapidly</font>

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,080
probably the the most sparsely served

146
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:09,400
area because there's very little

147
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,409
intercity connectivity there so the one

148
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,270
in Nairobi for instance would be serving

149
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,949
really only the Nairobi metropolitan

150
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,049
area and nothing else<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be able to</font>

151
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,270
get in there without without satellite

152
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,710
connectivity or without going over the

153
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,430
satellite links probably through Europe

154
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:28,090
or North America and then to in South

155
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:34,210
America in Sao Paulo Brazil<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Santiago</font>

156
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:37,900
in Chile so then sorry this is being

157
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,448
slow here plotted this plotted them on a

158
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,400
map and different sizes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dots</font>

159
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:45,370
depending on how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in each</font>

160
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,570
location so you can see the the few big

161
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,669
cluster is in the eastern<font color="#CCCCCC"> and western</font>

162
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:52,870
and the east and<font color="#E5E5E5"> west coast of the US</font>

163
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:56,219
and then to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of where</font>

164
00:07:52,870 --> 00:08:00,250
this was actually providing service I

165
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,050
took all the fiber maps I could find and

166
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,070
overlaid them all on each other and then

167
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,690
overlaid them on these dots and so it

168
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">looks like these are the areas that</font>

169
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:14,050
should have redundant connectivity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

170
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,789
the root servers everywhere else as I

171
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,260
think just one fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> crowder one</font>

172
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:21,580
satellite link failure away from being

173
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:23,530
cut off so this matches what you see in

174
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution of a lot of other forms of</font>

175
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,489
infrastructure it's you know pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

176
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:33,338
the areas that have money and a few

177
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:35,740
others so that's not entirely surprising

178
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:39,130
but maybe shows with where there's some

179
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,169
work to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done on this and then as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

180
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:45,279
said the root server infrastructure is

181
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:48,400
expanding fairly rapidly so I think

182
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,420
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three years ago was when the</font>

183
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,760
anycast expansion

184
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,209
started so three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago there were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 13</font>

185
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,439
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and now there are 110 so</font>

186
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:59,500
assuming that expansion pace continues

187
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,850
then hopefully that area that's not

188
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:07,990
covered well should should be shrinking

189
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:10,480
considerably and two of the operators in

190
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,600
particular autonomic and ISC who operate

191
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,490
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I rude and the f</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route are doing</font>

192
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,899
lots of installs I think pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

193
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:22,660
wherever they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get funding to do it</font>

194
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:27,339
so fundings coming from I guess at least

195
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">two of the rirs ripe and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ap neck have</font>

196
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,870
been funding a lot of that and then

197
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,490
local governments and isp associations

198
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,730
also often think they get some benefit

199
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,110
from this so they put money into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

200
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,610
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the limitation in the</font>

201
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,160
areas that currently don't have these is

202
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,110
often just lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money to pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

203
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,370
or lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement on who should pay</font>

204
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,470
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or something of that sorry well</font>

205
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,089
once I defected this is that large

206
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,829
portions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the world the several</font>

208
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:58,689
and since you've got it most so that

209
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,370
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at most two of the root</font>

210
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,260
server IP addresses are visible local

211
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:06,010
even if there may be several more root

212
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,959
servers nearby and there are a couple of

213
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,600
potential effects of this one of which

214
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,619
is that bind which is the DNS resolver

215
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:18,339
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is probably used most has</font>

216
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,410
some things built into it that look for

217
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:23,110
the closest server and try to try to use

218
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,959
the DNS servers that are performing best

219
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember when something fails and</font>

220
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:32,410
doesn't have to keep timing out on it so

221
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:37,089
if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the routing protocol</font>

222
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:38,769
topology instead of bind dictating which

223

of these several<font color="#E5E5E5"> nearby root servers you</font>

224
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:44,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see then you don't get to use that</font>

225
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:48,579
I've also been told that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some non bind</font>

226
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:52,170
dns implementations deuce do some things

00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:54,339
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this really non ideal either</font>

228
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:57,490
either just picking a root server at

00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:58,720
random which may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be far away or starting</font>

230
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,760
at the beginning with the a route that's

unique ested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> virginia and sending all</font>

their queries there even though there

233
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,620
may be other

234
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,240
that are closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this leads to a</font>

235
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,070
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> of whether there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be a</font>

236
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,740
bigger effort to get all of them you

237
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,500
know distributed more evenly and that's

238
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">really beyond the data gathering thing i</font>

239
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,070
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing here so i started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,600
other studies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would address that</font>

241
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,399
and the only thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was able to find</font>

242
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,060
was a study done by some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> at kada</font>

243
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:27,579
in 2003 on optimal placement of the root

244
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,810
servers but their study assumed that

245
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:30,489
there were a maximum of thirteen

246
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,829
possible locations which means that

247
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">their results aren't really relevant now</font>

248
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:37,199
but it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be neat if they redid that</font>

249
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,850
with a different set<font color="#E5E5E5"> of assumptions or</font>

250
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:41,829
if somebody else did something using

251
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:47,050
their methodology or some approximation

252
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:49,029
of it and then as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see there as</font>

253
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,630
pointed out before there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some really</font>

254
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:53,920
big clusters and this tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw lots</font>

255
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,670
of complaints about uneven distribution

256
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,819
which i think is related to some of the

257
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:05,199
political issues around control of

258
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:07,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet addressing at this point but</font>

259
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:09,189
really this is only a only a huge

260
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,930
concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the resources to install</font>

261
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,550
these things are finite if there were

262
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,260
one single global budget that was

263
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:19,479
funding rich server installations then

264
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:22,660
this would look pretty unfair but if but

265
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,490
since growth in one area<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't prevent</font>

266
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,050
growth in another area that's probably

267
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,110
not really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concern that it looks</font>

268
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:31,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">like and the clusters in the bay area</font>

269
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,029
and the DC area do look kind of

270
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,720
excessive especially compared to how

271
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:39,639
sparsely distributed these things are in

272
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rest of the US but that does sort of</font>

273
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,720
match the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet topology in the</font>

274
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:46,599
US and the rest of the world's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hubbing</font>

275
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,310
around around those regions it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

276
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">me like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Western Europe's distribution</font>

277
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,359
which is far more<font color="#E5E5E5"> even so you know</font>

278
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much everywhere with significant</font>

279
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,880
population has has root servers very

280
00:12:56,439 --> 00:13:00,880
close by looks like it makes a lot more

281
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,759
sense and maybe the gold that should be

282
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:09,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">being shopped for is you know two per</font>

283
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:11,740
major city everywhere which seems like

284
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:15,310
the usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that internet you know</font>

285
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,630
infrastructure gets planned when when

286
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,569
being thought about carefully

287
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:25,660
and then moving on from that to

288
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:27,400
distribution of the TL DS so anybody

289
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,969
using the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs access to the</font>

290
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:35,620
rude it's a little less clear what you

291
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:38,430
know well what the the app you know what

292
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,930
the requirements are for individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds</font>

293
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,060
presumably what you need in a given area

294
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,689
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that dld is that are being used to</font>

295
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:49,119
address local resources so in most

296
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:52,540
places that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> local ccTLD and</font>

297
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,020
any other TLD<font color="#CCCCCC"> zin in common use so if</font>

298
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,370
somebody's if com for instance is being

299
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,050
used allowed in the region then it would

300
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">be useful to have comm service nearby</font>

301
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,420
but there's no real need to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> close</font>

302
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:07,540
access to TL DS that aren't being used

303
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,040
by anything you're likely to head and

304
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,689
trying to distribute everything

305
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,579
everywhere certainly wouldn't scale very

306
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:19,680
well so first of all looking at calm and

307
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:22,480
dot net it's very well connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

308
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,390
you know the big internet core region

309
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,480
the you know North<font color="#E5E5E5"> America Western</font>

310
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,800
Europe East Asia that are welcome you

311
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,910
know regions that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well</font>

312
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:36,069
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other and then the one</font>

313
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">non core location those got right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

314
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,980
think is is Sydney in Australia which is

315
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,740
you know still reasonably well connected

316
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:48,400
but not you know not<font color="#E5E5E5"> nearly as enmeshed</font>

317
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:52,930
as the rest of those areas so doing the

318
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:56,640
same map overlay that I did on the root

319
00:14:52,930 --> 00:15:00,670
servers assuming this comes up in loads

320
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,949
so do it over laying this on top of

321
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:06,880
fiber<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maps you end up with a a visible</font>

322
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:12,250
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a well served area that looks</font>

323
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,720
something like that and it was also

324
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,290
pointed up to me in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course of asking</font>

325
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,420
lots of questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that that</font>

326
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:23,349
serving some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these harder to reach</font>

327
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,599
areas with with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot-com zone would</font>

328
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,160
be you might be rather difficult because

329
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,140
of the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data involved in the</font>

330
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,069
updates there and if areas have very

331
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,150
slow links going

332
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:37,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">then it might be hard to replicate that</font>

333
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:39,040
and then looking at org and dad info and

334
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,250
co-op that<font color="#CCCCCC"> share the same set of servers</font>

335
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,770
this was harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get data on because</font>

336
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:47,170
ultra DNS who runs the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers considers</font>

337
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:51,550
this information to be confidential so

338
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:55,260
sorry so this involved you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know doing a</font>

339
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,260
lot more digging for information and I'm

340
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:07,240
and see and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm told I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm told i missed</font>

341
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:09,250
a bunch of them so so if there's if

342
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,560
there's locations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm missing here I I</font>

343
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:16,870
apologize and would be happy to to

344
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:19,380
accept corrections on that so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

345
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:24,700
like there's significantly fewer

346
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:28,750
locations then then verisign has 44

347
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,970
common net so in particular their public

348
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,630
location of the locations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could find</font>

349
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,150
only one each in Asia and Europe and

350
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:40,960
then but they do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> South Africa which</font>

351
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:46,180
is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much outside that well</font>

352
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:49,830
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> car I've also they also say</font>

353
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:53,079
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a bunch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of servers that are</font>

354
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:55,680
sitting right next to the caching

355
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,730
resolver<font color="#E5E5E5"> clusters that some big ISPs and</font>

356
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,099
again those are kind of unspecific

357
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:03,700
claims so don't know which is P is those

358
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,319
are and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> serve anyone who</font>

359
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,819
isn't using the caching resolvers of

360
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,438
those big ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's hard to measure</font>

361
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,329
the impact of those and whether they

362
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:14,439
increase this coverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> arias</font>

363
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:18,369
significantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there are you</font>

364
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole bunch of other gTLDs that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

365
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:22,839
didn't bother to you know didn't bother

366
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:26,740
to map but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for informational</font>

367
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:30,700
purposes locations where they're served

368
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:32,860
so again this seems to mostly be the the

369
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,840
same serving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the serving the</font>

370
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,740
well-connected core and not serving the

371
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,879
the poorly connected areas with these

372
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,850
though the one that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of</font>

373
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,480
strange on was was da dent which is the

374
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

375
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,510
national TLD used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think mostly</font>

376
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,700
international treaty organizations and

377
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,530
it's served from a very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

378
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,190
locations and doesn't actually look all

379
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:59,290
that international so there there is a

380
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,370
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where the where the gTLDs</font>

381
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:07,240
should be which is really more of a i

382
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:09,070
think a policy question then a<font color="#CCCCCC"> then a</font>

383
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,140
data-gathering question so kind of

384
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:15,879
beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scope of this so that you</font>

385
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:18,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if if it's okay for large questions</font>

386
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,960
the world to not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> using them and to be</font>

387
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,419
using their ccTLDs instead then it's

388
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,970
probably okay to not not serve them

389
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:27,100
locally in those parts of the world so

390
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,960
really this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for I can and</font>

391
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,709
for I suppose the marketing people at

392
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:36,549
the at the registries that are selling

393
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:42,400
those domains and then moving on from

394
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:43,660
that to distribution of the ccTLDs the

395
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,070
the answer to where those should work

396
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,179
seems a lot more straightforward they

397
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,450
should work in their own countries

398
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:51,790
second dairying them in the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font>

399
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,140
the core where it's easy for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of</font>

400
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,350
the world to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to them is also nice</font>

401
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:59,110
and putting them in other regions where

402
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:01,480
there's a lot of communications with the

403
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:06,790
region that uses that TLD would also

404
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:08,890
certainly speed up dns lookups so but

405
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,559
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it looks like</font>

406
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,720
just over two thirds of the ccTLDs are

407
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:17,320
actually hosted in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the countries</font>

408
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:20,380
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to be</font>

409
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,490
used in and again this is another map

410
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:27,520
that will probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a long time to</font>

411
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:30,460
load on on this laptop so the this X so

412
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,679
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those countries that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't host</font>

413
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,590
their own or small islands that aren't

414
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,290
showing up well on this but the the red

415
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,639
areas are the areas that don't the

416
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,710
countries that don't host their TLD

417
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,640
locally and the green ones are the the

418
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:49,059
countries that do so so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

419
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,860
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones you can't see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on here very</font>

420
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:52,629
well with it all are a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> South</font>

421
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pacific Islands and a bunch of Caribbean</font>

422
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,290
islands that are poorly enough connected

423
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,360
to the rest

424
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,770
the world that they're probably in real

425
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,699
danger of<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting cut off from the XTC</font>

426
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:05,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">tlds and then the same goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this big</font>

427
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,330
swath through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Africa those are pretty</font>

428
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,550
much all satellite connected regions

429
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:15,699
that have to go over satellite links to

430
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:19,090
get from local users to their ccTLDs and

431
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:22,390
then there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a bunch of ccTLDs</font>

432
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,220
that are not slit their 18 of them that

433
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,080
are not slaved in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car meaning that</font>

434
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:30,070
if their regions get cut off from the

435

so the the list of / 24 is that contain
