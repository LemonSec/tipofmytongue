3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,410
viewing a panel discussion on ipv6

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,740
entitled time for transition or just

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,320
more gossip for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who are unfamiliar</font>

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:19,619
gosip was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> weazy I guess the early</font>

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,390
90s government initiative towards using

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,090
OSI networking everywhere in the

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,910
government which was very successful

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:30,109
anyway so we have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting crowd</font>

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,399
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us today we have five panelists oh</font>

12
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:37,440
these are folks who come from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mixture</font>

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,059
of ipv6 boosters and ipv6 skeptics<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,589
four major carriers and also we have a

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,930
representative today from a major

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,070
government contractor and some of you

guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are saying well you know the</font>

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,820
federal<font color="#E5E5E5"> government spawn ipv6 why didn't</font>

19
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,200
we get a federal government guy well the

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,809
reason is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very hard to get</font>

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">any actual factual stuff out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

22
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,839
government folks government contractor

23
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,940
folks on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand are much more</font>

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,300
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually talk and give us</font>

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,289
information so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the session</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,910
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work the way the floor mats</font>

27
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,260
going to be is we're gonna start with

28
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,850
some introductions from all the folks up

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,770
here then we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

30
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,839
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have prepared there's</font>

31
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,970
not to be any real formal presentations

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,030
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 1 slider so from each person and</font>

33
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,320
then you know mixed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some of the</font>

34
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,060
questions i've already got prepared

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,309
we're also going to open up some

36
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,320
questions to the microphones around the

37
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,780
room and so folks and go up and and rock

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mic as it were and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as some of</font>

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,750
the hard questions if you guys hear

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,280
things up here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't agree with you</font>

41
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,570
know definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge it you don't</font>

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,490
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold your questions till the end</font>

43
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,008
we'll be cutting two questions hopefully

44
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,839
fairly early in the presentation so with

45
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,780
no further ado let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me start out by</font>

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,420
introducing Joe<font color="#E5E5E5"> who'll if I'm</font>

47
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,380
pronouncing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that properly with AT&T joke</font>

48
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,360
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you care to introduce yourself</font>

49
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,579
again i'm joe pool with AT&T I'm

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,710
responsible for some emerging services

51
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,600
for ATT across our layer 2 and layer 3

52
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,630
services and for internet and private

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,149
networking and ipv6 clearly falls into

54
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,399
that category and again there's some

55
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">great questions coming up so I won't be</font>

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,180
late I won't focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> nose but just some</font>

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,270
starting points again it was a question

58
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,900
is are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we pro or con and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've categorize</font>

59
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,390
myself as pragmatically pro so

60
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,760
you'll hear some of that coming through

61
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,920
but let me real quickly why ipv6 why now

62
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,040
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I got three drivers here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

63
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,048
personal one why aware make<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe I'm</font>

64
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,640
a government person for a moment I do

65
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:27,680
believe we are running out of ipv4

66
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,720
addresses I don't think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a myth I</font>

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,659
do believe we're running out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those in</font>

68
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,760
addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do believe Nats</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and non</font>

69
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:36,548
unique addresses are making it hard for

70
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,929
us as service providers to offer

71
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,790
services over IP or everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> over IP</font>

72
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,349
or whatever we end up wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

73
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,450
that that converged IP network is going

74
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:45,888
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to build with</font>

75
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,500
these non unique addresses that are

76
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:50,569
surviving here in ipv4 and gnats are

77
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,000
facilitating that environment and then

78
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:55,280
finally why the government I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,840
US government would what would love to

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,430
see ipv6 take off because I think

81
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're a little afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the haves and</font>

82
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,750
have-nots and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. is traditionally</font>

83
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,810
on the half side of the haves and

84
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,909
have-nots and I think ipv6 may be one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

85
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,099
those things that might enable the haves

86
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:12,138
to do something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have is not</font>

87
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,209
can't and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not used to being on the</font>

88
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:16,010
have nots side of that divide so I think

89
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're trying to do first some low</font>

90
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:21,530
hurdle things to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to facilitate us to</font>

91
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,359
be on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> half side of that divide thank</font>

92
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,430
you Dan<font color="#E5E5E5"> great our next speaker is going</font>

Americo there was some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff at the end</font>

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the year where we split it where we</font>

98
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">split the we basically operate the</font>

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:46,459
global backbone for ntt communications

100
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:49,430
under the name NTT America we presently

101
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:51,109
are doing I pv6 native<font color="#E5E5E5"> across our</font>

102
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,870
network and we have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it for a</font>

103
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:57,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">while and here to answer questions</font>

104
00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:01,609
people have on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff and generally</font>

105
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:04,129
pro ipv6 because it it's there it's cool

106
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:09,760
it works and we derive some extra money

107
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:11,810
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay now that we know v6 is cool</font>

108
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,608
our next speaker is going to be West

109
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:18,858
George from sprint hi I'm West George

110
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:21,620
with Sprint's IP engineering group i'm

111
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:25,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">wearing my Rob Raquel hat he couldn't be</font>

112
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:28,760
here because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> weather so basically</font>

113
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,440
i would say that we're we're basically

114
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,500
pro v6 but we're still looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

115
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,620
skeptically partially because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

116
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,710
you're seeing here<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the k'da</font>

117
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">skidder grab for ipv6 shows we're pretty</font>

118
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:45,169
close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> center of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipv6 world as</font>

119
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">far as routes are concerned but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

120
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,340
can see a snapshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one of our</font>

121
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:54,290
interfaces there's pretty much just ping

122
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:56,539
traffic going across<font color="#E5E5E5"> still and but the</font>

123
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,100
the thing thing is that it's starting to

124
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:02,030
become a little more of an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

125
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,250
of the amount of visibility that's

126
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:09,380
getting within the government I actually

127
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:12,950
participated in a an ipv6 summit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

128
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:19,070
the government had in in reston in

129
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:21,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">December where the general general feel</font>

130
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,280
is that ipv6 is going to save the world

131
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,650
rainbows and puppy dogs for everyone you

132
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,349
know everything works we just turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

133
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:36,950
and it happens this is being sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

134
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,930
continued on because vendors people like

135
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,250
Microsoft the networking vendors are all

136
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,110
saying yeah we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready whenever you are</font>

137
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,740
just install our software turn it on and

138
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll all work beautifully when you</font>

139
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,360
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the overall</font>

140
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,530
implementation of it yeah at least this

141
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,740
time the government's willing to spend

142
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,239
some money on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it unlike but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hold on are</font>

143
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,740
using the vendor marketing people aren't

144

being completely truthful oh yeah sorry

145
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:10,160
go go it could be it's once once the the

146
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,620
implementation catches up with the

147
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,660
marketing there's some there's some good

148
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,740
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen here in terms of</font>

149
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,810
what the government wants what they're

150
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,520
expecting you know a lot of it is that

151
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,200
they don't know what they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet but</font>

152
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,849
they know they want it and they know

153
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">they want it soon and they're kind of</font>

171
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,560
the core day one there's going to be a

172
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,960
few access methods as well as support

173
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,029
for mail and dns and our initial

174
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,878
footprint is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited to our</font>

00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:31,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">6 PT capable devices and have some</font>

limited ID back-end throughout the year

177
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:37,089
we expect to evolve the service add

178
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:40,029
additional 60 devices on the edge

179
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:43,060
whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> through equipment refresh</font>

180
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:44,349
with 60 e capable devices or whether

181
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,669
that's through upgrading existing

182
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:51,219
devices because of demand for b6 we're

183
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,229
also going to increase the IT support to

184
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:55,899
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully supported and have a</font>

185
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:57,639
comprehensive product offering and then

186
00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:00,009
early next year our plan is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do v6</font>

187
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,870
native in the core basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

188
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,539
philosophy when it comes to v6 is that

189
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,610
it's important people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably going</font>

190
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:09,128
to be using it in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> but right</font>

191
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,710
now the demand is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very high it's not</font>

192
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,180
generating a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of revenue we don't</font>

193
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,659
want to spend a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money on it we</font>

194
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:21,370
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a just-in-time network</font>

195
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:22,539
then why put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the court the the</font>

196
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why we didn't go straight into</font>

197
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:26,919
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core was certification issues but</font>

198
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I guess my question is if</font>

199
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,909
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of demand why and it's</font>

200
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,709
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new why are you guys you know</font>

201
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:35,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">in 2007 going to make it the core of</font>

202
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:37,989
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea here</font>

203
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,890
is that at some point there's going to

204
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:43,870
be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wide scale migration to ipv6 and in</font>

205
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,350
order to do that easily in order to have

206
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,020
an easy transition from v42 v6 you want

207
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:53,610
to have a v4 and v6

208
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:55,410
which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent great and thank you</font>

here in nanog to get representatives

212
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,449
from large enterprises fred is also

carriers so if your sprint or AT&T we

220
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,839
probably put part of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

221
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,430
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I have kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

222
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,800
interesting perspective not only from

223
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,750
that standpoint government contractors

224
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,120
or government clients are important to

225
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,740
us but beyond that one thing you'll see

226
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,580
on the slide up here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we're</font>

227
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,740
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the non-traditional</font>

228
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:43,110
transport of IP services and what we see

229
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,770
in industry outside of the office

230
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,750
building it's a large change shift from

231
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,300
traditional plant automation building

232
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,420
automation process automation networks

233
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,459
from proprietary protocols over to IP so

234
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,010
when we start taking a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at IP</font>

235
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,980
address allocation security and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2n</font>

236
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,990
security for things such as the remote

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,240
control room for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nuclear power plant</font>

238
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,460
things of this nature there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

239
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attractive to to us</font>

240
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,950
in the area of b6 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beckles internal</font>

241

deployment that started last year on an

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,970
enterprise basis and this is going to

243
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,400
hit 40,000 people is geared to build a

244
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,930
competence within the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one</font>

245
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,720
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've noticed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the lack of</font>

246
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,209
maturity and some some products but

247
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,340
they're coming and coming along

248
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:31,680
relatively quickly so the demand may not

249
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,900
be there yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's kind of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chicken</font>

in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> egg if we go back to nineteen</font>

255

where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are with the networks so I look</font>

256
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,010
at this from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standpoint of</font>

257
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:56,040
competition where can Beck will compete

258
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,750
more aggressively around the world where

259
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,189
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we demonstrate leadership and</font>

260
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,380
hopefully

261
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:04,340
here some ipv6 leadership out of my

262
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:08,240
colleagues up here today<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

263
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:11,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">very much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and my name is Daniel</font>

264
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Goulding i'll be your host today so</font>

265
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,990
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump right into the questions now</font>

266
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,720
we'll keep this as interesting as

267
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,920
possible okay so our first question the

268
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,840
way I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this is we'll just</font>

269
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,530
sort of throw some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these out there</font>

270
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,080
for folks can have people names up there

271
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,839
so you can remember who everyone is so

272
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,580
let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask this question to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel</font>

273
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,020
why I fit for you guys for you guys who

274
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,510
were carriers for enterprises whatever

275
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,610
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I p6 and why now I'm you guys have</font>

276
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,920
kind of answered this but but I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

277
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,960
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> where specifically is why are</font>

278
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,020
you implementing v6 other than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

279
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,000
it's sort of cool to do is it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

280
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,770
address exhaustion you know you fear

281
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,710
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will soon run out of addresses</font>

282
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:54,199
is it new capabilities is it vendors

283
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:57,770
pushing new hardware is it federal

288
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:14,300
went and we did our rollout in 2003 was

289
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,280
we had essentially a combination of

290
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,030
factors including internal customer

here we face the challenges in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

300
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:52,939
have Japan as one of the leading ipv6

301
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,800
market adopters and since we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big</font>

302
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,510
player within that market space we

303
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,699
needed to do that for for that specific

reason combined<font color="#E5E5E5"> with government mandates</font>

305
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,470
and such there but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much of that</font>

306
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,270
is is political<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jared because if you</font>

307
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at you know Japan being one of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">into a government office and you look at</font>

311
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,760
IP stack is on the average workstation

312
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,610
for the most part it's going to be ipv4

313
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,700
I mean there really isn't that much

314
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,660
Japanese ipv6 adoption is it more

315
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,360
playing nice with the Japanese

316
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,949
government's well it's it's because you

317
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,950
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cater to the specific business</font>

318
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,090
markets if you look at why for example

319
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,050
and I'm not intending to pick on them

320
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,080
because I didn't learn them in advance

321
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:37,150
but why for example an AT&T or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sprint</font>

322
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,890
might want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and roll out their v6</font>

323
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,340
services perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's because they</font>

324
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,449
have large government contracts where

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,160
they're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> preferred carries of choice</font>

326
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> same could be the case for mci or</font>

327

any other carrier and as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

328
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,470
goes it also puts us in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> position to be</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> global leader you might be able to</font>

332
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,230
of the v6 core and III think we've

333
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">really put down a flag and say that this</font>

336
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,480
it's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sort of a technical cool</font>

337
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,030
thing of saying look it's here it works

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,640
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not a problem we've</font>

366
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,550
propagate all throughout the ipv4

often a common box that gives you what

you're really looking forward is to a

security and then what what what we are

391
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,819
hearing is we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got these enterprises</font>

who have their VPNs but they want to be

the end devices have common addresses

yeah and and i would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to chime in on</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're still getting infected</font>

427
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,600
behind these systems anyways and its

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,539
people are essentially miss using and

429
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,459
abusing the technology so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

think they should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to have it</font>

431
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:40,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">III think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that some people certainly</font>

432
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,570
should not be using technology in the

way they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I if they have the money to</font>

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:50,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">buy it and abuse it that's that's there</font>

435
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:52,240
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do but so so essentially your</font>

436
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,559
position is that your enterprise

437
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,799
customer shouldn't be allowed to use

438
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,690
network address translation some of them

439
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,899
misuse it they would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do stuff</font>

440
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:04,179
like be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have their voices Rome</font>

441
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:05,529

their corporate network or something

443
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:09,520
else and they put these firewall boxes

444
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,990
in the way and you end up punching holes

445
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,840
in them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all sorts of</font>

446
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:16,419
complicated things and once we if we see

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,070
some global ipv6 system what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">stop somebody from setting up and say oh</font>

well to be compliant with this stuff

450
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,710
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need to put in your v6</font>

454
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:34,178
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say on that is a type of firewall</font>

455
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,850
right and go and implement that as a

456
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,169
solution when Elsa<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so a solution</font>

457
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,490
but not the right which is to push back

458
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:40,870
here most of the folks who are doing net

459

aren't doing it because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't get</font>

networks your big customers for the most

467
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:01,480
part these guys have as many addresses

necessarily a misuse but they put

474
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,260
themselves in a position where they

475
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:20,408
limit themselves in the future okay also

using real routable addresses and not

errands well actually that's not any

483

part of any air in regulation Erin

484

actually makes no statements about route

485
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:39,309
ability at all they make statements

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> host count and and stuff like that</font>

like like Joe said security not from the

531
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:40,330
IP address space but the appropriate

532
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:42,760
security mechanisms over ok so now other

533
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,580
than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are don't like</font>

534
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:48,520
mad and we get that other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that what</font>

535
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,409
is ipv6 get us other than longer address

536
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,060
space because there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

537
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:55,450
claims made in this area and hand

538
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:57,790
security enhance quality it does your

539
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,000
dishes for you it turns the world into a

540
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,409
bed

541
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,990
place any thoughts that I believe you're

542
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:10,900
right the only thing it gives us is more

543
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:14,500
bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Jason chillin verizon business</font>

544
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:18,520
unit the other thing that it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives</font>

545
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,140
us is an IP stack that's young that

546
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:25,870
people seem to think it's easy to get

547
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:28,690
modifications into this is that good um

548
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:32,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot allows for new features presumably</font>

549
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:34,660
like nobility referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> rich which you</font>

550
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,490
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> theoretically do envy for it just</font>

551
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't seem like people want to go</font>

552
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,720
through the trouble of changing stack

553
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,130
saying I ipv6 sort of is written<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

554
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">know of course it's a work in pride in</font>

555
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,660
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is written do you</font>

556
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,160
guys see anything else other than longer

557
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,190
address yeah something I'm looking

558
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward to is that is standardization on</font>

559
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,970
how to use that flow label field I mean

560
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,429
it's written in space there it's got so

561
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,830
much potential for again bringing value

562
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,530
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the IP network being able to</font>

563
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">use something beyond the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> diffserv</font>

564
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,250
kind of model for being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to have</font>

565
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,600
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware networking I think</font>

566
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,790
the flow label has a lot of opportunity

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,530
it is now I mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't really compare</font>

now we have to

you know right now it's 2006 we have to

compare ipv4 with all of its add-ons

602
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:34,549
simplification and that's that's

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,350
important to a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customers can i</font>

633
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,039
and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of discussions on this</font>

on the air<font color="#CCCCCC"> in public policy mailing list</font>

the proposed solutions which is shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the general agreement was</font>

that we didn't like is a group now right

640
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,950
now I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might be able to agree</font>

641
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,199
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you guys will disagree with me</font>

642
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,669
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enterprise multi-homing is sort of</font>

643
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,370
a customer requirement that people are

00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:16,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">not willing to give this up provider</font>

648
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,870
given that where do we go how do we

649
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,190
implement v6 and anything other than a

650
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,719
a government sort of paradigm where

651
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,150
government can get the v6 space they

652
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:33,200
want Google and Yahoo can get the v6

653
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:35,030
space they want but you know number 78

654
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,920
on the fortune 500 list maybe you can't

655
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:40,960
get the v's the provider in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pit of v6</font>

656
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,960
space we want what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean for us</font>

657
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:46,870
I'll go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think kind</font>

00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have here is that</font>

00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:55,880

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,120
works right now and it may not be the

664
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,800
the best implementation of dual homing

665
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,840
but the idea is is you get multiple

666
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,669
addresses you will get a dress from each

667
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,470
of your providers you get 25 providers

668
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,300
you get five blocks of addresses you can

669
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do as you want and the edge</font>

I'm we all know a shrimp six works that

674
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,160
the question is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you know the</font>

675
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,100
last night I go is pretty clear that

676
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,450
most folks think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very bad it's a</font>

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,830
very bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for the internet and it's</font>

something that requires every host

operating system the wrong to be

680
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,100
rewritten and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something that that</font>

681
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,140
will in all likelihood never happen

682
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,980
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> those things and enterprises</font>

683
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,440
aren't too crazy about it either

684
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,910
certainly hosting folks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo they</font>

overwhelmingly where do we go from there

691
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,850
for enterprise multihull well I'm

692
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,380
surprised we as an operator group is not

693
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,230
more concerned about fragmentation of

<font color="#E5E5E5">think with the with the growth of a s</font>

have to continue to upgrade our routers

705
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,550
and router memory and such but I'm not

706
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,290
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a path other than that right</font>

707
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:33,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">now and it doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be any</font>

708
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:35,850
different in the ipv6 space it's it's

709
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,090
the potential for and explode

710
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,889
and yes we've had some some growth it's

711
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,320
been managed growth higher than linear

712
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:46,049
growth but there's a potential for an

713
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,639
explosion which scares scares me quite a

714
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:50,820
bit but what's what's the driver for an

715
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,350
explosion is is that it could happen I

716
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are we advertising now that's</font>

717
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,740
the potential but right yes and somebody

718
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,709
somebody could d aggregate the entire

719
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet today right and take down a lot</font>

what did we<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree to what a / 24 right</font>

722
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,690
we won't listen to anything what long

723
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,210
this lasts 24 what what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> that end</font>

724
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,100
up being<font color="#CCCCCC"> in ipv6 and how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

could there be up there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect that</font>

726
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,600
would be a / 48 ok so how what's the

727
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">order of magnitude</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more / 48 that will</font>

728
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,689
be out there than / 20 but here's the

729
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,110
thing if we decorated the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to /</font>

730
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:24,150

00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,929
to have some measure of fragmentation

00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,880
right now in the v4 world and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

and got our ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> base and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what one thing</font>

787
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:59,010
that we do when we construct a facility

788
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:01,110
is it's a turnkey facilities such as a

power plant or an airport or something

790

<font color="#CCCCCC">like this when the facility is complete</font>

791
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,140
we'll turn it over to the owner

792
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:10,440
including all the network stuff so we're

793

operating from the standpoint honor on

00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:31,409
not everyone fits fits into that mode

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but I do think we need to face the</font>

801
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:37,290
fact that enterprises that are dealing

with dozens of service providers around

803
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:41,399
the planet have it internally to have

some way to manage the network as a

<font color="#E5E5E5">could we have than 24 s that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

812
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,090
possible if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at V for unicast</font>

813
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,240
rattles

814
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:07,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">base there's just over 16 million / 24 s</font>

815
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,059
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think forty eight is the number</font>

816
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:19,039
that we would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to da greh gate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

817
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:22,549
there's over 137 billion addresses so i

818
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:26,658
mean we're looking at two million times

819
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:30,049
potentially more 48s than we have 24 s

820
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:31,970
and let me point out that if you're

821
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,080
assigning a flash 48 to your end user

822
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,429
and they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some traffic</font>

823
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,049
engineering capabilities then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

824
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:39,950
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to decorate to something</font>

825
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:41,720
more specific or shorter than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

826
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,880
so what is your opinion on what is

827
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,580
verizon businesses opinion on the

830
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:57,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question the first is the Tony hain</font>

831
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:59,779
response which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi humming and v6</font>

832
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:03,770
just works d aggregate the routers will

833
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:06,140
keep up I'm not convinced that that's

834
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:09,168
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case I'm concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about routing</font>

835
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,820
table size the other way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer this</font>

836
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:13,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is to say well let's figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

837
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:16,070
a way to do this without d aggregating

838
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,629
let's look at gym six let's solve the

839
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,419
provider independent problem without the

840
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:22,368
aggregation and unfortunately I don't

841
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:26,210
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I TF is moving in a direction that</font>

842
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:28,730
gives the right capabilities to transit

843
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,290
asses or to business customers that want

844
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:33,679
to do their traffic engineering at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

845
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:36,199
network level so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need another</font>

846
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,619
solution is really my answer Wes any

847
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,618
thoughts on that

848
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,790
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the biggest issue</font>

849
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,970
right now is that it is broken you know

850
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:52,550
the memory is reasonably cheap

851
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:55,040
comparatively the prop the problem we

852
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,350
have right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is that the tcam memory</font>

853
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,400
no just remember Ian Jenn<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

854
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem you have right now is that you</font>

855
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,150
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other sorts of memory like</font>

856
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,950
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> t</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cam and and then you have things</font>

857
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">like ASIC design and some of the design</font>

858
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:09,220
assumptions the vendors are using its

859
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,839
kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> equivalent of putting</font>

860
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,029
putting together a layout that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is based</font>

861
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:17,180
on no aggregation like a classful

862
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,650
network in ipv4 and then having<font color="#CCCCCC"> it start</font>

863
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,390
d aggregating and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your assumptions</font>

864
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,000
are all wrong you put your<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast path</font>

865
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:26,450
stops working and you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> having much</font>

866
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,730
larger problems than just the simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

867
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:31,720
need 10 gigs of memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every router</font>

868
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,720
in order to handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing table</font>

869
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:37,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your opinion and what</font>

870
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:39,830
is sprint's opinion on v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming</font>

871
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:44,470
for enterprises well right now we're

872
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:49,720
we're we're adhering pretty carefully to

873
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:49,720
the IRC that Rob wrote a while ago on

874
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:01,319
about strict strict strictly announcing

875
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:05,059
the talent the top top aggregation and

876
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:08,579
nothing more mm-hmm and at this point

877
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:11,640
which eliminates even PA multihoming

878
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:12,749
right and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

879
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,788
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of a way to prove that it's</font>

880
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:17,669
broken I mean there isn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

881
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:20,039
solution right now so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think most</font>

882
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:24,029
providers will adhere to the idea of not

883
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:25,710
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> PA multihoming for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> v6 I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean do</font>

884
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:28,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think most providers will just see</font>

885
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:31,249
advertised we clarify it you don't mean

886
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,289
multihoming you mean multi advertising

887
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:36,749
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> IIIi think we all know is a group</font>

888
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:38,849
would you know multihoming means by

889
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:40,140
let's BK there's a lot of implementation

890
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:41,880
potential implementations from

891
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,710
multihoming the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're talking</font>

892
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,789
about here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is multi advertising sure</font>

893
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:50,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but okay well given that do you</font>

894
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:52,650
think it's likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most service</font>

895
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:57,329
providers will only advertise you know

896
00:36:52,650 --> 00:37:00,089
fully you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know essentially no summary</font>

897
00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:02,219
aggregates of v6 space or do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

898
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:05,400
they will leak more specific routes for

899
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:06,630
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers and be sense where do</font>

900
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,519
you always policies on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just</font>

901
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:13,769
curious so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to separate two</font>

902
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,328
things there's there's what I believe

903
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:18,899
should be done and then there's what I

904
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:22,999
have seen us do so far in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this v6 space</font>

905
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:25,289
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that people should and</font>

906
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:28,049
wearing my personal hat<font color="#E5E5E5"> I encourage</font>

907
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:29,940
people to do what a lot of other people

908
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:32,759
do which is filter on the IRA our

909
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,339
boundaries you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody is</font>

910
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:39,089
allocated in the and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin says they only</font>

911
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:41,969
allocate 48s out of a block I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

912
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:44,160
it's wise for people to go and do that

913
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:46,979
and filter and say I will only accept

914
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,779
prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> links up to 48 so not necessarily</font>

915
00:37:46,979 --> 00:37:51,058
<font color="#CCCCCC">the RA our boundary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that specific</font>

916
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:53,999
block but the the minimum ar ar

917
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:57,180
allocation limit yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in other</font>

918
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:58,558
words a provider could get a / 32 and be

919
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,440
giving out chunks of that and you'd

920
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:05,190
accept a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a leak / 48 in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> personal</font>

921
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,569
opinion uh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I and and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> based</font>

922
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,829
based on that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty</font>

923
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:08,410
reasonable a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done</font>

924
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:11,920
that

925
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:14,250
for space and the what can be done to go

926
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,200
in mirror that policy as bestest policy

927
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:19,900
possible I i think is wise and sound

928
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,390
technically to be done what i have seen

929
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,700
happen is i have seen customers come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

930
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:27,490
us and pressure us and say i want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

931
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:34,240
able to advertise my 64 or something

932
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:35,859
else and I that's a no and and and we

933
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,069
spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time turning on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

934
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:41,230
internally and I I think that we

935
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:42,670
eventually gave in to the customer but

936
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:46,680
that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that everyone else</font>

937
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:49,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">should accept the route from us got it</font>

938
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh what about the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

939
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:54,879
what about verizon business which your

940
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:56,500
your point of view on allowing these

941
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,580
sort of advertisements because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

942
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,980
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think much sooner</font>

943
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,560
than later well right now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

944
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:05,050
taking our cue<font color="#CCCCCC"> from what's recommended</font>

945
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,320
an ietf and<font color="#CCCCCC"> erin and that seems to be</font>

946
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:12,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that aggregation is the holy grail so</font>

947
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,290
we're only advertising<font color="#E5E5E5"> our aggregate we</font>

948
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,840
allow customers to advertise to us

949
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:19,300
whatever they want with inside their

950
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,700
space more specifics but to the global

951
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,760
Internet routing table we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

952
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:27,790
advertising<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aggregates that's our</font>

953
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,610
policy at the moment if provider

954
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,930
independent space goes through and

955
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:34,480
people start listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to or people</font>

956
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:36,730
start putting / 48 sin to the global

957
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet round table then that's</font>

958
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:42,700
probably an indication that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregation</font>

959
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:45,000
is not the Holy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grail and it probably</font>

960
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:48,910
sets a precedent for<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,330
read the first part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what Jason said</font>

I'm but I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried about the</font>

965
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,350
of do what the marketplace requires you

966
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,970
to do this on you know I'm kind of on

971
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:11,950
there's a brick wall there will not be a

00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,640
anywhere you know I'd like my colleagues

00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:42,609
by a single provider or or by all these

985
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,320
guys at once it's not manageable from a

986
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,450
corporate standpoint so how do you guys

987
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,360
fix my problem and just to back Fred up

988
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:51,118
I I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear that from I 400 you know</font>

989
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,920
really really big enterprise customers

990
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,100
global 2000 they all say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

991
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,480
no one is with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea that a no</font>

992
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:06,940
provider independent source doesn't say

993
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:08,200
that is my deal breaker for v6 honestly

994
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably one of those</font>

995
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:15,279
things that is going to drive more

996
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:18,700
adoption within the VPN area of the

997
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,050
universe the private network stuff that

998
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,490
doesn't connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big I internet</font>

999
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:26,830
for purposes of you know whatever

1000
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:29,080
whatever test networks want need to be

1001
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:33,210
whatever the government believes<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1002
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:37,690
going to get see its benefit from ipv6

1003
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:40,150
there's less<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a driver to go there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1004
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:44,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the regular ipv4 world other than some</font>

1005
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:45,790
general but around well if all these

1006
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:47,109
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries are building their IP</font>

1007
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,820
networks from scratch right now why

1008
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:50,380
wouldn't they go straight to ipv6 and we

1009
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,750
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get left behind kind of</font>

1010
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:56,320
thing and that's what they're saying to

1011
00:41:51,750 --> 00:42:02,530
right so any other thoughts here on you

1012
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:05,950
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enterprise angle it I kind</font>

1013
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:09,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it doesn't sound quite right but is</font>

1014
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:11,169
is it nanog problem it's I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

1015
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,420
plumbing problem and we're a bunch of

1016
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:15,550
carpenters we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the right tools</font>

1017
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,170
to fix the plumbing it's a plumbing

1018
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,660
problem so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying this is the I</font>

1019
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">etfs problem I kind of alluding to that</font>

1020
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,799
yet well yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think clearly it's the</font>

1021
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:26,590
IES problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think the issue is the</font>

1022
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,270
IETF is has given us a saw when we need

1023
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,400
a hammer or something like that I mean

1024
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,840
it's right tool for the right job if

1025
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,820
they don't give you the right tool

1026
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,079
you've got a you got to push back so

1027
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,119
again are you saying more opera

1028
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:39,579
should go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF and get involved</font>

1029
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,459
and get the right tools yet you know I I

1030
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:45,219
think in in my perfect never land where

1031
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:46,899
ipv6 you know gives us bunnies and stuff

1032
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:48,670
I think a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that would happen</font>

1033
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,319
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in the real world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a lot</font>

1034
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">of operators have trouble seeing the ROI</font>

1035
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,849
and sending a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the ITF</font>

1036
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:56,769
where's vendors have a very clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> ROI</font>

1037
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:58,779
and going to the IETF I think it would

1038
00:42:56,769 --> 00:43:00,218
<font color="#CCCCCC">be great and I think of the I I think</font>

1039
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:02,319
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> better thing would be for the IETF</font>

1040
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:03,459
to be aggressively coming just forms

1041
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,529
like this like they did at the last

1042
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:07,660
nanog but much earlier in the process

1043
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:09,549
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements gathering it's not</font>

1044
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,469
important that operators go and actually

1045
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:12,849
make the solutions but operators need to

1046
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:14,380
be making<font color="#CCCCCC"> the requirements and I don't</font>

1047
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:16,869
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what's happening now so</font>

1048
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,519
getting a useful ipv6 protocol that

1049
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:20,200
supports multihoming is not a good

1050
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:22,689
return on an investment for sending two

1051
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,640
people died EDF I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

1052
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:26,769
that it is personally but but but I i

1053
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,089
think you know and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that that's</font>

1054
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:30,459
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to change what operators are</font>

1055
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:33,430
doing to that for all but the very

1056
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:36,819
largest operators I mean our margins are

1057
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:38,709
small but on that note let me open this

1058
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:40,749
up to questions anyone anyone have any

1059
00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:44,229
nice soft balls they want to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1060

the panelists no all right here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1061
00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:52,058
line up boys ladies let's say please say

1062
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,459
your name and affiliation if any and all

1063
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:58,269
so which victim you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> caring to target</font>

1064

if any if not all you know star is an

1067
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:13,449
look in my routing table and I don't see

16.7 million routes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect you know</font>

1073
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:31,449
something like shim<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 that means I get</font>

1074
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:34,209
to carry a lot more state in my hosts

1075
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:36,549
and as a you know part of my network

1076
00:44:34,209 --> 00:44:38,499
operation is that is the thousands of

1077
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:42,699
pcs that we used to serve all that data

1078

to our end users so you know we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

1083
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,680
might actually prefer to carry it like

1084
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:57,950
in a smaller number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> machines than a</font>

00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">university so I assume that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

involved with I to and things of that

1089
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:10,130
nature so talk a little bit about your

1090
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:12,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">eye to experience with v6 well we get</font>

1091
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:14,270
our v6 address block from them so

1092
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately we don't have anything to</font>

1093
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:21,200
multi home with so that is an

1094
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:23,540
interesting ipv6 experience right there

1095
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,240
so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming important for the</font>

1096
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:29,330
enter for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> university it certainly is</font>

1097
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:34,009
in the v4 space<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if you think</font>

1098
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:36,049
about it we have three up screams so yes

1099
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:37,790
are you guys prepared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace all</font>

1100
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:41,690
your host operating systems or upgrade

1101
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:44,570
them to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> shim six at present there's</font>

1102
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:48,710
no sim<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tag for us an upgrade to so</font>

1103
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:51,380
it's certainly I am a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> on guard</font>

1104
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:54,530
yes Joel to answer the first part of

1105
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:56,750
your question in terms of concerns about

1106
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:58,240
the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the routing table I just</font>

1107
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:01,520
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to crunch a couple quick numbers</font>

1108
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:05,450
we're looking at it over 170 k internet

1109
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:08,420
routes you add to that another 50 to 150

1110
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:10,339
k internal v4 routes you're really

1111
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:14,210
easily in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the neighborhood of 300 k</font>

1112
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:17,390
routes for your v4 table you add to that

1113
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:19,190
what the v6 table could be if you make

1114
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,480
an assumption that every autonomous

1115
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,910
system is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to advertise one</font>

1116
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,830
aggregate and they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise</font>

1117
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:27,109
the aggregates based on what we see in

1118
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:30,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current v4 table assuming everyone's</font>

1119
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:32,540
doing dual stack you're looking at 21

1120
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:35,990
Kas is so that's another 21 k v6

1121
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:38,120
aggregates about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 k intentional d</font>

1122
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:40,129
aggregates in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> V force base so if you</font>

1126
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:48,980
of the there are some additional routes

1127
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:51,020
in the v4 table because people can't get

1128
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,970
large enough single blocks right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1129
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:56,330
so what I'm looking at basically is the

1130
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:58,399
designer report if we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 176 k</font>

1131
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,098

00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,789
aggregated

1133
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:05,099
2 117 k that would indicate that there's

1134
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:08,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">59 k intentional d aggregates happening</font>

1135
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:12,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you take that 59</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> k you add that</font>

1142
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:37,349

1143
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:43,859
your jerk I mean youryour well over 500

<font color="#E5E5E5">that are actually putting pressure on my</font>

1151
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:05,419
fib I don't think v6 is actually the one

1152
00:48:03,869 --> 00:48:09,289
that's hurting me the most at the moment

1153
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:12,359
but obviously you know we can point to

1154
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:14,819
how much it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hurt immediately</font>

had its own ipv6 space and got the

1171
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:03,848
answer yes and there are a few other

1172
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:07,029
large enterprises in the Aaron region

1173
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:08,829
that have their own ipv6 space what I

1174
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:13,299
want to point out to the audience of

1175
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:17,589
network operators is that the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

1176
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:20,410
to get ipv6 space in the urn region is

1177
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:22,509
to assert that you are an ISP an assert

1178
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:26,379
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a large number</font>

1179
00:49:22,509 --> 00:49:28,119
of ipv6 customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> imminently and if you</font>

1180
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:31,839
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this should not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the only</font>

1181
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:35,109
way to get ipv6 space and you'd like the

1182
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:38,578
Aaron policies to reflect reality and

1183
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:41,469
not force people to make perhaps

1184
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunate mischaracterizations of</font>

1185
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:45,509
their organizations and plans but isn't

1186
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:48,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a tradition when dealing with Aaron</font>

1187
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:51,819
hmm then you might want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to participate</font>

1188
00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:56,529
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Aaron policy process and help us</font>

1189
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:59,190
get an end user or an insight v6 policy

1190
00:49:56,529 --> 00:50:01,269
in place so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that things will match up</font>

1191
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,400
boy that could actually eliminate like

1192
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:04,959
the traditional annual you know offering

1193
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:11,969
up with allies<font color="#E5E5E5"> Darren or something you</font>

1196
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:20,200
response please yeah we struggled with

1197
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:22,479
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got our Erin allocation we</font>

00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,098
struggled<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the number of our IRS we</font>

1199
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:26,348
would have to deal with we struggle with

<font color="#E5E5E5">our business model where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually</font>

00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:31,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave network space behind to our</font>

1202
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,160
customer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figured the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only way</font>

1203
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:35,469
that we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get our job done</font>

1204
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:40,019
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sustainable basis was to get our</font>

1205
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:43,690
own allocation so I'm a proponent of of

1206
00:50:40,019 --> 00:50:46,538
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the aaron and other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rir</font>

1207
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:49,029
policies reflect what really needs to be

1208
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:52,690
done but in our case it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was done just</font>

1209
00:50:49,029 --> 00:50:54,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">because we have to act as is p well yeah</font>

1210
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:56,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it's reasonable to act in your</font>

1211
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:58,720
your corporations own best interest i

1212
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,760

one at Jared no comment all right you

1216
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,220
kind of hit something on Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1217
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,569
think it's important and Dan I wish you

1218
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:16,569
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have asked this question and it's</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale and the infrastructure and</font>

1220
00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:21,440
today as I said a minute ago the entire

1221
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:24,109
v6 routing table will fit into 56 k ft

1222
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,740
cam well v6 isn't going to replace v4

1223
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:30,950
overnight you'll have v 4 p-6<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6p rsv4</font>

1226
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,380
you have the most experience with this

1227
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:38,390
have you don't need homework to

1228
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,980
extrapolate out how often you will have

1229
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,379
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> replace your line cards and upgrade</font>

1230
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:46,430
your memory exponentially and how often

00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that we have not done that because we</font>

have not seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> any need because the</font>

1233
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:53,960
traffic levels are not even anywhere

1234
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,180
near significant when compared to the v4

1235
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,670
traffic levels we're outside we're

1236
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:01,970
spending more<font color="#CCCCCC"> time upgrading the cards</font>

1237
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:03,890
to handle the v4 stuff and along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

1238
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,930
we pick up the additional v6

1239
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:08,058
functionality on some of the platforms

1240
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:10,279
that we have that do not do all of the

1241
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:13,190
forwarding and hardware so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we're</font>

1242
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,559
upgrading our v4 capacity we're picking

00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">up the v6 stuff along the way so you get</font>

00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:19,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for free to this one last question</font>

1247
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:27,169
it will d egra gate there's no stopping

1248
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:30,020
it so how do you keep up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1250
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:34,490
think that I would actually somewhat

1251
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:36,589
defer to to Jason's numbers on that that

1252
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:39,558
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yet the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> D aggregation</font>

1253
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:42,650

where everyone has to fork over those

think RF<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs hey Ted the other question</font>

1264
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:10,799
is will your vendors be able to build

1265
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,929
the router big enough

1266
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:15,449
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> live in the</font>

1270
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:24,029
you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost unlimited number of</font>

and route distinguisher with 2547 and

1273
00:53:26,939 --> 00:53:30,928
folks are now experiencing now that

1274
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:32,789
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big frame relay to 2547</font>

00:53:35,089 --> 00:53:41,279
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that uncommon so why is this</font>

1278
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:43,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">more of a big deal with the potentially</font>

the problem that our providers have to

we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting actually for our v6</font>

we'd never use in production John

of the IP ng Directorate in ninety three

<font color="#E5E5E5">started and we were trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font>

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it's a lot different than it</font>

1361
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,890
was back then they went through a few

1362
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:24,259
evolutions through the IETF there was an

1363
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:26,118
implication earlier that Aaron processes

1364
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:29,529
applications and sometimes those

1365
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:32,240
applications aren't a hundred percent

1366
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:34,750
reflecting reality but and so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1367
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,549
joke really so I got to say something

<font color="#E5E5E5">everything we can to verify applications</font>

1373

1374
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:54,200
people and take this opportunity that as

1375
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:57,770
we go through the next 10 or 15 years

1376
00:57:54,200 --> 00:58:00,230
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> demand for v4 addresses sort of</font>

1377
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:03,130
continues unabated and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> total</font>

1378
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:05,420
quantity also is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed number that the</font>

V for applications is going to ramp up

and actually over an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're</font>

00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,299
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have discussions of that over</font>

1383
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:17,510
the next few meetings about how much

1384
00:58:14,299 --> 00:58:20,029
work should it be to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that next ipv4</font>

1385
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:22,220
address and I actually would encourage

00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:25,400
people to begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thought process</font>

1387
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:27,379
here what do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should do to</font>

1388
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:31,430
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers when they go and ask for an</font>

1389
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:34,039
ipv4 address block and then what would

1390
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:36,470
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself put up with when you go to</font>

1391
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:39,010
ask for that same block particularly as

1392
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:43,390
we get just a decade<font color="#CCCCCC"> or so down the road</font>

iij considering that the number of

00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:06,230
current ipv6 allocations has many orders

1399

of magnitudes more host than the total

run ipv6 in my a s and the router is

subject to being cannibalized for parts

1409
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:43,229
when the other router dies and it's

okay last comment Tony hain just follow

<font color="#E5E5E5">up real quickly on that and then get</font>

1423
01:00:19,589 --> 01:00:23,790
reason that there's analysis paralysis

1424
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:25,618
because the original round of analysis

1425
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:28,020
had a list of self conflicting

1426
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:29,790
requirements and in fact if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> space here the network</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">operators have a set of requirements and</font>

1429
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:35,609
the insights episode of requirements and

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> several of those are explicitly</font>

1431
01:00:35,609 --> 01:00:41,578
conflicting and then when you overlay

1432
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:45,329
don't blow up the routing table on top

1433
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of all that it really gets bad so yes</font>

1434
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:51,780
that's what's caused it<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering is</font>

1435
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,790
the art of making compromises understand

1436
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:56,359
and so that's that's the ref consensus

1437
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:59,460
part that you agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we needing it</font>

1438
01:00:56,359 --> 01:01:01,558
and we've lost that partially because

1439
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,440
this community has stopped participating

1440
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:07,410
in the IDF effectively and so the IETF

1441
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,780
kind of spirals out of control without a

1442
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:11,730
feedback mechanism except for people to

1443
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:12,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">come here periodically and and carry the</font>

1444
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:17,250
message back and there's not enough

1445
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:19,049
voices so I encourage you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

1446
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">that problem right if you want the IETF</font>

different way of looking at the problem

1457
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:51,450
and how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about this thing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">long term allow the sites that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

1465

shape or form they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a routing</font>

1467
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:12,868
slot right it's how do you distinguish

1468
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:15,598
the big guy from the little<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy in a</font>

1469
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:18,869
reasonable way and it make a consistent

1470
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,099
determination of that and hard prefix

1471
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:23,010
boundaries has been done in the past

1472
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:25,440
that's not necessarily a good choice

1473
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:28,530
we need to rethink that problem and

1474
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,560
think about is this mythical global

1475

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time it that's really what it</font>

1491
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,870
comes down to is if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing</font>

1492
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:21,390
to step up to the IETF and say we need a

anymore because it doesn't sell boxes

1502
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:49,819
I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually argue against that</font>

01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:52,038
because they're selling the boxes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

and if it doesn't meet the service

v6 or before is probably not relevant to

this discussion I mean you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the</font>
