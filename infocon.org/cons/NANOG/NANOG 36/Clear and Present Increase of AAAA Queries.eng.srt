on queries between user resolvers and

26
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,490
that ipv6 will be supports valuing

27
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,600
operating systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the other cause is</font>

28
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,449
a domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> name completion function and</font>

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,630
this function is automatically performed

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,149
by operating system of applications now

31
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,679
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider these reasons embodied</font>

let me move on through the discussion

160
00:10:53,290 --> 00:11:01,780

163
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,830

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,470
in terms of the number of queries out

175
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,859
there if you consider the alternative

176
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:10,040
approaches to this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective of an</font>

177
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,200
applications designer I'm going to look

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">up a name I'm not sure exactly which</font>

181
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,100
just to ask everything at once because I

182
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,589
don't know I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask for one</font>

183
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,899
name and get back NX domain and ask the

184
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:28,670
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> name because that increases the</font>

185
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,830
latency I have in the application so a

186
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:34,189
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> patience for developers will want</font>

187
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask everything they can at once so in</font>

188
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,350
that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to make the</font>

189
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,520
application develop a little smarter

190
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,100
about what they asked for that know

191
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,750
ahead of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask or not ask and not</font>

192
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,750
make it dependent on the query chain

193
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,709
let's say the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other the other</font>

194
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,360
alternative<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is to create a new way</font>

of asking dns and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for effort for</font>

197
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:57,380
one query that's been thought of and has

198
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,790
never really been successful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not saying that we shouldn't try again</font>

200
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,240
but we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to with</font>

201
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,820
indiana's protocol figure out how to ask

202
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,320
more than one question at a time so in

203
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,930
terms of asking more things at one time

204
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,610
in DNS that's been hard getting

205
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,949
applications to ask things more

206
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,600
intelligently is going to be hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sew</font>

207
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,890
it comes back to is what you're seeing

208
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,440
here going to be that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of a problem</font>

209
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">why not with the applications do all</font>

210
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,279
this post processing of all the queries

211
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,529
at one time and just let the DNS handle

212
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,790
the load I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that necessary</font>

213
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,649
the right way to go but that's that's

214
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,920
kind of a three-part decision process

215
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:32,950
here I guess that's the first comment I

216
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,949
have

217
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:42,510
or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom I understand is right that</font>

218
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,729
you are saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh another kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

219
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,850
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> is packing all the information</font>

220
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">into what or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gaiters packets that right</font>

221
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,930
yeah if it is basically you want to be

222
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,490
asked to answer more than one go back to

223
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,920
the ITF and say we want you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

224
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:59,700
multiple queries in a packet yeah which

225
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of protocol work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

226
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,910
thank you very much thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

227
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:09,330
for this uh Joel yay glee university of

228
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:12,360
oregon um from your projections do you

229
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,370
have a sense of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of those new</font>

230
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,360
queries will actually have to fail over

231
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:20,520
to tcp in order to be responded to oh

232
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,010
you made that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay ova probably six</font>

233
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:26,400
Dupree cool what no could I failover

234
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,050
from UDP DNS queries to ICP DNS queries

235
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,260
because the record that's returned is

236
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:35,130
too big to fit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet me because</font>

237
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,680
obviously that in terms of providing a

238
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:41,700
resolver that's a new larger resource

239
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,680
consumption right there right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

240
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:50,390
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a three-way handshake in</font>

241
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:54,479
order to return a response to a query oh

242
00:14:50,390 --> 00:15:00,030
oh I better sorry that I couldn't get

243
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:04,650
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the question so you are asking</font>

244
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:07,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the oh that if windows using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

245
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:12,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP connection instead of that yippee</font>

246
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:15,180
yeah yeah another yes so I you know I

247
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,980
make a DNS query right and I get a

248
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,870
packet back from the dns server that

249
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,480
says it's too large you're going to have

250
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,100
to use TCP to make that query right

251
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:29,880
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kind of resource</font>

252
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:32,850
consumption on my resolver then if I if

253
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,980
I can use UDP the UDP query is obviously

254
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,930
a lot faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean one of the</font>

255
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">implications here is that if you have a</font>

256
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,989
lot of queries that return<font color="#CCCCCC"> quad-a</font>

257
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,449
records that are big enough that they

258
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:47,870
don't fit in a single packet then you've

259
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:47,870
got a lot more TCP DNS traffic

260
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,510
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get try to answer the</font>

261
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,710
question actually in this case Joel most

262
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,970
of the other answers coming back is we

263
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,260
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that information so they</font>

264
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:01,390
wouldn't fail over so it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number</font>

265
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:05,650
of UDP hits<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so long as the next</font>

266
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:08,110
domain you're fine yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trondheim one of</font>

267
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,660
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't talk about in your</font>

268
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:13,900
sequence of events was what happens when

269
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,540
the v6 record is returned you know as

270
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,340
valid does it stop the chain right there

271
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,500
you know you're focusing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point of</font>

272
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,780
there aren't any v6 records and how long

273
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:26,170
it takes to fail through how many

274
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:28,240
queries happen what happens when the v6

275
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,290
answer does come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back it is the first</font>

276
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the question the second point is</font>

277
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,130
you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your last item here about</font>

278
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,590
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to flip the order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and have the</font>

279
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:42,189
air records queried first if you do that

280
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,110
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never leave ipv4 because as soon</font>

281
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,270
as it resolves ipv4 the traffic will say

282
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,950
ipv4 and all of the traffic on the

283
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet will stay ipv4 and people will</font>

284
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,520
perceive that that's the way they have

285
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,290
to do through their<font color="#E5E5E5"> work if you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

286
00:16:51,520 --> 00:17:00,160
actually get off of ipv4 you have to

287
00:16:53,290 --> 00:17:03,360
resolve a v6 record first oh yeah you

288
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">are oh your think that that L ipv4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

289
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,030
asking is the first takes to do no I'm

290
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,950
