00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,790
the nanog afternoon tutorial session

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,910
this is the SP security primer or primer

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,700
101 if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Phil Smith's</font>

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,198
systems on SP<font color="#E5E5E5"> and large network security</font>

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,519
solutions my colleague very green was

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,650
going to be giving this talk today but

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,919
very couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it so I'm doing my</font>

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,019
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill in in his stead I do work</font>

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,809
for cisco as a vendor however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,879
operational background I spent four of

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,968
my five years at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco operating a s109</font>

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,280
which is cisco's network including the

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,309
network connectivity for CCO or as we

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">call it these days Cisco com Cisco is an</font>

18
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,879
enterprise but it's also a large SP like

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">enterprise and it's a content provider</font>

20
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of ww Cisco</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> com we have iOS</font>

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,610
images we have documentation we're also

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,858
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> e-commerce shop prior to that I spent</font>

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,780
several years working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an ASP doing a</font>

24
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,190

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,899
again handling operational security

26
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,450
prior to that I work for Bell Atlantic

27
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,130
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through and</font>

28
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,680
spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time today talking about</font>

29
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,240
tools and techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can use to</font>

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,759
enhance the security of the service

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,189
provider network and we want to be able

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,780
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools and techniques that don't</font>

33
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,789
require us to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and buy a bunch of</font>

34
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,439
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff rather what we want to do is</font>

35
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,210
deleverage the existing network

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,439

bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> affects a little bit of elbow</font>

38

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,619
much easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font>

also be posted in PDF format and an

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually take this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">do train-the-trainer types of things and</font>

and those kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of applications so</font>

54
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,060
what's our goal today our goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

55
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,730
afternoon<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through 10 basic</font>

techniques that basically any<font color="#CCCCCC"> SP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> enhance the security of the</font>

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,590
at work and make the network more

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,849
resilient and also make your lives a

60
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,090
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're faced with</font>

61
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:23,910
security incidents this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much a</font>

62
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,140
technology neutral presentation we're

63
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,390
going to be talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things will</font>

64
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,208
work on basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> any modern router</font>

65
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,500
vendors equipment and each of these

66
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,970
techniques are proven this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

67
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,700
theoretical stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff that people</font>

68
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,590
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in real life that's proven to</font>

69
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,089
work over and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so</font>

70
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,110
when we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> security incident I think</font>

71
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,299
we've all<font color="#CCCCCC"> been faced with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

72
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,340
situation at one time or another but we

73
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DOS attack that gets launched</font>

74
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,480
against one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers and the</font>

75
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:55,140
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets taken out the customers</font>

76
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,268
cpe router gets taken out and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SRO</font>

00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">nsp network infrastructure like our</font>

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,049
customer aggregation router for example

79
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,548
gets affected as well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an</font>

80
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,599
embarrassing situation and it's not

81
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you really want to have to</font>

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,690
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the management so what we're</font>

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,920
going to talk about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some tools</font>

84
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and techniques that will hopefully allow</font>

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,988
us to lessen the risk of this kind of

86
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,670
scenario so that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sleep at night</font>

87
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,079
and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get woken up in the middle of</font>

88
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> night that we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with security</font>

89
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,290
incidents quickly and effectively so

90
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,170
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to spend a whole lot</font>

91
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of time handling these things we have</font>

92
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,608
multiple threats we obviously have the

93
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,069
botnet threat which is the big one where

94
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have tens of thousands hundreds of</font>

95
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,638
thousands and in some cases you know up

96
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,010
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a million</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bots their members of a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dos attacks sometimes we see smooth</font>

100
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,480
smooth traffic would you see lots of

101
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,540
traffic we also see worms that have

102
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,940
their poorly written actually and have

103

<font color="#CCCCCC">that are proper their aggressive</font>

105
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:53,340
propagation mechanisms these things can

106
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">take out the service provider</font>

107
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,630
infrastructure that can take out the

108
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,579
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course they impact our SL</font>

109
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,569
age and therefore our revenue not

110
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:03,810
something that we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to deal</font>

111
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,970
with we have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ongoing series of very</font>

security related talks that that we do

here at nanog and you can get more of

this type of material from the Earl

the end of the press

123

tation but the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

124
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,359
this list and not to try to pick all of

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,010
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go back all fired up</font>

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do them all at once because</font>

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,200
if you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do everything at once</font>

128
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,359
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get anything</font>

129
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,280
accomplished instead what we want to do

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,320
is touch on the important aspects of

131
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,830
each of these 10 things we can do and

132
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,080
then take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that knowledge back back home</font>

133
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,060
and then pick one and start working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">it iteratively so we don't want to try</font>

topic here is preparing your knock every

it's an actual room where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you at where</font>

you do shifts in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> knock and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

for improvement and as personnel

with different skill sets that needs the

kind of thing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not static so what</font>

169
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,980
what is an offset team every service

170
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,740
provider should also have an operational

171
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,470
security or a knob sec team some ESPYs

172
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,750
have dedicated offset personnel for

173
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,790
others the offset personnel are actually

a subset<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the escalation team</font>

staff as well it's really important

177
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,750
though that there is a designated<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC</font>

178

team which has not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the</font>

responsibility but the authority and the

come up with a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy it needs</font>

to be well thought out with input from a

lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different areas of the service</font>

provider and it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be articulated</font>

194
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:10,020
it needs to be written down somewhere

195
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,930
once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good security policy</font>

196
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,490
defined we then get the resources that

we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement that security</font>

policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks sometimes that can take</font>

the network and see what's happening on

to respond when bad things happen under

208
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:39,750
about we need to practice that's really

<font color="#E5E5E5">key we don't want the first run of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not has figuring out how to</font>

212
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,878
deal with security incidents to be a

213
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:50,190
live incident instead we need to train

214
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,259
we need to prepare we need to try to

215
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,909
extrapolate realistic scenarios and come

216
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,909
up with playlist is how we're going to

217
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:57,960
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them again we can't ever be</font>

218
00:07:55,909 --> 00:08:00,180
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

219
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,339
went to cover every contingency but we

220
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,599
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover as many as possible and of</font>

221
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:04,680
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we deal with security</font>

222
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,599
incidents we want to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that knowledge</font>

223
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,699
back and incorporate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into our</font>

224
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,620
playbook so it will have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> game that</font>

225
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,849
experience for everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font>

226
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,589
the next time something bad happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> post</font>

227
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:18,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">mortems are really really important root</font>

228
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:20,460
cause analysis analyses are really

229
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:22,229
really important a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font>

230
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,180
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> invest the time to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this but</font>

231
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:27,330
it really pays off so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I strongly urge</font>

232
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,919
you to to incorporate that into your mix

233
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:35,880
as well so the preparation problems a

234
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:38,578
lot of SPS don't really have<font color="#CCCCCC"> knocks they</font>

235
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,250
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-defined op SEC teams</font>

236
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:43,588
they don't have procedures written down

237
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,800
anywhere they don't have communications

238
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:49,020
plans and so when a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> incident</font>

239
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,339
takes place it's a mad scramble rushing

240
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,110
around trying to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what's</font>

241
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,990
happening and then what you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

242
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,130
do about it

243
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,490
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been in that</font>

244
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,380
situation before<font color="#E5E5E5"> whew whew honest folks</font>

245
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,480
here okay I know I have and it's not a

246
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,040
pleasant place to be so what we want to

247
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is to emphasize that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really</font>

248
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,149
important to take the time to do these

249
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,640
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> upfront because it will really</font>

250
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:13,450
pay off for you and for your customers

251
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:16,120
moving forward we<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed a sixth</font>

252
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,279
phase Incident Response methodology that

253
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,839
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> proven to be pretty effective most</font>

254
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,820
people work through most of these phases

255
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:26,260
anyway but sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a good idea to</font>

256
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:28,089
actually write it down and identify some

257
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,800
of the various<font color="#CCCCCC"> components of each steps</font>

258
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:31,779
it gives us a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font>

259
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,430
handling security incidents it also

260
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,990
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to describe things to</font>

261
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,969
management and explain the management

262
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,850
what it is that we're doing and why so

263
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,860
six phases preparation this is where we

264
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,600
get our tools our techniques are<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

265
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">are op SEC teams</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find our areas of</font>

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility our communications plans</font>

267
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,360
and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that stuff in place so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

268
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,459
we're ready whenever an incident takes

269
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,709
place next phase is detection

270
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:55,239
identification finding out something

271
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,069
that something bad is happening that we

272
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,930
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something about oftentimes</font>

273
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">detection consists of the customer</font>

274
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,300
calling up and saying help the

275
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet's down you got to do something</font>

276
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:07,149
to save me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that still is a very common</font>

277
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,740
detection mechanism it's effective it

278
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,050
works but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

279
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,420
more proactive if we can with tools and

280
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,010
telemetry and so forth so once we do

281
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,170
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've detected or identified</font>

282
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,569
that something's taking place the next

283
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,939
step is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to classify it what is taking</font>

284
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,459
place and what is the scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

285
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,860
threat is it a customer that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

286
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:28,149
threatened is it multiple customers is

287
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,300
it the service provider infrastructure

288
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:34,120
itself this informs the next step<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

289
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,859
is traced back figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font>

290
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,779
bad stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from where is it</font>

291
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">ingresa ng the network is it coming from</font>

292
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:43,360
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier is it coming from an upstream or</font>

293
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,270
downstream is it coming from a cracked

294
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,270
box and the IDC so where is the bad

295
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,500
stuff coming into the network from once

296
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,770
we figured out where the bad stuff is

297
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,020
coming from we want to react we want to

298
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,089
react<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mitigate the attack stop the</font>

299
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,310
bad stuff from happening and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

300
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:01,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">key that we have enough visibility into</font>

301
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,819
the network and we have well-defined

302
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,359
procedures so that during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reaction</font>

303
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,100
phase we don't make a mistake and

304
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,709
actually make the problem worse than it

305
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,220
really is what happens pretty frequently

306
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:15,510
with SPS that are not prepared to deal

307
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,100
with security incidents and have to

308
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,010
figure it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the fly each time and</font>

309
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,959
now the sixth step which in many ways is

310
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,850
almost the most important step but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

311
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,459
a step that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people skip the</font>

312
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">postmortem excuse me during the</font>

313
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,119
post-mortem phase we need to sit down

314
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how we handle the</font>

316
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,019
do better and then take that<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowledge</font>

317
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,029
and put that back into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sixth phase</font>

318
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,740
process that we in our preparation phase

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're ready to deal with the next</font>

of interests there are lots of different

communities of interest that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

325
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,070
important that service providers are

members of and that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of</font>

327
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,320
because they can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us when</font>

328
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,700
we're dealing with a security event

329
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,500
oftentimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> security events of course are</font>

330
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,170
not constrained just to one service

331
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,970
provider they can be big network-wide

332
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,500
events like slammer they can be

distributed denial-of-service attacks

basically with d shield you can take

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,099
security incidents and by pulling them

381
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:04,619
into DC or they then are pulled in with

382
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:06,089
the analysis pile and the data is shared

383
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:08,189
with everybody else that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> look for</font>

384
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,349
trends things like an uptick in a

385
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:12,748
particular protocol or port an uptick in

386
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:14,579
probing certain types of applications

387
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:17,879
it's a really valuable community

388
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:19,649
resource it's it's funded and operated

389
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,849
by ISC and i really recommend that you

390
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,579
participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get started</font>

391
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:25,350
with it at home just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a on your broadband</font>

392
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:28,769
connection near our clients like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

393
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,269
for various types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of operating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> systems</font>

394
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:32,100
and it takes logs from many different

395
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,659
types of network devices so get started

396

<font color="#CCCCCC">on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home broadband connection and</font>

contribute to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's kind of</font>

398
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:39,118
a macroscopic view of what's happening

401
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:47,339
useful in<font color="#E5E5E5"> SP sec how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people here</font>

00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:09,959
kind of like Fight Club we don't talk to

412
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:12,149
the first rule of Fight Club is we don't

small service providers around the world

an attack against this / 32 we're seeing

if folks change job functions and

will then take you off the list so SP

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,320
application process and let's work on

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,429
getting you a voucher<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and on the</font>

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,740
after this tutorial session is over with

520
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,350
in the Gold Room I believe Daniel

521

<font color="#E5E5E5">Macpherson from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Arbor is generally</font>

525
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:21,270
right and then in asia pac we also have

00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:23,520
security box at apricot and derek tay

<font color="#CCCCCC">and dylan green from juniper armchair</font>

528
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,960
those so cert and first cert computer is

529
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,450
emergency response team first forum for

530
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,030
incident reporting and security teams

531
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,120
it's a very important resource is

532
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:42,090
important that service providers become

533
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,770
members of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the relevant certs and</font>

534
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,510
of the first team it's really important

535
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,760
because it's again another confidential

536
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,650
community where a lot of information

537
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,090
sharing takes place good way to learn

538
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,919
who your peers are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for other</font>

539
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,928
service providers and for vendors it's

540
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,110
also really important for vendors to

541
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:59,700
join the first as well that way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

542
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,408
a forum in<font color="#E5E5E5"> which hopefully</font>

543
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,019
Remender cooperation can take place in

544
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:05,580
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with large security incidents</font>

545

546
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,340
a whole if you're not a member first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

547
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:13,678
strongly suggest that you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Earl</font>

548
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,658
there and check it out definitely worth

549
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,510
your time it will pay some dividends if

550
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:20,100
your organization is a member of first

551
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:23,639
so moving on to our third thing the I

552
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,649
knock DBA phone system so the I nachdi

553
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,689
be a phone system let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font>

554
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:29,760
skip skip a slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> here as a little bit</font>

555
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,289
out of order so essentially when service

556
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,940
providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are working attacks together</font>

557
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:34,769
it's important that they be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

558
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,590
communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes we have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp sec</font>

559
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:39,720
email list and again Jared much

560
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,240
maintains the canonical knock operators

561

list on<font color="#E5E5E5"> park better net but sometimes</font>

562
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,440
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important to be able to pick</font>

563
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">up the phone and get some body with clue</font>

564
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,909
at the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the phone and that</font>

565
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:53,630
is this the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the I not DBA</font>

566
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:56,669
sip phone system is intended to solve

567
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,950
basically the idea here is that we want

568
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:01,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a bat phone right a</font>

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">knock hotline that you can pick up and</font>

570
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,610
very easily get a hold of the

571
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,559
appropriate folks at other service

572
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,360
providers to work instance together as

573
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,700
folks who have the enable password and

574
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,090
can do something about a security

575
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,950
incidents so how do you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

582
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,529

583
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:30,600

584
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,429

585

598
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:03,600
with a s109 you can also have sub

600

on Barry's phone number is 109 and then

601
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:13,410

of phones for their personnel we even

622

have people who carry their phones

somebody with a clue who actually has an

actual problem that needs to be solved

641
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,709
um we've run into a couple of issues

642
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,110
with folks who have IT departments that

for some reason or<font color="#E5E5E5"> another don't want to</font>

they look to allow sip through a

647
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,290
problem sometimes if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go your</font>

they could bypass the firewall

666
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,280
get the SIP traffic up and running so

<font color="#CCCCCC">they'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be creative there are some ways</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to audit the configurations to</font>

make sure that no unauthorized changes

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,790
have been made that can sometimes be an

682
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,070
indicator that something bad is

683
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,320
happening we needed to perform a risk

684
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,600
assessment on our own network we need to

685
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,169
look at every aspect to the network from

686
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the backbone to the IDC to the NOC to</font>

any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of remote access solution</font>

688
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,540
whether it's SSH or VPN or what have you

689
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,610
and think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the different threat</font>

690

vectors in each portion of the network

691
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:26,100
and then take the appropriate action to

692
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,710
mitigate those threat vectors so very

693
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,870
basic thing is make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we note</font>

694
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,370
that everybody in the world can't ssh

management<font color="#E5E5E5"> network which we should we</font>

it's really important that we make use

of a triple a method that encrypts the

770
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,500
we see that that happened fairly often

rare or theoretical so it's really

important that we protect that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple A</font>

firewall<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you staple inspection on</font>

822
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,710
implement things like our vty ackles in

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restrict the access to the</font>

826
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,710
and touch your router I could generate

SNMP traffic and sending it would make

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,870
customer access edge it's really

849
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,700
important that we do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

850
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,260
power to limit the amount of traffic

that can reach out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> touch the routers</font>

852
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,629
because we can end up with accidental or

853
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:27,000
deliberate doses if we rely solely on

854
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,650
things like SNMP<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles and BTW</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i apples</font>

855
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,320
and things of that nature and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

856
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,060
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nice things about apples in</font>

857
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,860
general is that on higher-end boxes you

858
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:37,200
often have hardware acceleration so that

859
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> akal processing is taken is taking</font>

860
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,660
place on an ASIC and generally speaking

861
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,760
that's going to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a far more</font>

862
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,320
robust kind of resistance to attack then

00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,540
letting things leak up to the process

monitoring the configure the devices is

867
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,940
also extremely important<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes the</font>

868
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,440

873
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,760
those commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up changing the</font>

874
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,010
config of the router so it's really

875
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,140
important that we go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and grab our</font>

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,379
infrastructure there are some really

883
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,510
cool tools do this when the most popular

884

ones is called rancid<font color="#E5E5E5"> the really awesome</font>

888
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,250
well there's also another tool called

889
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,380
the rat who will stands for router audit

890
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,460

891
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,740

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> assign scores two different</font>

893
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,830

and bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer authentication and things</font>

895
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,980
like that that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually take</font>

896
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,570
these configs and run them through the

898
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:02,610
score to tell you how relatively secure

899
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,139
each one of your routers is pretty

900
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,580
putting useful tools again these are

901
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">open-source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tools we don't have to spend</font>

902
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">any money we just need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some time</font>

903
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:14,250
download them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and set them up and start</font>

904
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:16,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">using them so protecting the edge so</font>

905
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,690
again the old world what we would do is

906
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:20,780
we would go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> secure each of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

907
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,280

908
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,280
every router was accessible from the

909
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:27,889
outside in the new rule we want to make

910
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,389
use of filters to stop random traffic

911
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,530
from coming in and touching our network

912
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,690
infrastructure unless it's something

913
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:34,610
that we really really need so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

914
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,920
is basically erect a force shield around

915
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,899
the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network generally</font>

916
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,430
speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are very few reasons why</font>

917
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need to receive network traffic</font>

918
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,700
towards your routers I mean you know

919
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,590
people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to trace her out</font>

920
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,870
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network that's fine but there's</font>

921
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,340
unless it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> special circumstance</font>

922
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,050
people should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SNMP</font>

00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:56,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">not be able to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to your routers</font>

925
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:58,220
so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we want to filter out all</font>

926
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,870
that garbage before it hits the routers

927
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,120
and percolates up to the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font>

928
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:04,100
there will be instances in which traffic

929
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">does need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come in for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example GRE</font>

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:15,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a good handle on those things</font>

934
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:17,870
initially we can use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> various tools</font>

935
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,370
like classification apples to see what

936
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,509
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's hitting our routers and look</font>

937
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:23,409
and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it all seems to be</font>

938
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:26,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">legitimate and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then filter out the rest</font>

939
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,830
obviously we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what the</font>

943
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,760
important to summarize as much as

944
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,529
possible because the more we can

945
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">summarize our address space and have a</font>

946
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,370
well-defined address space to shorter

947
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:43,549
and more manageable our apples are in

948
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:45,679

951
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,919

987
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:05,660
hang around afterwards but the point is

988
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:07,569
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to take care of special case</font>

989
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,279
traffic fragments is one good example

990
00:36:07,569 --> 00:36:12,680
another good<font color="#E5E5E5"> example is other protocols</font>

991
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:18,619
most of the traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see is TCP</font>

992
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:21,200
UDP ICMP right but there's 255 actual

993
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:25,160
valid IP protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 254</font>

994
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,739
you know their protocols like GRE ESP

995
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,118
aah those kinds of things again a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

996
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:31,910
folks go to the trouble of doing

classification apples and and in using

998
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,089
net flow and what have you and figuring

999
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,859
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what should we headed to their</font>

1000

1001
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:41,359
and UDP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICMP based of traffic that</font>

1002
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,950
should not be hitting their their

1003
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,489

non<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP non UDP non ICMP protocols and</font>

1005
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:49,519
so we've seen cases in which folks been

a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time and effort on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there I</font>

1008
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,249

1009
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,569
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I GMP just to send a</font>

1011
00:36:56,569 --> 00:36:59,989
through those apples or those firewall

1012

rules whatever you're using just as if

1013
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:03,440
they weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even there so it's really</font>

1014
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:05,058
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think outside of the box</font>

1015
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,009
here not just limit yourself to the

1016
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:09,140
class all kinds of traffic that we deal

1017
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:11,719
with on an ongoing basis but think about

1018
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the various IP protocols and ensure</font>

1019
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:15,170
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we only allow the ones to your</font>

1020
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:17,359

1021
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:19,249
from the sources that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can that are</font>

1022
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,249

00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:24,738
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic headed towards your core</font>

1024
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:26,269

see with it has no business headed in

1037

infrastructure actual deployed well for

1040
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,780
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the loopback range</font>

1041
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,250

1042
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,840
in and so if we're seeing traffic that

1043
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,730
purports to originate from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop rack</font>

1045
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,910
we're going to drop that traffic in our

1048
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,490
from a legitimate source you know in

<font color="#E5E5E5">other words it doesn't appear to be</font>

1050
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,479

1051
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">our routers well unless there's a</font>

legitimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for that traffic to</font>

1053
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,100
head to our routers and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch</font>

1054
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,410
them we should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and deny it</font>

1055
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,700
and drop it at the edge what's an

1056
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:30,359
example of traffic that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let</font>

1057
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:32,399
in well let's say that we have um<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font>

1058
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,780
179 because we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP session going</font>

1059
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,930
with a customer obviously we want to

00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,000
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bidirectionally 3-hour</font>

00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> poke holes through our</font>

blocked when we deploy the I<font color="#CCCCCC"> apples IP</font>

1069
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,680
options or another special case IP

1070
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,050
options provide control functions for

1071
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,029
certain types of IP traffic the most

1072
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,080
famous instance of this is um source

1073
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:08,970
routing is required also for RSVP

1074
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,490
options are typically not<font color="#E5E5E5"> handled in</font>

1075
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:14,100
hardware even on a sick based platforms

1076
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,899
and so what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that we</font>

1077
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,900
do is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take a hard look at the</font>

1078
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,640
use of options in our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1079
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:23,160
various types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware from different</font>

1080
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,810
vendors have typically they have the

1081
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,250
capability most most vendors have the

1082
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,049
capability these days to filter out

1083
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,880
options or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just simply drop them or</font>

1084
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,590
ignore them so make use of those

1085
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,570
capabilities if your hardware has it

1086
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,310
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you leave options on</font>

1087
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:38,010
where you need it for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

1088
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:41,700
have RSVP deployed for some of your quad

1089
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:43,800
stuff but the idea here is again we're

1090
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,330
just simply minimizing the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1091
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,490
traffic that can reach out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and touch the</font>

1092
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:49,110
router or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of transit traffic</font>

1093
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,450
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case that can cost stuff to</font>

1094
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:56,040
bubble up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the process level</font>

1096
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,359
want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't bite off</font>

1097
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,950
more than we can chew with

1098
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:08,819
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles we want to do with iterative</font>

1099
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:11,129
deployment so we pick a very wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> range</font>

1100
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:13,049
of protocols initially and that we're

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allow through and we slowly now</font>

1102
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:18,089
or narrow it down by observation and we

1103
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,910
get more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more and more granular as</font>

1104
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:22,680
time goes on that way we avoid making

1105
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:25,769
mistakes that could cause outages as we

1106
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,839
deploy our I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ackles again we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1107
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:30,029

<font color="#CCCCCC">akal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start classifying the traffic</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">easier to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manage or something like this</font>

or<font color="#CCCCCC"> classification Apple now something to</font>

1118
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,160
remember here is as you go through this

1119
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:52,410
classification process just because

1120
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,569
certain types of traffic shows up in the

1121
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,759
classification a couple or it shows up

1122
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:58,259
in net flow it doesn't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

1123
00:40:56,759 --> 00:41:00,029
that that traffic should in fact be

1124

1128
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:10,109
and catching some bad stuff as you go

better insight into our network traffic

that's headed towards the core we can

1178

then refine these<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles even further</font>

and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> them more granular so again we</font>

but it certainly is beats having nothing

1193
00:43:24,509 --> 00:43:28,710
at all there may be some places where

1194
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,940
you can't deploy I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ackles because of</font>

1195
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,319
certain circumstances because of

hardware limitations things of that

1197
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:35,308
nature always need to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in mind</font>

1198
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,049
it's very important to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1199
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:38,369
capabilities of your hardware before you

00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:40,469
do something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you don't want to</font>

1201
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:41,700
find out that a particular piece older

piece of hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have doesn't</font>

1203
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,989

1204
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:47,519
and deploy it and you end up causing a

1205
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:51,119
network outage so it's really important

1206
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,439
to to secure that again once we've gone

1207
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,239
ahead and deployed our I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles</font>

1208
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,950
everywhere we can what we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

happens at ibgp speeds propagating

across the network so it's very quick

1230
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,530
this is probably the number one reaction

1231
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,270
and mitigation tools that SPS have<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

with BGP to use it as a reaction again

1238
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:02,290
is amiss work so we see some bad traffic

1239
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:03,819
we've identified it that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

bad is happening and we want to block

00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,900
the traffic so we have a trigger router

1242

it could be a router it could be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux</font>

workstation running zebra or quagga or

00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:14,350
something like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually go</font>

1245
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,300
ahead and trigger a routing update that

1246
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:19,089
goes to all of our various edge routers

1247
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,700
and essentially advertises a specific

1248

route with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> destination a very</font>

attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> get sucked down into the bit</font>

pressure off the customer now one thing

destination based remote trigger black

1256
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:40,630
holing which is the most common form of

remote trigger black holing that we are

00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:49,060
as we do this it's a important tool in

the toolkit we need to understand the

1262
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,380
side effects of it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and of course</font>

1263
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,720
the bad traffic heads into the bit

1264
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,460
bucket once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> black hold it and again</font>

1265
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,750
as we work that inter provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1266
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,330
mitigation we were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about earlier</font>

1267
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:03,310
in the context of<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set remote trigger</font>

1268
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:05,319
black hole filtering is the most common

1269
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:06,610
tool that service providers use when

1270
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,960
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working a large attack in</font>

1271
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:11,680
conjunction with other service providers

1272
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:14,230
as well um this is again a very common

1273
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,060
tool it's proven it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well we</font>

1274
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:18,040
have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> documentation on how to do it</font>

1275
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">and again this is not cisco specific</font>

1276
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">this works with just about any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

1277
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,890
router on that speaks bgp there is a

1278
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,110
variation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this called source based</font>

1279
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,580
remote trigger black hole routing if you

1280
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,290
hit there's an anti spoofing mechanism

1281
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:32,230
and cisco land we call it unique a star

1282
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:35,290
p f other vendors have a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1283
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:36,970
mechanism and on certain devices and

1284
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,890
platforms you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually combine the</font>

1285
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,450
remote trigger black hole routing with

1286
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:42,160
the unique a CRPF function

1287
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:44,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said you can do source-based black</font>

1288
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,089
holing which is a really a powerful<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool</font>

1289
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,400
because you're no longer completing the

1290
00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:50,710
dots<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the attacker instead you're</font>

1291
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,430
able to actually block out the sources

1292
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:56,470
of an attack one another thing to think

1293
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:58,240
about in terms of remote trigger black

1294
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:00,609
hole filtering is that you may want a

1295
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,740
white less whitelist certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

1296
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">blocks like for example you're not or</font>

1297
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,640
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to whitelist the root</font>

1298
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:09,190
nameservers and the TLD name servers and

1299
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,170
things like that because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

1300
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:13,510
an attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perhaps generate a</font>

00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:16,030
spoofed attack coming from outside your

00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:17,859

1303
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,210
an important part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

1304
00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:20,828
infrastructure that your customers need

1305
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,470
in order to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make use of the</font>

00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:24,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet so moving right along another</font>

1307
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,410
one of the ten things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

1309
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:31,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">here are familiar with sinkholes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a</font>

1310
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,550
few so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind a sinkhole is</font>

1311
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,098
again we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leverage BGP and</font>

1312
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,510
this time instead of taking the traffic

1313
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and dropping in at the edges of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1314
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,170
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want to do is to take</font>

1315
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic that we're interested in and</font>

1316
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:44,680
pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to a designated portion of the</font>

1317
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,598
network where we have some

1318
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,609
instrumentation set up maybe where we

1319
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:51,130
have an arm on probe set up we have a

1320
00:47:48,609 --> 00:47:53,290
box running TCP dump a box running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1321
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:54,790
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so we can</font>

1322
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">take that traffic and suck it across the</font>

1323
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:59,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and pull it down into our</font>

1324
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">sinkhole that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can analyze it and see</font>

1325
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,009
if the traffic is bad traffic and if

1326
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:06,009
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to do some filtering or do</font>

1327
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:08,560
something about it we can also use

1328
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:10,180
sinkholes as a way to monitor attack

1329
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,190
noise and scans we can take some

1330
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,290
unallocated address space and advertise

1331
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:16,990
it out of the black hole essentially see

1332
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:18,759
what we suck in and that's also pretty

1333
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,078
pretty interesting to do that and along

1334
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,180
all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that we can go back</font>

1335
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">and analyze it there was actually a</font>

1336
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:27,640
pretty good tutorial um auf<font color="#CCCCCC"> Union honest</font>

1337
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:29,560
ago on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> tier 0 for it recommend that</font>

1338
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:32,098
you check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out get presentation</font>

1339
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:36,069
watch the vaad again here's the basic

1340
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:38,859
premise here<font color="#E5E5E5"> 172 168 20 not one is being</font>

1341
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:40,810
attacked it's a / 24 we have a sinkhole

1342
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:43,900
network over on the side there somewhere

1343
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:46,180
hanging off of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and what we</font>

1344
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,310
do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we advertise a more specific route</font>

1345
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:51,339
for the IP in question which in this

1346
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:54,220
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> was 117 168 21 we'll put a slash</font>

1347
00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:55,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">30t route into our ibgp</font>

1348
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,859
so that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a more specific route</font>

1349
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:58,240
and we can suck the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

1350
00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:01,060
originally headed for the target<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1351
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,890
attack into our sinkhole and that way

1352
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,270
again we can take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it with our</font>

1353
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,799
instrumentation and if we've implemented

1354
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:07,750
a scrubbing center of some kind we can

1355
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,310
maybe scrub the bad traffic then

1356
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:11,950
re-inject the good traffic so the good

1357
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:16,359
traffic will head on back down to the

1358
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:18,098
victim so again when we advertise a

1359
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:20,259
default route in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> search provider</font>

1360
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:22,030
network we can pull in all kinds of

1361
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,150
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff against scanning worms</font>

1362
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:26,530
malware that's looking to propagate you

1363
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,690
know worms that sit there and chatter

1364
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,790
then go across the entire IP address

1365
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,470
range like Code Red and<font color="#CCCCCC"> nim de you know</font>

1366
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,200
things of that nature so if you don't

1367
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:37,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a default in your network putting</font>

1368
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,919
default in the sinkhole can be pretty

1369
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">useful now one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to be</font>

1370
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,030
careful with with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinkhole however is</font>

1371
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:45,310
that you can suck down a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic</font>

1372
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:48,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">really quickly and sometimes this is bad</font>

1373
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:50,619
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe at very high rates of PPS</font>

1374
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,849
so when we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sinkhole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to</font>

1375
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:53,710
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're watching what's</font>

1376
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:55,060
happening that we understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font>

1377
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:57,400
of traffic we're pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> down that we</font>

1378
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,020
don't end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up melting part of our network</font>

1379
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something to consider if</font>

1380
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:03,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use default in a sinkhole because</font>

1381
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,359
default route is default route and if

1382
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:06,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">something bad starts happening</font>

1383
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:08,319
generating a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of traffic headed</font>

1384
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:10,390
towards non-existent net blocks it's all

1385
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,940
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sucked down into that</font>

sinkhole that's running this running

1387
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:18,220
give the default route so you need to be

1388
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">careful about that another technique</font>

1389
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can use in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conjunction with</font>

is to any cast sinkholes how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

here though is to talk about ingress

by employing anti spoofing technologies

not sure how it's going to work on their

1517
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,509
older hardware right and so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1518
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:19,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is to gain the knowledge through</font>

testing and through piloting these

our equipment and then move forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

it so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this well we don't</font>

00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:37,759
they can't can't do it we may have

have is capable doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step is</font>

1541
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:07,580
to pick a router and a port on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a router</font>

1542
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:09,530
do a pilot deployment there see how well

00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">it works take the lessons learned and</font>

1544
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:14,000
then replicate it next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we move up</font>

1545
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,529
to a whole line card on a router with

1546
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,140
all the interfaces on that on that

1547
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:20,030
particular line card let<font color="#CCCCCC"> that run for a</font>

1548
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:23,150
while make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it works ok let's do the</font>

1549
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:24,860
whole router at that point once we let

1550
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,360
that stew for a while it's good we took

1551
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,540
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> lessons learned we then deploy it</font>

1552
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:31,340
on multiple routers then once we have

1553
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,930
operational confidence in the various

1554
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:35,030
types of anti spoofing technologies that

1555
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:37,160
we're using we can then<font color="#CCCCCC"> write it all up</font>

1556
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,570
a standard operating procedure may and

1557
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,339
put it into our standards and things and

1558
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,420
deploy it throughout the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network again</font>

1559
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,890
you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing</font>

1560
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:44,720
as a flag day you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a phase</font>

1565
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:56,480
going slow and steady is a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1572
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:11,810
something we really strongly urge you to

as you can with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other things in</font>

on likely attack vectors for bgp and

00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:22,990
then some of the mechanisms<font color="#CCCCCC"> for dealing</font>

1607
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:26,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it so what are some ways that you</font>

1608
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:28,479
can whack a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP session and take it down</font>

1609
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:30,308
one thing you can do is try to saturate

1610
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,890
the received path cues on to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

the pipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> op we can try to mess with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1615
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:47,050
TCP session itself to drop the TCP

00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:50,200
session so that it's no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> cohesive</font>

1617
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:52,869
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> again casa das that way or if we</font>

1618
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,368
can affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp and cause I GP to</font>

1619
00:58:52,869 --> 00:58:56,950
drop with at that point we cause a

1620

1621
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:03,549
won't work either for ibgp so all the

1622
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,890
normal attack vectors that people use to

1623
00:59:03,549 --> 00:59:07,809
attack computers apply to routers I mean

1624
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:09,848
routers are after all computers right

1625
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:11,890
there special purpose computers running

1643
00:59:51,609 --> 00:59:57,460
saturate those cues again we basically

1644
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:58,720
squeeze out the valid packets we squeeze

1645

out the ballot packets so that they

communicate and we have all this garbage

1648
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:06,359
filling up cues and saturating it again

1701
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:08,789
do is we can configure a router so that

01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:12,599
when it generates on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp packets</font>

1703
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:13,530
that they have a TTL of 255 and that

1704
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:15,630
they reject

1705

think most modern router vendors support

1716

the GT sm and we can figure it this way

is secure our rounding connections right

1726
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:05,430
so we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too to authenticate our</font>

1727

good way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> typical way that</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with most routing vendors</font>

1734
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:23,910
is md5 peer authentication there's also

1735
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:26,760
some some good side effects of this

1736
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:29,120
besides the basic basic premise<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1737
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:33,060
authenticating your routing protocol

1738
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:35,160
relationships it also allows us to stop

1739
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:37,799
malformed packets from tearing down a

1740
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:40,170
session because the md5 checksum is

1741
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,730
typically done on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP part not just</font>

1742
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:43,500
on the routing updates oh it's actually

1743
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">a pretty effective mechanism in that</font>

1744
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,630
regard the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this can't</font>

1745
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:50,610
protect against however is that if

1746
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:52,350
somebody compromises a router that is

1747
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:53,490
set up properly it has routing

1748
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:55,380
authentication and all this good stuff

1749
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:57,330
if somebody compromises the router and

1750
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,380
then starts generating bogus routing

1751
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,610
updates there's nothing that the

1752
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:01,650
authentication is going to do because

1753
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:03,120
the session is authenticated so we still

1754
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:05,730
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our other things as</font>

1755
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:08,190
well turning on the md5 authentication

1756
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:09,360
is not a panacea it<font color="#E5E5E5"> raises the bar and</font>

1757
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:11,910
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing but it's not the</font>

end-all be-all router security so

01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:19,440
another attack vector attackers will

01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:21,359
often go up against the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp um BGP of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">have static hold on routes at our edges</font>

1763
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,940
but if we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the traffic across</font>

1764
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,360

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would we want to do as an attacker</font>

1777
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:00,359
well one thing we might want to do is to

1778
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:01,440
suck the traffic somewhere in the

1779
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,330
network where maybe we have a

compromised host<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in a position on</font>

1781
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:09,330
the network topology where it can sniff

1782
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:12,240
traffic so which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we said that we</font>

1783
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:14,759
essentially create excuse me our own

1784
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,259
sink hole right so we can pull the

1785
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,840
traffic pass and look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> user names</font>

passwords and banking information all

1789
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:30,120
claim address space that we really don't

1796
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:45,960
we get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of routing statements so that</font>

we're no longer advertising net locks

that we are supposed to be advertising

that somebody announced as some address

sometimes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> he this person might</font>

1818
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:34,680
that's really intended for you and it

1819
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,810
causes a big disturbance it can often

1820

they'll actually advertise an

so it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find them this is</font>

1875
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:35,278
a technique<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see used fairly</font>

1876
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:37,230
often so it's very important that we

01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,900
prefix filter at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the edges of our</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">network with the as much specificity as</font>

obvious bone on routes that we're not

01:08:44,339 --> 01:08:50,399
accepting obviously unallocated routes

1882
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,778
for unallocated net blocks and we

1883
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:54,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly don't want to be able to</font>

accept somebody else's route

1885

advertisements from our<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers now</font>

1886
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:00,089
there are always exceptions to this of

01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">course but in generally speaking these</font>

1888
01:09:00,089 --> 01:09:04,229
are the principles<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want to</font>

1889
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:07,439
follow again we have bogans especially

1890
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:09,839
use addresses iana maintains the near

1891
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,040
the canonical authority for allocated

1892
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:14,130
net blocks there's the Earl where you

1893
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:17,908
can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> in check team come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bri also</font>

1894
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:19,350
carries a nice set of filters that are

1895
01:09:17,908 --> 01:09:20,939
based around these and every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

1896
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:23,310
net lock is peeled off and allocated

1897
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:27,210
those example filter templates are

1898
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:28,770
updated we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have special use</font>

1899
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:31,948
addresses that are intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> for special</font>

1900
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:36,120
use things like 127 00<font color="#CCCCCC"> not one which is</font>

1902
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,269
again these are things in the normal

1903
01:09:37,529 --> 01:09:43,199
course of events that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just don't see</font>

01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:44,880
advertised across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet prefix</font>

1905
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,799

prefix filtering to all of our a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

streams to and from our downstreamers

1910
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:57,900
kind of a given so total visibility so

1911
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,830
we talked about all these different

1912
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that we can do to join</font>

1914
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:06,030
harden our network infrastructure we've

01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:07,530
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to secure our</font>

don't accept both bogus routing updates

1918
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:13,679
and things of that nature now what we

1919
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:15,809
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is extend our visibility in</font>

1920
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:18,000
the network and really get an eye for

1921
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:21,090
what's happening on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,350
understand what's normal for our network

01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:25,190
and what's normal for our customers

1924
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:27,870
networks we then have a better chance of

1925
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:29,580
proactively detecting when something

1926

abnormal and potentially bad is

1927
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:35,730
happening so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what to</font>

1988
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:49,740
a form of telemetry that is generated by

1989
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:51,510
routers that provides descriptions of

juniper have an implementation I think

01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:04,560
there's there's the s flow project and a

1996
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,780
couple of min or support and now there's

2010
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:35,699
and so we see a real drop in traffic and

2011
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:37,888
we have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> annotation down there at the</font>

them is very interesting is the graph on

MX record queries like that that stands

2047
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:57,480
out might be indicated that maybe one of

01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:16,980
again we're seeing since back some

2057
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:19,219
traffic spikes so this black graph on

2058
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:21,780
the right shows both inbound and

positive axis the inbound traffic is on

2061
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:29,669
the negative axis and again we see the

with one source of data like net flow or

like BGP that we then go to another form

of telemetry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other sorts of</font>

see a confirmation from two very

about syslog is that as a UDP based

some macro level indicator like net flow

or routing protocol or<font color="#CCCCCC"> SNP no cpu spike</font>

2232
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:22,860
lot of packet capture using TCP dump at

2233
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,600
the command line and then what I do is

2234
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:27,269
once I've done that from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> box somewhere</font>

2235
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:29,850
in the network I then download that

2236
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:32,340
capture information into my my powerbook

2237
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:34,170
here and run ethereal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

2238
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:35,909
use the nice graphical tools they have

so now will you see to continue down in
