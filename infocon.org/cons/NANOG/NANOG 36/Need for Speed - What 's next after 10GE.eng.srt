00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,239
okay so um for people who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who</font>

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,120
I am I run an internet exchange in

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,500
london and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do</font>

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,120
is we're finding that we're needing to

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,799
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more sort of link</font>

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,989
aggregated links and we've been using 10

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,900
gig for ages so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start off</font>

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,750

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,070
could do with the pointer where's the

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,779
points are there we go so this was based

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,559
on looking yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this graph was based</font>

13
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,420
on if i took<font color="#E5E5E5"> my traffic the red curve is</font>

00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:40,260
a polynomial of my traffic growth

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,690
through to the end of 2006 based on

<font color="#E5E5E5">12-month traffic growth which takes me</font>

to about 150 gig from where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am today</font>

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,219
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 80 85 if i took the last</font>

september-october<font color="#CCCCCC"> november december I've</font>

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:02,550
got 300 gig by the end of this year in

22
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:04,019
one metro and so where's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

23
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,880
traffic coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> wells</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,510
buzzwords and were turning up the edge

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,039
speeds and things like that um

26
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,350
applications more people using stuff um

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,450
there's a lot of little packets from

28
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,360
things like VoIP skype all those kind of

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,560
things there's industry consolidation so

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,500
there's fewer of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean we've</font>

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,430
already had we've seen verizon and MCI

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,810
and SBC and AT&T and level 3 and will

33
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,119
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all these people kind of making</font>

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">bigger networks but the fewer of you and</font>

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,960
therefore fewer people with bigger pipes

36
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,189
um so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think back to Seattle um</font>

37
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,689
chapter<font color="#CCCCCC"> enforced n came up and he said</font>

38
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,689
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want you want for donna's</font>

39
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,669
to go and we're an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet shop we make</font>

41
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,680

42
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,439
answer seemed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 because we can</font>

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,680
already do 40 now we've got OC 768 it's

44
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,210
kind of expensive or we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cheap and</font>

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,159
if we're in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metro we can get dark</font>

46
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,789
fiber we can go cheap and we can go for

47
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,979
white angee so so wasting so back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

48
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,950
vendors there don't develop 40 gig it's

49
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,929
a chocolate cattle week<font color="#CCCCCC"> nore do it just</font>

50
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,860
using existing technology do not waste

51
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,430
cash

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,080
time we need something<font color="#E5E5E5"> better um but but</font>

53
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,930
can't we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AG well</font>

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,610
yeah okay but<font color="#E5E5E5"> how far does that scale so</font>

55
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to rate limit and transfer</font>

56
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,240
transfer camp I users and decide what

57
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,400
packets we're going to go and throw on

58
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,810
the floor well maybe not because i

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,640
thought the Internet's idea was to

60
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,830
transmit packets as long as they're okay

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,829
and not check them away and implement

62
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,200
qos throttle things well maybe um but

63
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">either it doesn't scale or for your</font>

64
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,160
network it may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an option you</font>

65
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,230
don't know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the authority</font>

66
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,200
to implement those policies over the

67
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,880
traffic traversing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network or it's</font>

68
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,209
costly and complex it's hard to manage

69
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,980
it takes up a load of op<font color="#CCCCCC"> X time you know</font>

70
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,650
it's a capex versus affects things you

71
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,470
actually build and spend money<font color="#E5E5E5"> on new</font>

72
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,450
stuff and build out or do you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

73
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:05,220
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> money in op X and configuration</font>

74
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,810
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys um it seems to be easier to</font>

75
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,230
over provide I mean that's our

76
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,760
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> of running an exchange point</font>

77
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,619
in that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to get the traffic</font>

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,500
from point A to point B across the

79
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:20,570
exchange fabric as quickly as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can and</font>

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,940
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I found this document from</font>

81
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,290
there was a deposition by Gary<font color="#CCCCCC"> bakula</font>

82
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,920
done if that's how you pronounce his

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,290
name is the VP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet too and it</font>

84
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,100
was a deposition to Congress regarding

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to found out was we're already</font>

87
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,340
doing high bandwidth and enabling all

88
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,080
these applications and we SAT<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,900
we thought about qos and it's actually

90
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier just to simply provide more</font>

91
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,640
bandwidth if it's available um you know

92
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,859
if there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough bandwidth there's no</font>

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,790
congestion and all your bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrive um</font>

94
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,870
as long as you've got the right

95
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,859
technology it's easier to provide I

96
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,820
think you already know we need something

97
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,709
faster than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 gig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and probably 40 we're</font>

98
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,109
already building 8 x 10 gig link out

99
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:13,290
bundles on a single span<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know at least</font>

100
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,079
one network that has got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a city pair</font>

103
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,380
reliably predicting it's going to be

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,420
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> times that within a 12-month</font>

period

106
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,600
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a challenge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

107
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,900
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to do this and if</font>

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,220
you're making large link eggs you've got

109
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,659
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty serious challenges of</font>

110
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,440
handling things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like packet reordering</font>

111
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,150
and and just the physical physical

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,340
capabilities of the box to build link

118
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,310
certain size of link aggregates and

119
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,690
common engineering sense that says that

120
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,520
your backbone needs to be faster than

121
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're attached speed is so if</font>

122
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,690
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got big guys coming to you and</font>

123
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,390
buying 10 gig access lines 10 gig

124
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,580
transit pipes or n by 1 gig transit

125
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:10,830
pipes your backbone has to be multiples

126
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:13,050
of that um so my kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of conclusion is</font>

127
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,729
your vendor needs you probably and even

128
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,250
if they even if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't realize it</font>

129
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,980
yet stand up Ted because I mean he made

130
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,960
the point earlier this<font color="#E5E5E5"> week that a lot</font>

131
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,000
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time stuff being shipped isn't</font>

132
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,710
what we want to buy and it's stuff that

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,730
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just end up having to buy cuz that's</font>

134
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,919
all there is we as the operators need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

135
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,480
go out and say to the vendors this is

136
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,880
what what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need this is</font>

137
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,540
what we're expecting to be doing in 12

138
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,400
months two years three years four years

139
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,169
drive their development process the

140
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,090
problem that we've had is that there's

141
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:46,979
been stagnation in the carrier industry

142
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,969
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendors have gone off</font>

143
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">and said of all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monies and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">moment and the carrier industry isn't</font>

146
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,990
because we've all some of us have been

147
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,340
through chapter 11 and we've written off

148
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">our casts and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not building any</font>

149

more stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> for now and we're not buying</font>

150
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,860
a load of stuff and what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

151
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,690
happen is that there's a there's a real

152
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,669
threat that the technology gap is going

153
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,800
to woken<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and in two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years when we</font>

154
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,919
need to go and build a really big

155
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,330
networks or even less time than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

156
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,710
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there and we go to buy this stuff</font>

157
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,570
and we've got the money<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we've got</font>

158
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,729
the investment to do it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden</font>

159
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">and there's nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't go and buy</font>

160
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:22,080

next<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet standard Ethernet is close</font>

162
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,940
to my heart it's five years out that's

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,540
too late we're done if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years</font>

out give up now apparently the archer

165
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,020
Polly isn't convinced that it needs to

166
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,638
start work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next Ethernet standard</font>

167
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,349
yet

168
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,810

173
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,429
