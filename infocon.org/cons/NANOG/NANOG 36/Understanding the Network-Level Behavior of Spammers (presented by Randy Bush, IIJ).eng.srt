<font color="#E5E5E5">okay they have data collection looking</font>

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:22,380
for spam sources there are two domains

seated the network with addresses at

to find out about them they did DNS

hijacking of the command control to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

a topology and geography of the botnet

of coordinated low bandwidth sending so

43
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:30,569
some of this not as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we think is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">short-lived BGP routing announcements</font>

00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,630
not the botnets or did come from botnets

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,190
but a special sub kit class of them and

47
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,650
that's of course the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that's kind of</font>

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,010
interesting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me so you log the IP</font>

49
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,560
address of the smtp relay and you join

<font color="#E5E5E5">that with the bgp advertisement seen as</font>

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,600
the network edge and this is a fun one

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,580
look at this what's happening is if you

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,380
notice the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oregon paper had these short</font>

54
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:01,709
little prefixes coming out these are / 8

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,780
being announced the / 8 is announced<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

56
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,920
minutes later withdrawn and in that

57
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">period you get hit by spam coming from</font>

58
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:17,010
the empty space in it in other words

6100 8 has addresses allocated in it

60
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:25,798
they bring up the big / 8 and they send

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:28,680
spam from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hold and of course and</font>

62
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,690
that's about it varies between one and

63
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,570
ten percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the spam collected</font>

64
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,660
had this so it's a small club but it's a

65
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:40,859
very persistent club that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

66
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:46,590
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the other pattern you see on</font>

67
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:49,019
this is 82 00 08 is bring it up hit you

68
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,959
with spam bring it right back down<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,959
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up hitch with span and again a / 8</font>

70
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:03,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i turn the call the spectrum</font>

71
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:06,570
agility because it allows the spammer to

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,540
announce the whole / 8 and then have a

73
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,299
whole series of bots bouncing around in

74
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:16,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">the holes in that space and they're very</font>

75
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,630
agile so you'll find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um oh it's not</font>
