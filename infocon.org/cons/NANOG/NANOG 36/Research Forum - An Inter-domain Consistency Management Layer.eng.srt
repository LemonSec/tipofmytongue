1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
for those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> who haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> met me and</font>

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:06,020
my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nate Cushman and I was with</font>

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,010
akamai for a few years and now I'm

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,139
spending most of my time at a little

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,280
school down the street from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font>

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,428
this is joint work with some other

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">people at MIT srikant condo Dina katabi</font>

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,710
and John Witkowski so I'm here to talk

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,350
to you about transient BGP routing loops

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,910
this is opposed to the persistent BGP

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,369
routing loops so you saw yesterday and

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,948
I'm here to convince you both that they

13
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:32,369
matter and that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can do about them so what exactly is</font>

15
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">a transient BGP loop so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take an</font>

16
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,480
example where we've got a couple of tier

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">1 a esas and a couple of regional ISPs</font>

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,050
let's call<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe regional ISP and Bob</font>

19
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,140
regionalize p and then we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an edge</font>

20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,300
network and let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob is a</font>

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,620
customer of Joe just say Joe has some

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,718
connectivity to somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,419
network and so it's worth it to Bob to

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">have Joe as a provider and so let's</font>

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,030
focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> on traffic to MIT from AT&T and</font>

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,768
Joe and<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assume that we want to do</font>

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintenance on the link between Bob and</font>

28
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,500
MIT so as a result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this Bob's going</font>

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,510
to send out a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> withdraw message to</font>

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,460
joe joe is going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> immediately move to</font>

31
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,869
his second best path which is a path

32
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,669
through AT&T and at almost the same time

33
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,909
or withdrawal message is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

34
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,320
sent out to 18 tea and at this point ATT

35
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,600
hasn't yet received the withdrawal

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,820
message from<font color="#CCCCCC"> joe and so as a result of</font>

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,408
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> AT&T is going to route through Joe</font>

38
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,000
and create a routing loop eventually Joe

39
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,610
will send on his withdrawal message to

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,210
AT&T AT&T will move to writing through

41
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,820
sprint and and the routing loop will go

42
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,570
away but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the meantime we've created a</font>

43
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,490
routing loop so that was an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

44
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,589
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a rotting loop but does</font>

45
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,298
that really happen in practice so the

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,070
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous work that I'm aware of in</font>

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,960
looked at packet traces on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sprint</font>

50
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:08,699

<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP feeds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP feeds and packet loss and</font>

various links on their network and what

53
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,650
they found was that ninety percent of

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,629
the packet loss they observed during

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,340
the study up to ninety percent depending

56
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,709
on the trace that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they looked at was</font>

these routing loops between a 60 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100</font>

60
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,769

61
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,420
in the sprint network but is that true

62
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:35,250
in general on the internet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we set up</font>

63
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 different hosts with all of which had</font>

65
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,840
we sent pings once every two minutes to

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,548
70,000 unique prefixes we also traced

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,980
routed each of these prefixes once every

68
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,349
30 minutes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we looked at the TTL</font>

exceeded responses in order to detect

70
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,518
loops and when we did did detect a loop

71
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,930
then we send additional pings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade</font>

74
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,530
correlated between the blend we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

saw a TTL exceeded message indicating a

00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:07,650
routing a loop and what we found is that

78
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:10,019
right around the time of a BGP update

79
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,180
there's a significant increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

amount of routing loops in fact almost

all the routing loops that we saw were

82
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,819
within about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 to 200 second range of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the BGP update and additionally even</font>

84
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,018
more notably ten to fifteen percent of

85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,120
the BGP updates that we saw caused

86
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,069
routing loops this is of all the BGP

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,530
updates we saw across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two month</font>

88
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,690

89
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,739
the 20 hosts ten to fifteen percent of

90
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,299
those updates caused routing loops

91
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,190
however the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't stop here</font>

92
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">because not only the routing loops</font>

93
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,720
caused problems on the destination which

94
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,399
is seen loops they also cause what we

95
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,989
call collateral damage which is

96
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,060
additional congestion on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the links that</font>

97
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,569
are part of the loop causing packet loss

98
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,030
to other destinations give you a quick

99
00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:00,119
example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let's say we've got two</font>

100
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,790
paths one between<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sa nasd and another</font>

101
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,349
between a SE and a SF and let's say one

102
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,060
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these past sees our routing loop and</font>

103
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,668
let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pads are</font>

104
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,060
sharing a link between a SB and a SC and

105
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:15,180
that routing loop traverses<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shared</font>

106
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,139
link at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ratty loop is</font>

107
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,959
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cause additional packet loss on</font>

108
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:25,139
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> link and as a result it's going</font>

109
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,150
to create congestion on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> path between</font>

110
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:32,970
a SE and a SF

111
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:35,460
and we call that collateral damage so

112
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,800
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the actual effect of collateral</font>

113
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,080
damage in practice so in order to

114
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,699
determine this when we saw a routing

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,590
loop we traced route it to that routing

116
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,000
loop and as a result we could tell which

117
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,008
links were a part of that routing loop

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,419
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we did is we looked at all</font>

119
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,520
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other destinations that we were</font>

120
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,870
paying at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time and we looked at</font>

121
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,180
the packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> loss we saw to those</font>

122
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,550
destinations that we're sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> links on</font>

123
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that routing loop and what we found is</font>

124
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,169
that around the time of a link sharing

125
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,600
of sharing a link with a routing loop

126
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,630
there's a market increase in packet loss

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,910
in fact what we found is for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font>

128
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">second window around the time of a link</font>

129
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,080
sharing prefixes sharing a loopy links

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,690
see about nineteen percent packet loss

131
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,280
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> average now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the kind of</font>

132
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,810
problem that's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to debug</font>

133
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,750
very difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you guys to actually</font>

134
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">catch in practice because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you</font>

135
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,039
actually have mechanism set up to detect

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,479
this kind of problem by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time you</font>

recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the routing loop is</font>

138
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,020
causing congestion the loop will have

gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> away and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to actually</font>

140

realize that the congestion you saw as a

<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer is we</font>

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,309
prevent forwarding loops okay duh so how

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,260
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually prevent forwarding loops</font>

145
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,659
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little more closely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

146
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,180
what causes these a loop occurs because

147
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:57,030
one is pushes a route up to the data

148
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,330
plane but other is is not yet aware of

149
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,830
that move try to send packets as if the

150
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,680
packets are being routed on the old

151
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,109
route let's look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the example</font>

152
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,020
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing maintenance</font>

153
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,669
on the link between Bob and MIT as a

154
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:17,490
result<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this Bob sends out a</font>

155
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:18,930
withdrawal message to joe and and as a

156
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,580
result of that withdraw message<font color="#E5E5E5"> joe</font>

157
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,190
immediately moves to his second best

158
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,070
path which is a path through AT&T but at

159
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,979
this point AT&T still believes that Joe

160
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,289
is routing packets through Bob and as a

161
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,360
result of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> when AT&T receives the</font>

162
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,560
withdrawal message it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,450
routing packets through what is

164
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,020
currently it thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> is its second best</font>

165
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,568
path which is the path through Joe

166
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,609
causing the routing loop

167
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:46,319
so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the question what if AT&T</font>

168
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,240
knew about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jones changed what if we were</font>

169
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,099
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell AT&T about Joe's change</font>

170
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,080
before AT&T made its own change before

171
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">we go into that however let me introduce</font>

172
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,020
another concept a concept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we call</font>

173
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:07,199
suspension and what suspension<font color="#CCCCCC"> means is</font>

174
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:09,840
that we continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to route traffic but we</font>

175
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,060
tell the control system not to propagate

176
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,349
the route so what this means is let's

177
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,419
say that i'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to suspend an</font>

178
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,699
interface so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tell the router</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

179
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,349
suspend this interface it continues to

180
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,139
route traffic it could keep the

181
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:24,090
forwarding table as is but it tells<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

182
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,069
to remove the route<font color="#E5E5E5"> from all its</font>

183
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,869
neighbors and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this doesn't affect</font>

184
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,819
the configuration this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a one-time</font>

185
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,289
change that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens only for a period of</font>

186
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,120
time if the router reboots it comes back

187
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:35,849
in its normal configuration we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to screw things up</font>

189
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:41,460
permanently and so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font>

190
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:44,370
how we would use this suspension concept

191
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,930
in our example<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we want to do</font>

192
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintenance between this link between</font>

193
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,319
Bob and MIT but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to know well</font>

194
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,689
before we need to do the maintenance so

195
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,099
as opposed to just pulling the link out

196
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,710
at the point at which<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

197
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,960
lateness we instead suspend the

198
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,969
interface wait for a period of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for</font>

199
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">the traffic to go away and then we pull</font>

200
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:05,270
the link out so we suspend the interface

201
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:07,740
Bob senses<font color="#CCCCCC"> withdrawal message to joe and</font>

202
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,529
now instead of immediately moving away

203
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,210
because the link is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still available Joe</font>

204
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:18,120
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send his update message on</font>

205
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:19,948
to AT&T so in the meantime AT&T is going

206
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,629
to send his withdrawal message to joe

207
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:25,199
sorry bob<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to send them</font>

208
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:27,899
withdrawal message to AT&T and at the

209
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,360
same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> joe is sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his withdraw</font>

210
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:33,479
message on to AT&T even though he's

211
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,669
still routing through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob AT&T will</font>

212
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,649
acknowledge that message indicating that

213
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:40,890
he's processed the update and has

214
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:45,029
already integrated it in at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control</font>

215
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:47,040
level and as a result Joe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at that</font>

216
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:48,779
point then Joe updates his forwarding

217
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,980
table and moved to using a path through

218
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:54,150
AT&T at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> however we can be</font>

219
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,460
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that eight</font>

220
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,590
already knows about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path change and</font>

221
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,500
so when it processes the withdrawal

222
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,480
message it immediately moves to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

223
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,530
path through sprint and as a result

224
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,300
we've avoided the routing loop now this

225
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a simple example to try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

226
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,790
the point across and but more generally

227
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,060
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the kind of thing that</font>

228
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:21,060
academics do we've proven that loops are

229
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,410
prevented in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general case and that</font>

230
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">the convergence properties are very</font>

231
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:29,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar to bgp and if you guys care you</font>

232
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,750
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go look at my web page to find all</font>

233
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,290
sorts of proofs and additional

234
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,910
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this lastly it's worth</font>

235
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,180
noting that this is incrementally

236
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,400
deployable that if you deploy this just

237
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,859
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own network you can avoid ibgp</font>

this on your own network and your

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,890
neighbors deploy it you can devoid I GP

241

247
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,569
ask for feedback from you guys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

248
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,610
shown you this example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a planned</font>

249
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,470
maintenance event<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so fine in the case</font>

250
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,330
of a planned maintenance event the link

251
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,310
is going to continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be up so we're</font>

256
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,390
some time it is worth noting however

257
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,780
that twenty percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp updates are</font>

258
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,340
caused by planned maintenance events

259
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,050
additionally it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> laughable that</font>

260
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can't bring a link up in the current</font>

261
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,939
internet without potentially causing

262
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,260
packet loss in the meantime we can't add

263
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,940
redundancy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the network without</font>

264
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,860
potentially causing a routing loop as a

265
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,390
result of bringing that link up so

266
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,920
clearly this makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run in the</font>

267
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,110
case of a link up event we're willing to

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait a little bit longer to start to use</font>

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,230
that new path that just became<font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font>

routing loops in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meantime however</font>

272
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,480
what's less clear is in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

273
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,950
unplanned link down events<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a link</font>

275
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,800

immediately moving to a backup path and

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,290
potentially causing collateral damage as

a result of that

279
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,060
we're staying on the on the current path

280
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,860
and causing packet loss on that path

281
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,989
until we can be sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we won't cause</font>

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,300
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing loop so I'm looking for</font>

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,779
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the one question that's</font>

305
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:14,939
hidden in your slides is what is the

306
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,160
time domain during which these transient

307
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,260
loops are causing the black holing of

308
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,860
traffic are we talking about black

309
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,360
holing 410 milliseconds while we're

310
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font>

311
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,040
takes longer because the propagation

312
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,720
path is going to take 10 seconds or 20

313
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,269
seconds to make it through the

314
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,060
infrastructure so what you see is that a

315
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:38,670
single loop may only last less than a

316
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,069
second but as the as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the route</font>

317
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,750
propagates through the network many of

318
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:44,880
these loops are created and so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

319
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,949
can see there's kind of from to a

320
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,870
particular destination you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

321
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:50,609
packet loss for as much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 seconds as</font>

322
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,610
a result of that now that's probably not

323
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,500
true in general but the graph that i

324
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,939
showed you shows that the the packet

325
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">loss does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last for a significant period</font>

331
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:14,579
between the myself and the destination

332
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:17,069
meaning as as if the routing between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

333

335
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,880
needs to propagate across to me

336
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,310
be many loops that are created between

338
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,800

than a second many seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay just</font>

341
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,890
talking about introducing additional

342
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,830
state into the routing system in order

343
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,839
to capture this transient state prior to

344
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,839
going to actually withdrawing the route

345
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,339
and and as sort of a side of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

346
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,839
thought you're going a different path I

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,330
thought you were saying the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

348

going to be have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> withdrawal start at</font>

the highest level<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then propagate in</font>

that they're currently being propagated

353
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,980
described is that it does exactly what

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> described is that I send the</font>

356
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,080
the end and then the acknowledgments are

357
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:06,250
going to start to come back and so as

358

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledgment starts to come back</font>

forward across the network which has

when they actually import them and we

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,510
the propagation of information flowing

427
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,229
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where the suspension</font>

428
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:52,050
happens out to the far edge of the

429
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet where the farthest upstream</font>

430
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,800
point acknowledges and then says

431
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,630
everybody downstream<font color="#CCCCCC"> of me it's okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

432
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,900
go ahead and actually change your

433
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:03,210
forwarding information your fibs how do

434
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,920
you know where the far edge of the

435
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is how do you know when the</font>

436
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,380
farthest possible upstream has gotten

437
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,119
the information and he's got no one else

438
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,010
to send it to so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to start</font>

439
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:17,250
upgrading your fibbed back down along

440
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,349
the path so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is that if</font>

441
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm not publishing my path to anyone</font>

442
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,760
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can acknowledge immediately if i</font>

443
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,319
am publishing my path to<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone that i</font>

444
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,450
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait until they acknowledge to</font>

445
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,570
me before I could acknowledge to my to

446
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,370
the to the to the downstream and so as a

447
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,200
result what you do is you send it up

448
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,669
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hit the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys who aren't</font>

449
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,010
publishing the path to anyone till you

450
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,420
hit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge and then the</font>

451
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,070
acknowledgments start coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

452
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,470
through and the withdrawals start

453
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,740
propagating so you're basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

454
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,310
convergence time is now bound by the

455
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,160
slowest pasa

456
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:52,740
router on the farthest most distant

457
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,750
point of the upstream path yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

458
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,250
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> in practice presumably you need to</font>

459
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,380
set some timers on this to make sure

460
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,900
that you don't you know get stuck in a

461
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad case like that obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in theory</font>

462
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,860
it sounds nice but in practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it's</font>

463
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,720
going to require some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of timer in</font>

464
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,580
order to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't get stuck</font>

465
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,610
in exactly that's no more like cake I'm

466
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,780
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait five seconds and if i</font>

467
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,000
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear back i'm going to go ahead</font>

468
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,000
and update my fit anyway exactly thanks

469
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok hi veranda with river domain you</font>

470
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,610
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> lovelies a suspension feature</font>

471
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">as that you've taken the interface in a</font>

472
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:32,429
passive mode what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean by</font>

473
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">passively not propagating route so you</font>

474
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,900
accepting routes exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're just</font>

475
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,850
your you your routing packets normally

476
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:42,770
but you're not propagating in those ruts

477
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,770
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright thanks</font>
