1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:06,060
hello I'll be describing a tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,219
we've been developing for about a year

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,079
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now this was work done with a</font>

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,639
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really good undergraduate</font>

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,469
students that we had John he's in the

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,259
audience right here was one of the main

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,230
developers and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> person like he's</font>

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,000
now gainfully employed so what I'll be

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,820
talking about today is very quickly

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,609
going over what flamingo is what are the

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,400
visualizations that we implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bill</font>

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,900
alluded to the data is complex it has a

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,969
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things that you can</font>

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about so our approach to this is</font>

15
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,390
not to cram everything into a single

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,120
display but to do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> series of displays</font>

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,730
which and then provide the<font color="#CCCCCC"> user with the</font>

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,099
tools of soft agha lling between these

19
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,069
displays and toggling and selecting what

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,840
information he wants to view in an

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,160
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get at the information that</font>

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,149
they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to extract from this</font>

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,860
raw data towards the end I'll zip very

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,360
quickly through some<font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshots of some</font>

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,670
case studies that we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,239
network since we've been using this tool

27
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:07,260
and we can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into more details</font>

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,380
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> buf like Todd mentioned so what</font>

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">is flamingos flamingos tool enables you</font>

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,960
to navigate or explore your net flow

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,570
data in a 3d visualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's OpenGL</font>

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,089
based but it's also a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool so</font>

33
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,158
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a 10-second interval over which</font>

34
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,990
it will collect net flows and do some

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,790
aggregation and then push the data out

36
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the visualization client that</font>

37
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,189
interval can be changed to be whatever

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,210
you want it to be so what we do is we

39
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,339
provide series of different

40
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,579
visualizations it's all based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,590
flow we're not doing any external

42
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:44,750
intelligence building on top of the net

43
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,369
flow it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what net flow contains um and</font>

44
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,020
then we add on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools and the filters</font>

45
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,780
to let let you select which what

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,130
information you're visualizing here's

47
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,899
the architecture it's a client-server

48
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:00,030
architecture you don't have to modify

49
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:02,460
your net flow generators in any way all

50
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,290
you have to do is point them to export

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">your net flow to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Flamingo server the</font>

52
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">Flamingo server is then going to</font>

53
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">aggregate those net flow flows into bgp</font>

54
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">bens prefix bins and then export</font>

55
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,409
the the aggregations out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Flamingo</font>

56
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,239
clients you can have multiple people

57
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,920
connected to the same server they can be

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,030
looking at different views they're

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,108
completely decoupled from each other

60
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,569
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different visualization</font>

61
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:31,849
methods that we use Evan cook at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

62
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:34,369
University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Michigan mentioned the</font>

63
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:36,319
quadtree algorithm briefly yesterday at

64
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,489
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seckbach some of you might not</font>

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been there so I'll describe that</font>

66
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:43,579
briefly again the we implement five

67
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,099
different views<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same traffic we</font>

68
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:49,340
implement traffic volume by source and

69
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,560
destination IP traffic volume by a s you

70
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,919
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at traffic distribution across</font>

71
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,569
ports and of course you know the final

72
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">two are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most important that we found</font>

73
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,250
in our usage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tool which is flows</font>

74
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,879
between sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> and destinations and</font>

75
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,139
then sort and then traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> flows between</font>

76
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:10,819
source destination source port and

77
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:12,230
destination IP and destination port so

78
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,790
here's the part tree algorithm what it

79
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,418
basically does is it allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

80
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:20,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">represent a 32-bit IP address into a</font>

81
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:21,470
fixed size space what you do is suppose

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,470
you have you start off<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a big square</font>

83
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,299
you draw two lines divided into

84
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,879
quadrants what you can now do is he have

85
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,729
four areas which can represent by two

86
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,858
bits to binary bits if you repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

87
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:36,620
algorithm as you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the bottom right</font>

88
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:38,180
here you can further you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can repeat the</font>

89
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,669
algorithm and now you can represent four

90
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:45,139
bits repeat the 16 times and now you can

91
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:49,340
represent a 32-bit IP address so we

92
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:51,010
apply that in so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a 2d mapping</font>

93
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,000
what we now do is we take this

94
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-dimensional representation of an IP</font>

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,079
address converted into a

96
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,179
three-dimensional figure and we have one

97
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:03,199
axis of freedom which we can now use to

98
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,299
represent additional information<font color="#CCCCCC"> in so</font>

99
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,379
what do we do in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first view that I'm</font>

100
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,739
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this is the basic</font>

101
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:11,959
view what we do is on the base of the

102
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,449
cube we represent<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quadtree algorithm</font>

103
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,789
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> represent information from the BGP</font>

104
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,500
routing table and then on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> z axis</font>

105
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:21,139
what we can do is we can represent

106
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,150
volume of traffic for each of those bgp

107
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:25,669
prefixes we use a different color for

108
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">each prefix and therefore you can see</font>

109
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:31,340
relative volumes

110
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:33,560
of what traffic is in terms of source<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP</font>

111
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,698
<font color="#CCCCCC">s or destination IP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s in your that is</font>

112
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">being represented in the net flow</font>

113
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,319
records on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network here's what the</font>

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,779
figure looks like this is a 10-second

115
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:44,150
snapshot of traffic across one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

116
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:46,400
routers the base of the cube<font color="#E5E5E5"> is showing</font>

117
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,628
you the IP address space different

118
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">colors are representing different</font>

119
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:52,039
prefixes for example this big purple bar

120
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,219
over here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a / 8 this blue bar over</font>

121
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:59,029
here is a / 16 the volume<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the z</font>

122
00:04:55,219 --> 00:05:05,409
axis and you can see volumes vary across

123
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:08,569
prefixes and I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

124
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:10,099
filtering capabilities of this later on

125
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,080
I'll go through the visualizations first

126
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:14,949
the second visualization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'll talk</font>

127
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">about is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the source destination IP flows</font>

128
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:19,939
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we have just basically what</font>

129
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:23,270
we want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it what we want to</font>

130
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:25,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe in this visualization is how</font>

131
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,979
which sources are going to which

132
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:29,839
destinations so the way now what we have

133
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we have to represent two 32-bit</font>

134
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,250
numbers and the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around this</font>

135
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:36,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is by using two surfaces of a</font>

136
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">cube and then representing the source on</font>

137
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,969
one surface the destination on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

138
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:44,300
surface and drawing lines between the

139
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:47,509
source and the destination planes thus

140
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,430
the thickness of the line is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> scaled</font>

141
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,479
to represent the relative magnitude of

142
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,219
the flow so you can quickly identify

143
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,289
which are the big flows in which are the

144
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:56,899
small flows and here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

145
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,909
representation looks like we have source

146
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:01,279
IP addresses on the left they are being

147
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:03,589
aggregated by bgp prefixes we have

148
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:07,339
destination IP addresses on the right

149
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:09,110
again by the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> DGP table and what</font>

150
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,520
we're doing is drawing lines between the

151
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,259
source and the destination so you can

152
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,508
see where your traffic is coming from

153
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:18,620
and where it's going to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

154
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,750
visualization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want to talk about</font>

155
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,099
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we incorporate port level</font>

156
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,750
information in this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow</font>

157
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">contains source and destination ports as</font>

158
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,129
well what we do in this is slightly

159
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,830
different than the two views that you've

160
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:32,659
seen so far in the the first view what

161
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">you saw was the base of the key was used</font>

162
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,860
to represent the IP address space and

163
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the z axis or the height was used</font>

164
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,030
to represent volume we only have 11

165
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,770
a degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> of freedom left the z-axis so</font>

166
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,500
what we do is we overload the meaning in

167
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,719
this visualization we represent the pork

168
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,460
level information on the z-axis not

169
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,340
volumes but the port level information

170
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,799
is on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> z-axis so what what happens</font>

171
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,289
right now in this scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you end up</font>

172
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,270
with source<font color="#CCCCCC"> ip's source IP source port</font>

do all the visualizations examples that

235
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,430
I've shown you so far have focused on

236
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,250
using the entire 32-bit address space

237
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,689
but a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

address space they only have a / 24 / 16

240
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,500
so what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is you can specify</font>

241
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,689
your source and your destination ranges

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're graphing or visualizing and</font>

recently which proved to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very useful</font>

247
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,060
in in illustrating how the visualization

248
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,360
technique helps you extract information

249
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,699
from raw data so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a traffic anomaly was</font>

250
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,790
reported on October sixteenth and there

251
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,220
was a large burst of traffic from one of

252
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,819
the hosts at the University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Michigan</font>

253
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,380
it was it lasted roughly six hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

254
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,910
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a single source IP source</font>

255
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:18,490
port but there were about four<font color="#E5E5E5"> targets</font>

256
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,380
not widely distributed we could tell

257
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,240
from using<font color="#CCCCCC"> flamingo that there were UDP</font>

258
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,460
flows what ports that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were going to what</font>

259
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,290
those IP addresses were and more

260
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,910
importantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what was</font>

261
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,699
interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> note that this anomalous</font>

262
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,640
traffic was actually visible in your

263
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,970
normal view so when you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font>

264
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,260
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a day-to-day basis using this</font>

265
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,760
visualization technique you see a

266
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,650
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern that you see day-to-day</font>

267
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,840
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when this anomaly happened that</font>

268
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,390
changed and that was identifiable using

269
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,520
the visualization here's what that

270
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">looked like so what you're seeing over</font>

271
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,460
here is once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 10-second snapshot</font>

272
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">of traffic going across the router and</font>

273
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,700
all of a sudden what you're seeing is a

274
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,040
strange blue triangle right in the

275
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,810
middle now that's not normal what this

276
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,880
is representing is that there's a single

277
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">source and he's hitting a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

278
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination ports at some destination</font>

279
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:09,999
and this is a single source you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell</font>

280
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,728
<font color="#CCCCCC">that because he's using the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same color</font>

281
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:14,019
now that leads you to believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

282
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:16,929
there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting going on</font>

283
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:19,149
here so now you look at the next view

284
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:20,679
which is you zoom in a little bit to

285
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,049
focus your attention on where that

286
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,059
traffic is coming from what in this

287
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:28,269
visualization weird what we're showing

288
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:33,399
is the the source volume from individual

289

hosts individual 32-bit hosts from a /

290
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,839
24 address space that we identified as

originating the traffic what we're

292
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,399
seeing over here is the sheer large

293
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,319
volume of the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flows that a</font>

294
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,329
single host was generating close to

295
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:48,339
roughly four<font color="#E5E5E5"> million flows in about five</font>

298
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:54,099
are almost negligible in terms of

00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:55,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic so once again illustrating very</font>

300
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:58,299
clearly that somebody is doing something

301
00:11:55,569 --> 00:12:00,699
strange so now we go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source and</font>

302
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:02,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination flows to see well we know</font>

303
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,909
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of traffic where is it</font>

304
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:05,849
coming from where's it going this is

305
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:09,099
where the the source destination IP

306
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:12,069
visualization helps us out we we can

307
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:15,279
tell that we have a single unique source

308
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:18,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">he his destinations are plotted clearly</font>

309
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,469
as two or three distinct targets in the

310
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:23,139
destination plane and we can spot the IP

311
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:25,629
addresses very clear the lines are very

312
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:27,909
thick which means once again lots of

<font color="#E5E5E5">volume what about in terms of port</font>

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:57,819
it's the green fan-shaped entity over

358
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:16,179

370
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,490
and that's traffic volume flow in terms

00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,319
of the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of flows in source and</font>

372
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,049

00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:53,229
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or three flows per minute and</font>

extremely large number here's here's an

00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:00,819
interesting representation of what

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,949
scanning events warm scans or

378
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:04,929

381
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:11,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">identify a infected host and then we</font>

382
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,290
plotted outgoing traffic from that

383
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,179
infected host in terms of what where his

384
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,790
infection attempts was it sequential

385
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:21,569
random and what you're looking over here

386
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,439
is essentially a random connection

387
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:25,360
random connection attempts he's

388
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:27,849
attempting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect to random hosts</font>

389
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,040
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the destination is distributed</font>

390
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:34,420
fairly evenly across the 32-bit IP space

391
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,860
it's all originating from one saw

392
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,479
that's why you end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cone</font>

393
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,100
shape the cone shape is also

394
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,290
illustrating because the source ports

395
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,320
are higher and the destination target

396
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,430
boats are essentially port 445 they're

397
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,750
all the same so it's basically

398
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,120
attempting to connect to different

399
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,519
random IP addresses but all on the same

400
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,370
destination port and that's giving that

401
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,440
this cone-shaped visualization this is

402
00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:00,070

probably peer-to-peer what it's showing
