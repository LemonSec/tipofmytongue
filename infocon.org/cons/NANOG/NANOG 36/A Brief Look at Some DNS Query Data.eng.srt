1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
okay okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull up the</font>

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,760
slides on this one it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little</font>

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:10,320
bit hard to see from that the a reload

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,309
the agenda if you can't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides</font>

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,969
they should be there on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web page</font>

6
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,130
right yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically some fun</font>

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,900
with new plot looking at some data that

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,189
most of you I'm guessing probably do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,310
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of us look at the traffic</font>

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,350
flows and statistics on interfaces but

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,570
you but you probably also run DNS but

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,380
you're probably not looking at that data

13
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I think it's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,019
interesting to look at and I know

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,269
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some issues some of you have</font>

16
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually looking at it but even looking</font>

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">at something that may be seemingly not</font>

18
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,690
interesting turns out and my opinion

19
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,879
actually be somewhat interesting so what

20
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're looking at here and what the</font>

21
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,129
graph will be similar on all the pages

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,680
are on the x-axis is a source port used

23
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,140
by a client querier to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS server and</font>

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,690
on the y-axis is the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">that source port was actually used so</font>

26
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,670
all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of clustering looks like</font>

27
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,519
there's overlap there's only actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11</font>

28
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,229
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> / coordinate okay so what you're</font>

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at on this page is a recursive</font>

30
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,010
server that's both authoritative four

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,869
zones within a<font color="#E5E5E5"> institution that's</font>

32
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,750
responsible for as well as being

33
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,159
recursive generally for domains outside

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,350
the institution so it's an open

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,729
recursive server also so clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside</font>

36
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,000
of the institution use this I know

37
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:28,470
that's bad but in any case so what you

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,579
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a long up kind of a point to this</font>

39
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,259
work on the on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> left the screen up</font>

40
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,889
above you'll see there's like a

41
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,140
saxophone kind of pattern here and it

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,790
kind of goes down into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right what</font>

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,100
that is indicating is starting at about

44
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 24's clients using that port and</font>

45
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,210
they become less popular as they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

46
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,770
the right and so clients windows in this

47
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,309
case that's what that cluster represents

48
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,890
tend to start using source ports at 1024

49
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,469
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 25</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is usually the most</font>

50
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">popular and then you see a complete fall</font>

51
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,070
off because<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows kind of wraps at</font>

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">5,000 starts over again if you see a</font>

53
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,059
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a similar pattern over way</font>

54
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,979
over on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where some unix</font>

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,509
system start and then there's a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

56
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,840
a big gap in the middle and then you see

57
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,799
below<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1024 there's a lot of white space</font>

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,330
so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this there's an</font>

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">eh pattern it's not a big cluster all</font>

60
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,660
over the place and so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the really</font>

61
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,359
interesting patterns that you that i

62
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,000
found that weren't totally obvious was

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,580
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,060
right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the high</font>

65
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,530
ones just to the left that is port 137

66
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,660
guess what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that's windows stuff</font>

67
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,420
and pretty much all of that is like

68
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">windows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name lookups that are all bogus</font>

69
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:42,350
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up towards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right you see</font>

70
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,970
this right up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's port 53 53</font>

71
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,549
which you may think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

72
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,840
hard coding their servers to use that as

73
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,540
a source port but no that actually turns

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,160
out to be this multicast DNS stuff which

75
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,060
I'm not really sure what it is but Maxie

76
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,920
is it and you see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over the</font>

77
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,900
place those<font color="#E5E5E5"> also all bogus as far as I</font>

78
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,660
can tell and then you see a few other

79
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,010
points here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that are outliers</font>

80
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,240
and some of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are interesting when</font>

81
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,579
you start to get into the data it might

82
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,770
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> hostetter misconfigured or maybe</font>

83
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's infected with some kind</font>

84
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,740
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bots that's querying for name over</font>

85
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,320
and over again and not getting

86
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,110
resolution on that name<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

87
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,239
one institution server I have three

88
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,950
others there's this is another

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,830
institution the graphs are very similar

90
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,510
across all institutions and I'm told by

91
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,730
someone who's done this sort of analysis

92
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,320
on traffic flows the graphs are similar

93
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,238
although I'd like to check for myself

94
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,090
because I'm not sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe that</font>

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,850
in all cases here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one this is</font>

96
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,110
a large<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP again the stronger</font>

97
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,480
clustering there in that middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> Valley</font>

98
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,430
but the graphs again still similar you

99
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,738
see the pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> with port 53 is</font>

100
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:48,330
obviously real high that's up on top up

101
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:51,750
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see 137 again and 53 53</font>

102
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:56,310
also and finally another institution

103
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:59,100
again very similar and<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is if you</font>

104
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,570
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> out all the external queers for one</font>

105
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,130
of those graphs here's what the graph

106
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,900
looks like it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change too much</font>

107
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,329
but you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a lot of</font>

108
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,070
white space now below 1024 and so what

109
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,530
what that ends up telling you<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all</font>

110
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">those points that were there before were</font>

111
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,450
actually appeared to be from machines

112
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,040
behind NAT Pat boxes that were actually

113
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,409
ended up using those little<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbered</font>

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">courts okay and you also see some other</font>

115
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,760
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of stick out and so you</font>

116
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,370
might wonder under<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font>

117
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,730
saxophone picture what's what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

118
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,170
point right there why isn't that

119
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,450
really used and so when you dig until

120
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,250
you find out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> support 1900 which is</font>

121
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play port which most</font>

122
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows machines have enabled so they</font>

123
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,590
can't actually use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that port so you find</font>

124
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:43,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's that's one that doesn't</font>

125
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:45,369
bubble up on the graph going to verse

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">direction here's what just external</font>

127
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,520
queers look like again very similar in

128
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">this case you do see some additional</font>

129
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,299
outliers that might be interesting that

130
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,710
you might look at and here's if you were

131
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to look at the point of queries for</font>

132
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,909
all internal recursive as well as

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,600
authoritative inside and outside you

134
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,830
don't see the elbow shape on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1024</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

135
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">5000 which I guess is kind of</font>

136
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:14,440
interesting you do see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5353 stand</font>

137
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,450
out right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's that</font>

138
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,210
multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> dnf stuff that's all pointer</font>

139
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:22,630
queries and that's a lot and that's all

140
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:28,299
bogus as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell here's MX</font>

141
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:32,500
only queries and interesting to me this

142
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,480
looks like the quad a stuff it's

143
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,730
relatively clean there's not a lot of

144
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,550
outliers here in there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit but</font>

145
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">not that much okay now a lot of these</font>

146
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:46,540
are probably bogus queries anyways but

147
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,430
nonetheless here's a these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all 24</font>

148
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,690
hours by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way here's a picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

149
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,030
windows machine that was really doing

150
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,250
pretty much nothing else but trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

151
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,859
contact an IRC server and there's really

152
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,350
only three points there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one way on the</font>

153
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,490
left over here there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here and</font>

154
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,110
then there's one down there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

155
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,030
only like one or two queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what</font>

156
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was doing the first point on the</font>

157
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,450
left it was querying over and over for a

158
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,090
name and then something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened like</font>

159
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,950
some automatic virus software that

160
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,479
wasn't working<font color="#E5E5E5"> started up and then it</font>

161
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,920
actually changed ports and went to that

162
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,570
other one and queried from that source

163
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,730
for over and over again I don't quite

164
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,110
understand how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually worked but</font>

165
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,300
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind of interesting I</font>

166
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,220
don't know if that's indicative to how

167
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots on Windows host to work generally</font>

168
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,720
but I thought I point that out here's a

169
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,950
UNIX machine that was infected with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">bot this one actually just behaved</font>

171
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,310
differently and this is probably what

172
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,710
you would expect you would expect to see

173
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,600
the port range is pretty equally used so

174
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,799
if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to do analysis on this</font>

175
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bots that might not actually</font>

176
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,960
work is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might</font>

177
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look normal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you see the ones</font>

178
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,469
above that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably just</font>

179
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:49,340
retransmissions not getting an answer

180
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:52,039
for a query and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

181
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">just another plot of a unix server that</font>

182
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:56,509
does a whole bunch of stuff from ssh to

183
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,750
web server to mail and other things and

184
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,550
so remember again that even though this

185
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,440
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solid line all the way</font>

186
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,669
across if you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> to blow this up</font>

187
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,250
there's actually holes in that and so

188
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:12,680
these actually fill in port numbers in

189
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:14,660
between there somewhere so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

190
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,949
next step in doing this sort of analysis

191
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,120
is just by looking at source ports

192
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,789
that's kind of interesting what other

193
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,780
things in DNS can you look at to get

194
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:23,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">even more interesting information</font>

195
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,280
there's a lot there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more to look</font>

196
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">at than source port there's not only the</font>

197
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,309
question but the answer that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

198
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,680
back and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the answer like</font>

199
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,050
the TTL and the the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address or IP</font>

200
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,310
addresses that you might get back so the

201
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 minute lightning talk I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

202
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,169
was enough to start with so that's
