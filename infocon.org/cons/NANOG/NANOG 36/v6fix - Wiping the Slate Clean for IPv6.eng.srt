the specific programs and here here we

are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the big picture of the</font>

to understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> the macro level status of</font>

127
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,650
the ipv6 deployment and we are using two

128
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,960
different technologies the first one is

129
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,240
a wider<font color="#CCCCCC"> area measurement over behaviors</font>

130
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,270
of the second level and subtly will be

131
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:14,010
in his service and is and the second

132
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:18,689
measurement is comparative path analysis

133
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:21,030
with ipv4 and ipv6 your stack so<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

134
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:24,000
the results from dns server measurements

135

156
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,490
so the percentage is small but still

157
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:59,290
these servers are out there and people

158
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:01,270
if when people are using ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users</font>

are sometimes encounter these problems

and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk the second</font>

162
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:17,320

measurement techniques specifically

164
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,840
designed for George type measurement so

165
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take measurement for both</font>

166
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:29,680

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:33,130
compare basics result with be full

168
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,670
results and extract programs that exist

169
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:40,900

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,140
using the tunnels so we're using

net result and the right graph is from

198
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:36,800
taken from ISC so if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITV is 630 did</font>

around the unity rhyme but if the

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,020
individual nodes are protein fob of the

202
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:51,140
unity line it means basically d fishes

203
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:54,650
and if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a cluster of the unity</font>

204

207

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,099
the backbone

209
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:15,740
so this is hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see but I'll we</font>

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:20,439

212
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:29,930
to visualize path and empty use so edges

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:35,420
are colored by MTU blue lines are

214
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:39,319
basically empty you less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 1,500 so</font>

215
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:45,530
it means toenails and nose are colored

216

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> nicer net to our insights so so</font>

218
00:15:51,650 --> 00:16:01,850
many sites from<font color="#CCCCCC"> nitronic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insights</font>

are going through Japan so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

220
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:09,020
typical problem of a lack of tunnels and

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:13,819
this this this is what we we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

222
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:19,460
left glove so lots of title when you're

using ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> passage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically are going</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is problem i accede to</font>

225
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:33,709
our insights so<font color="#CCCCCC"> path looks much better</font>

226
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,620
but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of blue edges that</font>

227
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:41,390
means there are lots of tunnels still

228
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:43,790
out there so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> abilene case are in</font>

229
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> National results a very known</font>

230
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:52,670
problem so everything has been trying to

231
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:56,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">encourage ipv6 adoption and there are no</font>

232
00:16:52,670 --> 00:17:01,520
a UPS or they provide a tornado services

233
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:06,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">who ipv6 but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> abilene ended up with</font>

234
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:11,949
horrible ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass mostly is tunnels</font>

235
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,949
because many I HP is appearing with a

236
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:19,030
Abilene and they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to move</font>

237
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,960
to paid ipv6

238
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:26,470
connectivity so I had currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> Abilene</font>

239
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:31,390
is thinking about suspending its<font color="#E5E5E5"> relaxed</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">AUP for ipv6 to encourage ISPs to move</font>

241
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:38,320
to in a commercial ipv6 connectivity so

242
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,260
our tour is used to illustrate such

243
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,340
issues and we are hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know</font>

244
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:51,010
help convince operators to move to

245
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:53,730
better ipv6 environment so this one is

246
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:57,220
the example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> jurors that trace route</font>

247
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:01,750

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">abilene we plot neighboring the sides</font>

quoted in this video temp targets are

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:23,680
plotted and we we put before path and be

252
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:26,980
six paths in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same graph so in this</font>

253
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:30,160
crust in this graph they have a

254
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,250
similarity<font color="#CCCCCC"> give our hopes of ipv4 and</font>

255
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,990
ipv6 and basically it's our native

256
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:43,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">joystiq pass from white debris so this</font>

257
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an example of a commercial path so</font>

258
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently commercial paths are basically</font>

259
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:52,680
they're using completely different

260
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:55,960
routing for v4 and v6 so this will have

261
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,420
similarity but different<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths this is</font>

262
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:04,510
very common in the current b6 deployment

263
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:09,910
and this one is the example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 has</font>

264
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:12,580
much larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT than ipv4 they are</font>

265
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:18,060
basically around about<font color="#CCCCCC"> roundabout</font>

266
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:22,510
tunnels so basics takes much longer to

267
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:27,179
reach the target so to conclude they

268
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:32,200
allow only few misbehaving our nose

269
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:33,510
deployed in the ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> network but often</font>

270
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,300
they

271
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:43,780
programs that combine combine<font color="#E5E5E5"> programs</font>

272
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:46,899
combinatorial and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem could be</font>

273
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,810
fatal to acceptance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a previous six so</font>

274
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,930
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to list a specific</font>

and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a big</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">picture and try to promote adoption of</font>

278
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:06,429
ipv6 and the important thing we realize

279
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:12,370
is to share information among different

280
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:14,070
groups and and especially we need a

281
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:19,659
cooperation among researchers

282
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:24,879
implementers and operators so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

283
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:28,360
we should act now and otherwise you know

284
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:34,770
this problem could be very problematic

285
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:39,879
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 deployment so here we list our</font>
