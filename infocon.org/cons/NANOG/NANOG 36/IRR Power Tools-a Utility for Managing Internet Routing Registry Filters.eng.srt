have put what prefix filtering is I was

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,800
kind of surprised with a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

to be some form of filtering in place if

31
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,909
you don't filter your customers at all I

are are filtering is better than manual

filtering number one manual filtering

57
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:42,609
takes a lot of time you you know it

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't seem like much when you've got a</font>

small<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and you've got a couple</font>

61
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:49,959
of routes but by the time you're a huge

62
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,269
network with with thousands of routes

63
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,010
and hundreds of customers speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

64
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:57,370
you're going to have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

65
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:00,790
spending time going through making

updates verifying updates typing things

67
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,400
out manual update process is very slow

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,439
and if you've ever had to wait for

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">someone to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around and process an</font>

sometimes people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in four hours</font>

sometimes they do in 48 hours sometimes

they're gone for the weekend sometimes

they not to name any names but sometimes

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,479
they change their<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp at aes so that it</font>

forwards to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where for five days and</font>

77
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:33,220
don't notice it's a slow process

78
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:34,690
especially true if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a customer</font>

83
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:49,750
basis someone misses a decimal place off

84
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:51,459
by 12 typos and number while there while

85
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,930
they're preparing things even if they

86
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,209
use scripts and they're cut and pasting

87
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,010
and a missile line suddenly you've got a

88
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,870
prefix that's not being accepted that's

89
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,870
not being routed that can be an outage

90
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:07,479
or you're allowing prefixes you

91
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:09,669
shouldn't be and bad things happen like

92
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:12,060
I said filtering small customers is easy

93
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:15,040
filtering large customers not so much

94
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,839
what a lot of people tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is once</font>

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,459
a customer reaches a certain size they

96
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,190
just kind of assume that okay maybe

97
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,510
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough now</font>

98
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,540
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> that size maybe be at five</font>

99
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,820
hundred a thousand five thousand

100
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily a safe assumption</font>

101
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:34,700
to make there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people that</font>

102
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,700
want to use irr in a more reliable basis

103
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,479
obviously we've already seen that

104
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,340
filtering peers is more work than

105
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,890
anyone's willing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially for</font>

106
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,859
large peers yeah I know there's some

107
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,840
some lists on some exchanges where

108
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,220
people will will send to the list I'm

109
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,349
going to announce the new prefix today

110
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,940
everyone please update your filters but

111
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,050
most of the time that doesn't happen

112
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't scale just doesn't work and</font>

113
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously it's only going to get worse</font>

114
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:07,590
from here routing table continues to

115
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:09,330
grow now is the time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it so why</font>

116
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,780
doesn't everyone use IR are a lot of

117
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:15,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">people actually do European</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> juice is</font>

118
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,059
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost total and you know I</font>

119
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:22,650
talked to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a bunch of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about why</font>

120
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:26,490
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they seem to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

121
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,840
you know every provider is just it's

122
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:33,120
accepted at this point every provider

123
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:36,380
requires it the ripe really supports it

124
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,600
along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registration policy so</font>

125
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,300
it's accepted<font color="#E5E5E5"> commonplace there in the</font>

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:52,290
you call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> today level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 sabes and then</font>

129
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:58,770
there's the list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't</font>

130
00:05:52,290 --> 00:06:01,680
use it or some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them have an irr entry</font>

131
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:05,190
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong like na s set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that just</font>

134
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:14,850
autumn record there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of confusion</font>

135
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,860
going on out there so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

136
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,820
trying to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out why people didn't</font>

137
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,100
use it probably the biggest answer is

138
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,990
that it was too complex they said for

139
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,660
everyone bgp speaking customer who uses

140
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">IRR there's 50 who have no hope of</font>

141
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,650
figuring it out and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

142
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,350
rocket science it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not well</font>

143
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,659

yep also most networks are not

00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:40,110
you have a complete list in some some

don't get it and when a customer doesn't

proxy register you so anything they see

179
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,919
in BGP they register which is

180
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,780
counterproductive to filtering<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp this</font>

181
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,460
also ends up polluting the databases

182
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,229
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people who proxy</font>

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,000
register for others that they shouldn't

00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,530
there's people who proxy register

existing entries that don't know what's

186

going on and since they're in the

maintainer you can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of their</font>

188
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,260

registering stuff in your space and also

191
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,120
that the existing tools were not

sufficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually deploy our</font>

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:46,770
basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can fix at least here</font>

195
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:48,960
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I rode this tool to help automate all</font>

196
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,649
the things that you actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,629
to deploy

198

almost exactly like various<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

206
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,670
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only so much you can do with</font>

207
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,980
this but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the only public tool</font>

208
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,709
that I know of that's available which is

209
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">why I decided to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it available so</font>

210
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:22,559
the steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are required you need to</font>

211
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:25,800
retrieve the prefixes on a regular basis

00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,389
be it hourly by daily daily however you

213
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,910
choose to do it there's an automated

214
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:31,499
fetching process where you have a list

things that you do not want people to be

220
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,420
able to register an announced and that's

221
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:48,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">just good practice you know you may have</font>

225
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:58,399
it now before they even<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

231
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,910
recording of prefix changes does this

via CBS which may or may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

out when they remove the route there's

our base you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just hand them your object</font>

if you've got a transit provider who

255
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,290
isn't you can put them in the knack

256

system and it will translate your

257

changes to standard email and send it

your database so you don't have to do

00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,940
that manually and it also generates

IRR it does not address every feature

269
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,560
you can possibly imagine it doesn't

270
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,060
handle import and export policies at all

271
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,010
which by definition means it won't do is

272
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,680
pass filters or well but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to them</font>

273
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:55,860
right it doesn't deal with filters that

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,180
compile it whatever is going on I don't

285
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,970
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was difficult and we</font>

286
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually experienced some problems we</font>

287
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">were trying to deploy it we had to make</font>

288
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:37,260
configuration changes in order to get it

289
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,460
to compile a freebsd the the binary

290
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,319
images wouldn't run on the latest

291
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,220
operating system and there were some

292
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,610
versions of code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're actually</font>

293
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:47,010
pulling down incorrect answers so we

294
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,500
ended up rewriting it to not use it it

295
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:52,350
wasn't a critical piece of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

296
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:57,270
ended up doing the queries so we just

297
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,830
wrote around that it builds upon the

298
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,990
queries and adds all the features<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

299
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:05,670
you need to actually use irr in

300
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:09,930
production so some example usage there's

301
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,459
a database file that contains an<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn a</font>

302
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,099
customer object and

303
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:18,388
a email for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer to let them</font>

304
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what's going on were they when they</font>

305
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:22,889
got an update there's an exclusions file

306
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,230
that lists bogans you can pull that<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

307
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:27,509
from from many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of publicly available</font>

308
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,209
sources there's a general configuration

309
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:33,660
file and there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ag configuration</font>

310
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:36,209
file for talking to transit providers so

311
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,969
here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of a run of the fetch</font>

312
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:43,248
process where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just runs through pulls</font>

313
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:47,540
out the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> adds it in CVS there's a</font>

314
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:47,540
aggregated and non aggregated version

315
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:53,269
here's an example of the database that's

316
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:56,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">stored it's flat files for right now so</font>

317
00:13:53,269 --> 00:14:00,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can adapt other tools to do things</font>

318
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:02,910
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you can see the value of</font>

319
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:05,730
aggregating even when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

320
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,139
they're aggregating already if you're

321
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,029
going to deploy things in the routers

322
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,939
which is my policy personally is to

323
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:13,559
deploy them with up to 24 so that people

324
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:16,439
are allowed to announce more specifics

325
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:22,110
as needed without<font color="#CCCCCC"> having to call the NOC</font>

326
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:24,089
and say hey I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it reduces</font>

327
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,910
the complexity of the config that needs

328
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:30,779
to go on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers I believe Todd and</font>

329
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,368
Tom and a couple of people addressed

330
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:35,160
this at the last night with a

331
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:37,619
presentation on how far routers would

332
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,540
scale to handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> any large prefix lists</font>

333
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:42,240
and some of the answers weren't that

334
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,339
good so it helps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to aggravate</font>

335
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data as much as possible you can</font>

336
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:50,009
also turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the accepting up you can</font>

337
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:53,279
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> off accepting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more specifics and it</font>

338
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:59,369
will still aggregate down unnecessary

339
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:04,379
routes so here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

340
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:07,920
English version of the output not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

341
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:10,350
call it any names boom cogent but there

342
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,269
were some knocks that that weren't able

343
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,619
to understand the plus and the minus and

344
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:20,269
a diff so we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> translate to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> English</font>

345
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:20,269
add/remove there's a list of

346
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,889
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think they tried</font>

347
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:28,849
catching their their router files but

348
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:31,279
maybe they should so there's at the top

349
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,990
there's a list of changes it the default

350
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,319
format is English you can change it back

351
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,269
to diff mode you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it to full</font>

352
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:39,829
diff so that you can actually you know

353
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:42,110
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to apply the dips</font>

354
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,519
against your own files you can you can

355
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,170
change your vaca just a summary of plus

356
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,029
and minus or you can leave them in the

357
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">default of English and then there's a</font>

358
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:51,980
complete list so that everyone can can

359
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:53,748
skim through it see what's there make

360
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,889
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything is the way it</font>

361
00:15:53,749 --> 00:16:01,430
should be there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of the</font>

362
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:04,430
previous generation code you tell it the

format<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want and it generates a</font>

for using some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people may or may not</font>

want the<font color="#CCCCCC"> comp t in there it depends on</font>

367
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,059
whether your TF tp'ing the config or

you're you're you're doing it via a

370
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,589
you can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> juniper code</font>

you upload the<font color="#E5E5E5"> configs so here's an</font>

in you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the peering community who</font>

390

have been testing and giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a lot of</font>

00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:28,520
feedback on it but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably the</font>

392
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,230
first wide-scale use so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

393
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,520
breaks let me know if there's any

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,960
features that need to be added to let me

395
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360

things

397
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,570
Floyd pretty quickly there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

398
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:42,000
future plans for development on this

399
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,889
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it needs ipv6 support the</font>

400
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,270
reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't do ipv6 support</font>

401
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:51,809
for anyone that wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there are</font>

402
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:55,080
actually two query protocols for ir r 1

403
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:58,678
is based off our<font color="#E5E5E5"> adb and one is based</font>

404
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,139
off what ripe uses and the are adb tool

405
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,870
the version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is actually a faster</font>

406
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,000
protocol and that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can query</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> na s set</font>

407
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,030
and have the server break it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to a</font>

408
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,799
list of component autonomous systems

409
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:13,320
whereas the ripe version it only breaks

410
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,809
it down on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one level so for every if</font>

411
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,970
you've got a deeply nested is set you've

412
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:22,010
got a transaction latency back and forth

413
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:24,000
and if you've got this going over to

414
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,559
something far away like you know if

415
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,169
you're in the US and you're querying who

416
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:31,260
is that ripe and there's there's any

417
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:33,600
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of significant transaction latency</font>

418
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:38,070
what you tend to see is that the server

419
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,870
times out before you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

420
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,790
and I guess the bright servers have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

421
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,139
default hard time out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of three minutes</font>

422
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they close the socket and don't</font>

423
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,600
finish returning the answer so there

424
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:51,750
needs to be support written in this in

425
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to to handle that and that's just</font>

00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,210

431
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,390
to an SQL backend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may or may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

432
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:12,570
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do and this is</font>

433
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,290
assume that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have your</font>

434
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,970
own system for managing your own routers

435
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:19,799
so we didn't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was was</font>

436
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,330
sql-based right now because we didn't

437
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to to see how it would interact</font>

438
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,980
with other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's the existing systems</font>

439
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,720
but you know if you're a small company

440
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,760
and you know your list of one or two

441
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,350
routers that's fine if you're a larger

442
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">company and you've got 100 routers you</font>

443
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,928
probably have your own database with

444
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:38,760
your own configuration and information

445
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:41,429
so we tried to make this generic simple

446
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,150
not require anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> too complex other</font>

447
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,330
than

448
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:48,130
PHP the aggregate tool from Joe a Blee

452
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:03,669
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ir our web the goal there is</font>

453
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:05,590
to put up a web version of ir r so that

454
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:09,000
end users can register ralphs without

455
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:11,770
needing to know anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our psl</font>

456
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,530
we're hoping that that makes the process

457
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:16,690
so easy that everyone can do it that

458
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,908
every large network can just send their

459
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,770
customers there and say register<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an</font>

00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:22,780
account type in your list of prefixes

461
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,520
it's done it's easy to maintain you can

462
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,730
click and<font color="#E5E5E5"> delete and add and things like</font>

463
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,500
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's future development if you</font>

464
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,559
want to play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's up</font>

465
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,330
you can register routes see how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

466
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,730
if anything breaks let me know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

467
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:41,889
doesn't publish anywhere yet that's the

468
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,240
gist of it I'm sure there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

469
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,110
comments any time you say anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

489
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:59,450
comprehensive database so the way the

490
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,010
mirroring system works you don't get if

491
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,600
you mirror someone who mirrors five

492
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,950
other people you don't get the five

493
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,290
other people you only get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

494
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,330
person so everyone needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to configure a</font>

495
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,129
full mesh of everyone in order to get

496
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:13,189
this data when someone turns up a new

497
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:15,590
our database re DB is definitely the

498
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:18,890
most comprehensive version of that it

499
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,870
seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect with everyone the right</font>

500
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,240
version doesn't a lot of the other

501
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,620
people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have full mirrors so if</font>

you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running your queries the</font>

be great um oh my god it works freaking

505
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,640
me out uhhh i know that policy is one of

506
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,050
the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting things to start the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">morning off with and i know it's</font>

509
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,360
breathe Bors to think a lot about policy

510
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,190
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff is obviously important</font>

511
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,770
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions and then if</font>

512
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:52,900
other people have questions please come

513
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:55,760
up to the mic and and and ask them

Richard the the filters that it builds

515
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,990
are those prefix list only are they

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a request for a s path what</font>

it does right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is simply build based</font>

00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,139
off of

520
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:13,570
autonomous systems behind other

521
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,640
autonomous systems in a SS which may or

522
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,939
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the best way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go about</font>

523
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,330
doing it it actually in the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

524
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,409
does contain a list of a SS i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

525
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:27,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i would recommend using it as such</font>

526
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:29,559
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feedback on that to see how</font>

527
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:32,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">well it matches and how well it doesn't</font>

528
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,750
match I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in order to do</font>

529
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:37,630
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> properly you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to add import</font>

530
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,970
and export support which we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

531
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,250
right now but the majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

534
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:53,740
like v6 this meeting marks the 10th

535
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:56,350
anniversary of when I stood up<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font>

536
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,809
tried to push the routing registries and

537
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:05,260
that was Washington DC where Bob

538
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:08,100
Metcalfe ate his paper um the adoption

539
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:13,539
rate has not been great for this either

540
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:20,379
um I have not been successful selling it

541
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:22,330
very well what's wrong I think I looked

542
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,059
at a lot of what people seem to think

543
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,799
was wrong early on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what I'm</font>

544
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:29,710
taking a<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-phase approach to try to</font>

545
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,049
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of that by you know making</font>

546
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,779
it simple for everyone to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it</font>

547
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,279
simple for providers to use there's a

548
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:38,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of providers that don't have the</font>

549
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:40,120
time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go out and individually script</font>

550
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,178
this so that's where I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

551
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put this this tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out so that</font>

552
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,630
everyone will be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

553
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">know eventually when there's a high</font>

554
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,350
enough acceptance rate maybe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

555
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,190
become the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard way to operate in</font>

556
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:56,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the US as well certainly hope so so just</font>

557
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,510
a follow-up question<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Randy's question</font>

558
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,080
so so your take on this is as I

559
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,700
understand it that the the tools have

560
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,350
been too<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to use and that</font>

561
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a major barrier to adoption and</font>

562
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,500
also what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned was it's not</font>

563
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,870
integrated into the allocation process

564
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,279
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> this addresses the first of</font>

565
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,989
those right but doesn't really touch the

566
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:16,270
second at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right well there's</font>

567
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,610
there's multiple processes here the

568
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,559
first is the existing tools don't

569
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,120
address everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do</font>

570
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,180
to actually

571
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,559
deploy this in production the existing

572
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:29,130
tools are also difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use or</font>

573
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,899
difficult to compile and operate whether

574
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,970
they work or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they're probably</font>

575
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,559
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a replacement for those</font>

576
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:38,100
tools by the way because<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are the</font>

577
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,000
Swiss Army knife this is a chainsaw if

578
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,189
you want to actually cut through

579
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,780
something let's let's get it done but

580
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:48,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to screw anything in or</font>

581
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:51,450
open wine balls the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

582
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:54,300
ease of use for for the end user which

583
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,870
hopefully I are our web is intended to

584
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:00,600
address and the other problem is

585
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:04,080
integration with the rirs and a lot of

586
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:07,559
the benefit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the integration you see</font>

587
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,080
because you're closely related to who's

588
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:14,428
doing the allocations and who's managing

589
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,230
the the IRR stuff you can say we know

590
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,300
that this customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> has this block we're</font>

594
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,970
their space so they can start hijacking

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,130
routes or whatever the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be it</font>

596
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:32,010
needs to be verified by that person

597
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:35,780
whereas right now there's no connection

598
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:39,420
between the allocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> Authority and the</font>

601
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:48,270
fact if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use a s 1 2 3 colon</font>

602
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,990
people can actually register stuff in

603
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:54,120
your ASSE and make you start start

604
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,460
registering for routes that you don't

605

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Randy yeah oh I think in v6</font>

607
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,740
we're trying to tweak<font color="#CCCCCC"> the allocation</font>

608
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:11,070
policy when essentially we have a

609
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:14,280
something it's not selling and I think

610
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,990
we're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong end of this too I've</font>

611
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:20,370
been hacking tools to deal with this

612
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:22,920
stuff for a long while and I think the

613
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:27,209
basic problem is that there's no

614
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:29,190
critical mass so it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the</font>

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,440
problem no<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter how good the tools I</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply it the paint doesn't cover</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the surface</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's the the Internet routing industry</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it here i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that is being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done and I</font>

624
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:10,950

from those certificates actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok that</font>

631
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:38,679
then and the toolset that works with

632
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:41,370
that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you'll be cooking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:46,659

<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually write a system that does</font>

last comment that turns into a plug for

640
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,570
two things one is a talk that Randy's

641
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:03,040
giving later this morning that was added

642
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,530
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the schedule so please check the</font>

643
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,450
agenda because I suspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> given the title</font>

644
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,660
of the talk that I saw that he will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

645
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,890
commenting on that and the other is that

646
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,440
Richard will be talking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools</font>

647
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:16,720
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> this afternoon in some more detail</font>

648
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,250
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> irr tool set and we'd also</font>

649
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,590
like to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as an opportunity to</font>

650
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,870
have more discussion about IRR so we'll

651
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:25,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the last two comments over here and</font>

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:28,059
then move on please<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew the whole</font>

attention to a policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's currently</font>

655
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:35,139
being proposed in the Aaron region to

656
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:38,820
modify the org template to include a

657
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:41,080
field that's optional to put your asn in

658
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,260
so there are people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this</font>

659
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,560
would create an authoritative register

would link autonomous systems and

661
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,070
organizations and the routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:56,110
in the future that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

also pull from to extract data to build

future good ideally the best way to

693
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:27,550
I am curious about the there is a

definition of a security model for the

RP SL language its many many years old

696
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:39,040
would the tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are suggesting</font>

697
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:41,020
have any way of verifying the

00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,040
authorization that's defined in that

699
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,810
sort of thing I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of any of</font>

700
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,629
those specifications that I couldn't

703
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,000
from what I'm told implements that it's

704
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,320
things like if you're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a route</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">authorization of the prefix holder and</font>

707
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,649
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS number right so you know it's</font>

708
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,139
that all right that seems to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

709
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:10,250
that the right panel is it but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

710
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:12,980
said this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is presented in a noggin and</font>

711
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:15,350
the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was coming at it was what</font>

712
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:18,860
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to get us operators on the</font>

713
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,360
same level as everyone else so where

714
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,149
we're at right now supporting the

715
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,280
features that are available on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US I</font>

716
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:28,610
are our servers and if we can get those

717
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:31,190
features deployed then I'd love to be

718
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:34,760
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support them you were you've</font>

719
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:36,470
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reference to the separation</font>

720
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,970
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the allocation registries and</font>

721
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:42,050
that and the route registries and

722
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:43,760
there's this need for tying the

723
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,860
authorization for the prefix to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

724
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,540
authorization to<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaks and the a s</font>

725
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,340
number to the authorization put things

726
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,980
in the round registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that right</font>

727
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,899
sounds like a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

728
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,940
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> done right yeah part of the other</font>

729
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:59,150
problem with the irr is there's a lot of

730
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:01,160
legacy data out there anyone that has

731
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:03,140
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the net for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years will</font>

732
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,930
see some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their prefixes from 10 years</font>

733
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:09,680
ago still registered sometimes not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

734
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:13,040
by them so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely something</font>

735
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:15,700
that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be addressed excellent</font>

736
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,700
thank you
