from where'd we meet last Universal City

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,839
I did a talk on routing security and I'm

not talking about how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure your</font>

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:32,700
routing security where you have signed

routes signed prefixes and signed a SS

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,200
that are formally done is what's missing

32
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,070
is how the certificates in the keys move

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:46,439
around how we distribute that that the

34
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:48,809
equivalent of we've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRR and you</font>

35
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,630
can query it and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth how</font>

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,439
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a public key infrastructure</font>

37
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:57,990
that has the database in it that holds

38
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,600
the certificates of the rirs so their

39
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,500
identity is known that holds the

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,229
certificates of the ISPs so our

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:10,020
identities are known in sight similarly

42
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,270
and then the attestations that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR</font>

43
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,100
sign that says this has been given to

that is p

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:21,019
in other words binding the address to

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and similarly for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asn how do</font>

47
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:27,560
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this okay and let's be clear about</font>

48
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,790
what we mean by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attestations it</font>

59
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,730

but iono does give chunks of a essence

62
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,860
to the registries and the registries

63
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:16,700
actually some registries have given

chunks to isps who need multiples Orton

point is both our hierarchy and we can

see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's used the iono allocates to</font>

00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,490
the contractual thing and that's it they

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,080
are identity certs they don't need in

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,020
difference where I get that cert and big

130
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,570
organizations will want to manage their

own small organizations who cares you

132
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:37,719
get it from your IR IR so the rirs

133
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,130

134
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,000
public keys are part of the cert they

135
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,400
can get them from

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,140
above like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

outside the hard issues and the one this

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,930
there's the database and we'll go into

there's the beneficial but the people

brain gas but are there any time to live

234
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,250
when they certificate yes the

235
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:10,029
certificates do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> X PRIZE like normal</font>

236
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:12,430
and so but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the key thing</font>

237
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:15,970
of separating out how we do the ISP

238
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:19,779
search is when i<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an address space</font>

239
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,790
from Erin in reality and the truth when

240
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you read your contract you will see that</font>

241
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:27,910
that address i have as long as i keep

242
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,890
paying on so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to accept</font>

243
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:33,279
and we have accepted for a decade now

244
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,949
that to keep that address space i have

245
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,100
to keep paying my tithe and so they'll

246
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:42,719
tie the expiration to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> length of the</font>

247
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,040

248
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,380
administrative etc they'll give me an

but but they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear their people</font>

290
00:14:52,330 --> 00:15:01,550
DHS the rirs etc etc need to hear from

291
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,380
this community that gosh if you'll

292
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:07,219
actually do it for us and give us the

293
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:11,990
tools we would prefer this to get one

294
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,550
more hack on the AR AR AR I<font color="#CCCCCC"> irr etc so</font>

295
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,410
the second question that's why I'm up

296
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,689
here I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in my market this is my</font>

298
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:23,980
that's why I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> my marketing closed</font>

299
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:26,600
today because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we want a rigorous</font>

300
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,880
verifiable solution second what's the

301
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,270
forum to discuss and nail down all the

302
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,270
details

303
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:38,640

305
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">this region right here is not bad so</font>

306
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,020
we're gonna have a whole bunch Montreal

307
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,199
our working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Montreal Aaron</font>

308
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,060
meeting would be a great place if it is

309
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,160
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right forum there's officers</font>

310
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,430
right well what's a router similar I

311
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:07,469
mean what's the definition of a right

312
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:10,829
for pardon hi Anna isn't a forum um let

313
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,630
me cut through that I'm not one that

314
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:16,560
believes in design by committee unless

315
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:18,210
you want a camel um so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

316
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,800
the right people either it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as</font>

317
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,690
enough and if we want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen and</font>

318
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,680
it's right well that's the place to make

319
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,920
it happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we need is to communicate</font>

320
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:33,329
that we as a community want this

321
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:37,620
approach and I'm sure that competent

322
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:40,890
security folk such as Sandy's family and

323
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:46,890
friends Steve Kent's the Bell oven etc

324
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:51,449
etc will gladly take on the task but but

325
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:55,080
what's missing is for us as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> for we as</font>

326
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:57,900
a community possible for we to send the

327
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,180
message for us to send the message for

328
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:05,280
us as a community to send the message

329
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:08,760
that we want a correct rigorous and

330
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,939
verifiable solution and the reason we've

331
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,670
been waffling is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see a path to</font>

332
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:18,800
one and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say there are</font>

333
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,800
valid paths there we go go for advanced

334
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,390
pardon

335
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:27,760
the short comment soliciting input from

336
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,260
this group is a great thing but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

337
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,629
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be more targeted in your</font>

338
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,010
marketing effort you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at why</font>

339
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,540
previous efforts along these lines

340
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,240
failed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to go to those</font>

341
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,530
organizations and ask them<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they'll</font>

342
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,130
support this when they didn't support

343
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:45,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous efforts Ted so basically right</font>

344
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,260
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> the skitter core group to use some</font>

345
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:50,350
sure I understand take you around here

346
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,700
Chris morrow if you get them on you have

347
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:55,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on board or this is always</font>

348
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:58,060
I'm trying I'm trying come on Chris hi

349
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:04,810
Chris there's microphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris i'll</font>

350
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:06,700
leave in line no I don't want them to

351
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:10,679
filter their customers I want them to

352
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">say they will attest to their customers</font>

353
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:17,530
so that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need to build filters we</font>

354
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,050
do filter customers they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to</font>

355
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">email us to say what they want at it but</font>

356
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,190
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this highlights</font>

357
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:26,230
is not filtering or not it's being able

358
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,820
to verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the filter is correct or</font>

359
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,010
not so if a customer sends me a thousand

360
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,470
routes the guy who's going to do the

361
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,270
prefixes update honestly probably not

362
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,800
going to do the checking he should but

363
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,420
if I had something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shove it into a</font>

364
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,639
system it automatically pop out and say

365
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,380
999 of a thousand are correct this one's

366
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,470
wrong go tell the customer to fix it in

367
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,180
some way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be better some type</font>

368
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,740
of automation and that if you want to

369
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,330
use certificates if you want to use some

370
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,160
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of way to make a automation</font>

371
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,919
happen great I don't really care

372
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,380
actually so doctors anymore with this

373
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,230
scheme what's that there are no filters

374
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,760
with this scheme no you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

375
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,980
implying folders you're just saying that

<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I have a big / 12 and I</font>

380
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:15,520
the announcement and check the signature

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would go as far as making</font>

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,930
a routing protocol do that but

383
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:28,280
actually this is neutral to<font color="#E5E5E5"> SP GP and</font>

384
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:31,799
sob GP i prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> SP GP sob GP would</font>

separate paths verification but let's

387
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:41,340
not go into that particular war<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I need to keep this short so if we can</font>

390
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,270
statement is basically I'm not sure I

391
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,520
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is the routing protocol today</font>

392
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:54,600
but being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and the OSS</font>

393

394
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,850
can figure the routing problem odd I'm

<font color="#E5E5E5">just a chemical engineer thank you I</font>

but as somebody who provides transit for

435
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:04,240
and it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for building</font>

436
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:06,860
filterless and it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used for</font>

437
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,990

439
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:14,840
or even so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as having signatures in</font>

440
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol that this is a first step</font>

441
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,899
for a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

446
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:31,879
to actually build they want to do a list

of blood if you want to do it with

448
