00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
hi I'm Peter booth this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is James hebert</font>

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,440
and we're here to talk about short-lived

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,599
prefix hijacking on the internet and how

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,920
prevalent is it and how we tried to

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,330
detect it and what we found so<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,529
when you give a talky guy give an

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,278
outline so people know what you're going

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell him first we tell you what the</font>

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem is we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find then we</font>

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,890
tell you how we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find it then</font>

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,229
tell you what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> found and then we'll</font>

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,820
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about future work and what what can</font>

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,520
be done to make it better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and provide</font>

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,829
you guys with better data so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,780
prefix hijacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's announcing space</font>

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,540
that belongs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to someone else without</font>

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">their permission so there's lots of</font>

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,019
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> for doing this but almost all of</font>

19
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,218
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> are bad so we want to detect it and</font>

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,199
presumably you guys don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen to you there's different time</font>

22
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,070
scales scales four hijackings and you

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,960
know these different time scales are

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,030
used for different purposes short-lived

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,969
hijackings are great if you want to get

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,680
IP space for spamming or launching it

27
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,290
launching really quick attacks and then

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,630
just going away if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to share</font>

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">your legal material anonymously or I</font>

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,970
don't know run some sort of illicit ISP

31
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,830
then you might want longer-lived space

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,840
but we're searching for short-lived

33
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,070
hijackings in part because it's the

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:27,060
low-hanging fruit because well you'll

35
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:31,470
see in a bit because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at this</font>

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:35,700
this is the love life<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uptime</font>

37
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,770
percentages for<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS prefix payers so if</font>

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,110
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this graph which is kind of</font>

39
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,689
hard to see but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see the red line</font>

40
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,340
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that almost everything is up</font>

41
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:50,490
for more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than ninety five percent of the</font>

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:52,140
time and then the remainder is and so

43
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">those were those are probably legit I</font>

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,600
mean they show up they don't go away in

45
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,908
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very real sense if they take it and no</font>

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,699
one takes it back session is a huge

47
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,479
chunk of what we give credit for here

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,479
and

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,470
then when an AS legitimately controls a

50
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,940
net block any short-lived announcement

51
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,830
by a different day s inside that block

52
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,750
is presumed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be either a msconfig or</font>

53
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,370
an invasion really the kind of all

54
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,430
invasions but some of them are

55
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,880
attributable to fat fingering or

56
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:27,540
stupidity instead of malice and because

57
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,579
we have to prime our sample rib if you

58
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">announce at the very beginning of our</font>

59
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:37,410
sample period we just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you're</font>

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:40,619
legit so we might miss up to 130th of

61
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,859
the pre of the hijackings because that's

62
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,890
the time spring we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and</font>

63
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,650
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our graph most of them</font>

64
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,480

65
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,780
not up for a long time they're hardly up

66
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,190
at all and the ones in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle are</font>

67
00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:01,650
interesting and often connection by

68
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:03,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">Boeing so route views input data we</font>

69
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,280
searched all the update messages and

refuge in the rat views data for the

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,790
some anonymized data that all it all

74
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,930
looked like this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't really from</font>

75
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,579
2007 though and you know when we make a

tree<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd read that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP address</font>

inserted into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like you</font>

79
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,040
might think a router does if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were</font>

80
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,410
modeling it as a theory person and a

list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> SN's are which announced the</font>

83
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,410
and whenever you insert a new prefix you

84
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,920
say is this invading anything and if it

85
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start recording and we start</font>

86
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,059
talking it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember we said</font>

up for a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and we want to kind</font>

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,959
of eliminate those the our threshold was

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">90% for reasons that you saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font>

91
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,680
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so percentage up time is the</font>

92
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,079
time between the first announcement and

93
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,090
that announcements withdrawal and then

94
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,880
the time between the and the sum of all

95
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,560
those times it was in the rib divided by

96
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,760
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the very first</font>

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,459
announcement because maybe it's a new

98
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,620
prefix just coming online so for this

99
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,920
particular one line is high when it's in

100
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,770
the river

101
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,560
up times around ten percent so if that

102
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">was inside someone else's space we would</font>

buying IP space from everybody else ah

eliminated as possible invasion but not

121
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,850
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be careful here because</font>

mutually exclusive up times we have to

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,080
make sure we're not eliminating ones

124
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:24,090
where a competing announcement boots it

125
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,870
from the rib so when it in order for it

to be eliminated<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non overlapping time</font>

explicit withdrawal before we get the

129

146
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,340
like it if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the same mass but</font>

147
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,100
instead the same core

<font color="#E5E5E5">brit entity or person or personal entity</font>

149
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,560
ah then like 18 th TT of global wireless

150
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:44,630
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll also say oh not an invasion</font>

151
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,520
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not and then we get into</font>

152
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,100
some sort of more<font color="#E5E5E5"> touchy feely ones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

153
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,599
if you're in riv be and you have a

customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> provider relationship with this</font>

155
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,710

we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a customer</font>

invaded their explicit provider as<font color="#CCCCCC"> note</font>

159
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,919
from our ad be so if the invader and

160
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">invading have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship the</font>

162
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:18,320
legitimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we look at the</font>

163
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:20,930
announcement data the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual path that</font>

164
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,450
the announcement took and the path that

165
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:26,210
got stored in the rib and if the person

166
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,789
being invaded the invade<font color="#CCCCCC"> II passed along</font>

167
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,010
their invasion prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is there on</font>

168
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:33,560
the path they helped pass it along and

169
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:37,520
said oh sure you can route a hijack from

170
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,729
me through me then that's probably okay

171
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,830
because they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're helping their</font>

172
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,650
attackers so that we were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we're</font>

173
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,960
also going to call that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good and</font>

174
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:51,679
finally a fat fingering turns out to be

175
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,388
far more prevalent than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I expected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

176
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,849
with changing switch we were sort of

177
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:59,090
blown away<font color="#E5E5E5"> by this and so if the prefix</font>

178
00:07:55,849 --> 00:08:03,400
in question is like one one keystroke

179
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:06,859
away from something else that the

180
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,859
announcing a s owns and withdraws it

181
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,440
really fast we generally gave them a

182
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,580
pass and said oh that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

183
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,139
just miss type of some things that's

184
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:20,740
kind of a hijacked in that prefix was on

185
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:24,410
announced in an unauthorized manner but

186
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,139
it certainly wasn't malicious so here's

187
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,389
a suspect case it's a short<font color="#CCCCCC"> live / 24</font>

00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,800
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used within an unrelated to a s a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this we have they asked the net lock up</font>

192

when the line is high that a s net block

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 / 24 s involved in a probable</font>

hijacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 so let's run through our</font>

199
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:04,430
tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick first of all let's</font>

200
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,839
just look at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and go oh weird</font>

201
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:11,709
twenty-fours appearing for a week plus

202
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:16,879
right around a<font color="#E5E5E5"> week and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going away</font>

203
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:22,189
that's kind of weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay 26 to 28 are</font>

204
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:27,110
they the same people<font color="#E5E5E5"> as 6-4 6-1 no do</font>

205
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:29,180
they own it in who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no 26 to 28 yeah</font>

206
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,540
do 28 is not the owner of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that net blog</font>

207
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:37,069
6-4 6-1 doesn't have a relationship with

208
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:40,639
26 to 28 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a DB 6-4 6-1 was not</font>

209
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:43,128
seen propagating those announcements and

210
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,949
the hijack prefixes are not

211
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:48,949
lexicographically similar to 26 to 28

212
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:51,620
other more legitimate looking other

213
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:53,779
legitimate looking prefixes so we're

214
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,089
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of willing to go it looks like a</font>

215
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:59,389
hijacking probable though because it

216
00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:00,589
can't be entirely sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also have</font>

217
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:02,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be very careful because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're relying</font>

218
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,600
on who is data for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this analysis and</font>

219
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:08,240
we were fooled we've run the study twice

220
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,600
once<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last June and once in December</font>

221
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,559
and we were actually fooled by a lag in

222
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,129
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is data in June we saw the following</font>

223
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:23,389
this 20 / 20 for being announced inside

224
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:27,319
I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> units / 12 and at the</font>

225
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:28,879
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the announcement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh that block</font>

226
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:33,378
was not registered as having been sub

227
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:36,139
allocated<font color="#CCCCCC"> the a s 17 284 was also not</font>

228
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:40,220
registered as hat in who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was</font>

229
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:43,779
like what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh and 17 284</font>

230
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:47,089
announced nothing else in June but now

231
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:49,459
who is data indicates that 17<font color="#E5E5E5"> 284 and</font>

232
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:52,579
the owner of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that prefix are the same</font>

233
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:54,859
entity so we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to note here that</font>

234
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:57,969
detection<font color="#E5E5E5"> methods based on who is data</font>

235
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:02,920
will inevitably generate false positives

236
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,920
until the<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is data catches up so</font>

237
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:09,790
that's just an unavoidable thing for any

238
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:13,699
method that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> dependent on who is data</font>

239
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,230
we kind of hoped that if we post a list

240
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:17,540
of lists of things that look like

241
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,209
hijacking and they're not based on

242
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,738
because who is data is lagging people

243
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:24,529
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more likely to update their who</font>

244
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:26,149
is data but we'll see so let's talk

245
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:28,790
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of hijackings that we</font>

246
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:31,399
saw in december two thousand five there

247
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,319
was a population of 845<font color="#E5E5E5"> a esas which</font>

248
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:37,489
simultaneously announced a prefix inside

249

in other a SS and those prefixes that

250
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:44,779
they announced inside had a low up time

251
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:47,660
we randomly sampled<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5% of this group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 442</font>

255
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:57,259
those 42 were not easily explained as

00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:59,959
misconfigurations this is compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

257

nine that we found in<font color="#CCCCCC"> June given our</font>

258
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,290
entire population we then have a

00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:06,519
ninety-five percent confidence interval

260
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,959
for our sample which means that would

261
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,899
ninety-five percent confident that

262
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">between 26 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-five successful</font>

prefix hijackings occurred in december

00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:20,868
two thousand five that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah 96 and just</font>

265
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,059
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear here that's</font>

266
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:25,429
not the actually counting the prefixes

267
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:27,049
that's counting between 26 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 95</font>

268
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:31,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">guesses were involved in prefix</font>

269
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:35,809
hijacking that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found in this thing so</font>

270
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:40,519
that's what we've found and that's was

271
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:43,519
kind of surprising in<font color="#E5E5E5"> June we found a 9</font>

272
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,589
in when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we investigated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">investigated ten percent in June we</font>

274
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:54,079
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine so there were uh we found</font>

275
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:56,539
more but we there our initial population

276
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,189
was smaller because there were fewer

277
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:59,869
that had announced a prefix inside

278
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:03,618
another a SS and had a low percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

279
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:06,739
time so it turns out that there's a been

280
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:09,139
a slight decrease since June but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

281
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:09,320
these error bars are kind of large so we

282
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:13,220
can

283
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:17,480
be entirely<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure so for us or others to</font>

284
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:19,100
do we'd really like to refine our search

285
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,230
criteria because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

286
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,660
intuition involved a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

287
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:27,460
research consisted of going this block

288
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:31,400
appeared here and this block went here

289
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:34,280
Randy what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hell's going on and Randy</font>

290
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,329
would say something like well of course

291
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,860
they're just splitting up their net

292
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,220
block between providers and it's you

293
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,990
know and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like oh okay so there's</font>

294
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:45,440
a lot of sort of operator intuition

295
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:48,230
where we tried to codify that but we

296
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,490
could still use more and automation of

297
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,740
the remaining manual steps would be

298
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,180
really nice the<font color="#CCCCCC"> radd is the obvious one</font>

299
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,060
for the that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easiest one to</font>

300
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,459
automate but all the others would be

301
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,339
great too we'd also really like to

302
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,020
decrease our reliance on who is or make

303
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,790
who is more accurate I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

304
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,390
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people would like that though and yet</font>

305
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:10,579
somehow it still hasn't happened and

306
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,770
we'd really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to figure out and</font>

307
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,740
because this was the low-hanging fruit

308
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,689
we should just<font color="#CCCCCC"> note that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

309
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,400
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to deal with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as post</font>

310
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,830
pending being potentially used to

311
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,250
disguise attacks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know right a</font>

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:29,360
little custom modify zebra or something

00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,660

316
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,819
length by one but<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a sudden our</font>

317
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,040
method will totally not detect it at all

318
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,050
and what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term typed</font>

319
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,699
hijackings how could we detect those

320
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,349
could we use this method at all what

321
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:50,230
what would we do so that's sort of a

322
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:54,770
things to keep in mind for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future so</font>

323
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:57,680
let's sum up we can identify between 26

324
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,030
and 95 hijacking instances in route

325
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,270
these data for december two thousand

326
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:07,069
five this is out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a population of 842</font>

327
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:09,560
845 so there are many many more miss

328
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:13,010
configs and false alarms than purposeful

329
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,750
hijackings and if those links if you're

330
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,160
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the PDF which everybody's got</font>

331
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,690
their sort of head down at their laptop

332
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,699
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> click on that link you</font>

333
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:25,190
don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> type it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can say</font>

334
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,440
so you can see you're a s and whatever

335
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll get there in a bit so detection up</font>

336
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,420
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last step is automated but</font>

337
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,180
further automation remains dependent on

338
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,420
good who is data which as we know is a

339
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,550
hard problem we can make our code

340
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,900
available in a number of ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'd</font>

341
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,370
like to make our results and any future

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,560
automated results available to meet the

343
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,900
community's needs via maybe a<font color="#CCCCCC"> biweekly</font>

email you know do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more stuff</font>

ways click those links tell me all about

negative tell me into the mic or you

we'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear about it so that we</font>

365
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,140
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run our detection methods</font>

366
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,370
on it and see if it is detected<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see</font>

367
00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:00,410
if it would would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been a helpful</font>

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,349
any comments questions

371
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:17,629
just curious if your detection picked up

372
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:21,949
the panics<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah didn't check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh what's a</font>

373
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:25,040
it should who miss<font color="#CCCCCC"> announced panics and</font>

374
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:28,100
stuff I like you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> check it out on</font>

375
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:31,690
the page it's right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it happened to</font>

376
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:34,129
be one of our customers unfortunately

377
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:38,300
were they in are a DB is one of your

378
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:41,390
customers there was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> old route object</font>

379
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,879
left in there so when the customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

380
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:48,020
customer eventually left it caused the

381
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,540
prefix to be accepted right so the what

382
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:56,000
we actually checked in our a DB was if

383
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:58,970
there was a accept any from or there

384
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't an acceptable rocks or the</font>

385
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:06,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">import/export field yeah that's long</font>

386
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:10,570
eject so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll think about objects all</font>

387
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,570
right anybody else
