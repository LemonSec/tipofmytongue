I good<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning everybody today I'm going</font>

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:13,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">to give a little talk about DNS cache</font>

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:17,520
poisoners the motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this began</font>

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:21,210
almost a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when the sans internet</font>

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,580
storm center reported that there was an

ongoing<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS cache poisoning attack and</font>

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,339
was a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs there for your</font>

background on those the basics of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,860
attack were that some name servers had

been<font color="#CCCCCC"> poisoned and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were giving out</font>

00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:47,399
the folks at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sands is C had theories</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been as a way to propagate spyware</font>

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,408
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time they noted that most of the</font>

19
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,520
including nte 2000 2003 and this

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,860

oh right these are these are now

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:34,000
available on the web<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here's</font>

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,789
here's a one slide it just sort of

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,850
describes the DNS cache poisoning attack

27
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:42,610
an authoritative name server that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,500
where queries would normally go for for

29
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,930
certain names is intentionally or

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,110
unintentionally configured to return

31
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,810
bogus and out of bailiwick NS Authority

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,350
records and the four following slides

33
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:59,650
have an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks a</font>

34
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,229
caching name server sends a query to

35
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:06,220
that authoritative name server and gets

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,850
a response and trusts the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bogus</font>

37
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,650
referral and it stores it in the cache

38
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:14,350
future queries for names in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> poison</font>

39
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,440
zone then go to the bogus name server

40
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:20,230
and that bogus name server returns

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,690
incorrect answers to queries that it

42
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:29,970
should never even be receiving so here's

43
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:32,290
a here's an example with dig you can

44
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,720
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> run this command yourself and</font>

45
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,929
and you might see the same thing I ran

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,270
dig with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace option for long</font>

47
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,930
island auction com and the first

48
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,610
response that it shows is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the set of</font>

49
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:50,709
name servers that are authoritative for

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:53,140
the DNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> root then it sends a query to</font>

51
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:56,640
one of those in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case we got a</font>

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">response from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> M root and M root says</font>

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:27,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">response from off one NS Sargasso net</font>

59
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:30,250
and we have an an a record in the answer

60
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:34,090
but we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have three NS records that</font>

61
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,450
show they list themselves they list the

62
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,849
Sargasso net

63
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:42,018
nameservers as authoritative for the

64
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:45,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">coms own so if this response was</font>

65
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:48,379
received by a vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS cache it</font>

66
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:51,140
would then send<font color="#E5E5E5"> future requests for</font>

67
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:53,870
unknown names in<font color="#CCCCCC"> comm to one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

68
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,018
nameservers and you can simulate that

69
00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:02,269
yourself by again using dig you can send

70
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:03,739
a query say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4w wal com to one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

71
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,400
nameservers and you get an answer like

72
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:10,310
this you get an a record back with 127

73
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,150
127 127 which is not particularly useful

74
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,459
and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the authority</font>

75
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:24,320
Authority section says you know i am

76
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:26,360
still authoritative 4.com so a little

77
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit about the implementations that are</font>

78
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,810
known to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be vulnerable windows NT is</font>

79
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,740

80
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,419
you have service<font color="#CCCCCC"> pack for you can make</font>

81
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,990
it become not infernal neural with a

<font color="#E5E5E5">little registry editing pain if one is</font>

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">2000 the early versions were vulnerable</font>

84
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:50,750
by default and later versions were not

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,030
windows 2003 is not vulnerable by

86
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,060
default but it's remarkably easy to make

87
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,859
it vulnerable you just have to go to the

88
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,380
properties section of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS server and</font>

89
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,940
uncheck the box that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says protect me</font>

90
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,840
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS cache poisoning Symantec</font>

91
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,520
Gateway firewall products were

92
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,169
vulnerable and there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

93
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,400
keywords<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you can google for if</font>

94
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:17,479
you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in following up on</font>

95
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:19,070
that so one of the things that that I

96
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally wanted to do was I wanted to</font>

97
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:27,349
find out how big<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this problem and how</font>

98
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:29,720
many DNS poisoners are out there so

99
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:33,380
here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technique that that I</font>

100
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:37,090
used first and one of the hardest things

101
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,260
is to just get a huge list of DNS names

102
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,000
and go through them<font color="#E5E5E5"> one by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one and for</font>

103
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,570
each name discover the set of

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,380
authoritative servers for the zone and

105
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,030
to do that my little script

106
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,630
sends its own query starting at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root</font>

107
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,099
and follows the referrals on down once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

108
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,110
get the the set of all the authoritative

109
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,740
name servers send a query to each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

110
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:02,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">those and in those replies I compare the</font>

111
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,770
NS RR set to the previously learned

112
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:08,500
referrals from the parent zones and if

113
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,320
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't match then that's the case of</font>

114
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:16,060
DNS cache poisoning this technique<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

115
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:18,969
finds cases where where a parent zone is

116
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,730
cached and at this point we're sort of

117
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,400
only interested in cases where a TLD

118
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:30,340
becomes poisoned because those are sort

119
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:32,950
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big targets so there's a survey I</font>

120
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,810
have a survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I started earlier</font>

121
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,960
this month and it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

122
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">running the input list is a little more</font>

123
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,120
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 million names captured from</font>

124
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:47,110
various name servers that that we have

125
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:51,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">access to and in those so far we've</font>

126
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:54,190
found 284 sources of poison these are

127
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:57,840
the ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> return incorrect referrals</font>

128
00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:02,550
to top-level domain or to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root zone</font>

129
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,960
this little<font color="#E5E5E5"> table shows which zones are</font>

130
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,510
being poisoned or attempting to be

131
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,320
poisoned most common one is the root

132
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:15,070
zone itself with 217 and then you know

133
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">not surprisingly c-calm net org and so</font>

134
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,599
on there's actually one case where

135
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:22,690
someone is returning a bad referral to a

136
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,180
TLD called default which for most people

137
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,300
does not exist although<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sort of an</font>

138
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:31,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting way to perhaps capture</font>

139
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,830
traffic for a TLD that that people may

140
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,290
be using but that's not officially

141
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,359
sanctioned if you added these numbers up

142
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:41,490
you'd get more than 284 because some

143
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,490
name servers poison more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> one zone</font>

144
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:48,880
here's a list of a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the poisoners</font>

145
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,250
that we found and when you read through

146
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">those lists something becomes sort of</font>

147
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,830
immediately apparent that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

148
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,500

by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way at the end of this talk I'll</font>

give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a URL where you can go to our</font>

list of poisoners yourself and explore

160
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:40,390
it and find more interesting things so

161
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:43,390
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I already mentioned a lot of these</font>

162
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,560
poisoning name servers appeared to be

163
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,620
companies that are an idiot dns business

164
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:52,459
registrar's and resellers and perhaps

165
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,290
speculators and typo profiteers others

166
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:56,779
appear to be companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

167
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,969
unrelated<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS business certainly</font>

168
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,050
those that that are the business of

169
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,320
handling domain age they should know

170
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,120
better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and you would hope that</font>

171
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,890
that they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to configure</font>

172
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,380
their own name servers correctly and

173
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,600
properly so that this kind of thing

174
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,120
doesn't happen another thing that

175
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,329
becomes obvious is a lot of the names

176
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,089
that lead to the poisoning authoritative

177
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:23,149
name servers are names that have been

178
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:26,300
expired or have been parked recently

179
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:32,420
registered but not yet placed exactly in

180
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:36,010
service and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

181
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:38,800
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the slide but for the 284</font>

182
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:44,569
poisoning name servers that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

183
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,770
there's about 20,000 DNS names which for

184
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:51,020
which those nameservers are

185
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:53,029
authoritative so all this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of begs</font>

186
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,270
the question is is the sky falling is

187
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:58,189
this a big disaster<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you know so</font>

188
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,699
many poisoners out there why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

189
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear more about this well one really</font>

190
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,230
good thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the vulnerable</font>

191
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,470
implementations do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow the root</font>

192
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,690
zone to be poisoned so that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cuts</font>

193
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,420
out a big percentage of the poisoners

194
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,480
that we see out there

195
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:19,279
but for the others it's it's clear that

196
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,290
the name server can be named server

197
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,209
cache can become poisoned and that they

198
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:27,740
are so then it makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder if your</font>

199
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:31,550
name server was poisoned how would you

200
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">know in the most obvious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way I can think</font>

201
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might know is that if you're</font>

202
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,959
browsing the web and you go to some site

203
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:40,670
and you get back bad information what

204
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,729
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> your what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

205
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:46,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">web browser so we simulated that for</font>

206
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,610
every bad referral that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found we put</font>

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bogus name servers address in</font>

208
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:56,029
resolv.conf we open up a web<font color="#CCCCCC"> browser and</font>

209
00:10:52,670 --> 00:11:00,170
request google com and microsoft com and

210
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,910
then we took a screenshot so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

211
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:08,149
examples of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the screenshots that</font>

212
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:13,490
we got note that in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> location bar the</font>

213
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:17,360
URL there says<font color="#CCCCCC"> WWE google com and on the</font>

214
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,820
HTML page itself it says WWE google com

215
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:25,459
this page is parked free courtesy of

216
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:28,339
godaddy.com so one thing that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes</font>

217
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:30,290
me think is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this name server which</font>

218
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:33,320
is listed<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the top there probably has</font>

219
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:36,860
a wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> card and answers any query that</font>

220
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,000
you sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and then you know the CGI</font>

221
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,970
script or whatever is configured to

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,339
insert the name that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was quite for in</font>

223
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:48,860
the HTML there here's a sort of a

224
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:51,740
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> example again it says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google in</font>

225
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,019
the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> location bar we recently</font>

226
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">registered our domain name at name scale</font>

227
00:11:54,019 --> 00:12:00,079
com what's also interesting about this

228
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:02,510
one is that they're displaying some

229
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,439
google adwords here and it also appears

230
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,269
that the contents<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those google</font>

231
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">adwords are related to google itself so</font>

232
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,279
they they've asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> google for Edwards</font>

233
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,930
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google and they got all these</font>

234
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,730
links about search ins and some search

235
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,729
engine engine submission and so on

236
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,810
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another example very similar not</font>

237
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,410
really too remarkable except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

238
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,849
fact that and this one the location URL

239
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:33,819
has changed so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably been an</font>

240
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:35,320
HTTP redirect involved here here's a

241
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,130
case where the name server did not

242
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,860
provide an answer for our query to w

243
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,930
google com this is actually quite common

244
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,390
a lot of the screenshots look like this

245
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,040
it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> says unknown host so in this</font>

246
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,180
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely know well you</font>

247
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,520
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be able to figure out</font>

248
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:57,130
that something's wrong with with

249
00:12:51,520 --> 00:13:02,819
somebody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS somewhere here's a case</font>

250
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,820
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can buy various types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of pills</font>

251
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:11,910
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example again this is google at</font>

252
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,910
the top it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has nothing to do with google</font>

253
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:16,209
this this one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is interesting for</font>

254
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,600
a number of reasons first of all there's

255
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:22,209
this annoying shockwave download pop up

256
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,810
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle also note that the</font>

257
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:32,229
location bar URL has changed a little it

258
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:33,400
says google com / start PHP notice also

259
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,010
that on the right side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen</font>

260
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,630
there's some images<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

261
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,569
be some images those didn't come through

262
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:44,140
the server you know returned an error

263
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,880
for those requests but<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps most</font>

264
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,310
interestingly the the content of this

265
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,660
text down here talks about how Vint Cerf

266
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,300
is coming to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak at the domain</font>

267
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">roundtable and the guy who runs the site</font>

268
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,680
is very excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he wants to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet</font>

269
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,319
conserve and he's the executive director

270
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,810
executive event director of this domain

271
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,740
roundtable event so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a guy that</font>

272
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely think should know</font>

273
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:11,290
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you know know how to</font>

274
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:13,779
configure his name server here's one

275
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:19,439
where you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and configure your your</font>

276
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:19,439
power site system for google com

277
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:29,930
this one says smart people choose pair

278
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:34,580
neck and I sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of beg to differ I like</font>

279
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,989
this one because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if if you're</font>

280
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the type of person that uses Google</font>

281
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,720
every day you might look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and you</font>

282
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,580
might think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually is google</font>

283
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,180
it looks sort of like what you'd expect

284
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,160
it's a find it bar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a search button</font>

285
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,750
and some other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the little tag</font>

286
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,550
line there says we<font color="#CCCCCC"> search so you don't</font>

287
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:54,160
have to you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could very well be</font>

288
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,160
Google's model for all my mother knows

290
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:06,530
one because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> says I don't know if you</font>

302
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:32,300
actually happening here is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys</font>

running this site and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this name server</font>

304
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:38,030
are poisoning other people's DNS caches

305
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,970
and that poison is causing them to come

306
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,500
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this site so they're aware that</font>

307
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,440
something is wrong here but they haven't

308
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,660
quite figured it out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually sent</font>

309
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:55,640
email to these guys a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago but I</font>

310
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:57,380
didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so sort</font>

311
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,600
of the last thing that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

312
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">about is you know why is this happening</font>

313
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,700
or is this people being lazy being

314
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:08,090
stupid or are these people being truly

315
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,870
evil so I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

316
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:18,080
categories for you here's an example of

317
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:20,960
what i would call laziness the name

318
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:28,400
server here is in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> example is NS 1</font>

319
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:31,220
dot and what it looks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me like is the</font>

320
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,410
administrator is is too lazy to put each

321
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,160
of the zones that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been delegated</font>

322
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:39,259
into

323
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:41,240
separate zone files and give them their

324
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:43,779
own you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know eat ideally each's own</font>

325
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,940
should have its own file a known SOA

326
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:48,620
record and so on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead they take a</font>

327
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,170
shortcut and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a zone called</font>

328
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,379
calm and then they put each of their

329
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,899
delegated domains into their their<font color="#E5E5E5"> comms</font>

330
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,689
own and just lists one or 2a records and

331
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:01,399
I have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example on the next slide and</font>

332
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:04,819
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

333
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:07,220
source of most of the DNS poisoners that

334
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,780
we've found<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just looking at this</font>

335
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,549
example you may not come to this

336
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,168
conclusion but if you go to this

337
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:16,129
database that did you be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it</font>

338
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:18,679
in a bit you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would find that there's a</font>

339
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,510
lot of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular name server you</font>

340
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:25,549
know is authoritative for a lot of names

341
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:28,940
and not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> do they poison calm but</font>

342
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:30,559
they also poisoned net for.net<font color="#E5E5E5"> dames</font>

343
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,610
that they are for which they're

344
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:37,820
authoritative so here's my guess at what

345
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,850
their zone file probably looks like they

346
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,370
have an SOA record for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for calm they</font>

347
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:47,139
list their own name servers after that

348
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:50,678
and then they list a records for their

349
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,679
comm delegations

350
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,160
how much time<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I have</font>

351
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,840
you think I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right okay</font>

352
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:13,169
here's an example of what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might call</font>

353
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:16,039
stupidity this in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case it looks</font>

354
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:18,509
like there's two things going on one is

355
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,539
the comms own technique is being used

356
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:27,990
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're delegated names are put into</font>

357
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:33,269
a incorrect<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm zone but there's no dot</font>

358
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:36,960
after the NS record name so this

359
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:39,929
response shows that for the comms own

360
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,129
the authority servers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ns1 calm and</font>

361
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:49,169
s2 calm and s3 calm which have nothing

362
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:51,029
to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in s1 dot Frank's net there's</font>

363
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,519
an additional section here which shows

364
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:56,309
IP addresses for NS 1 comment as to calm

365
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,070
and n is 3 calm now if you if you go to

366
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:01,139
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> employee's name server and query for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">three name servers belong two entirely</font>

370
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:11,519
different organizations they're

371
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:13,408
unrelated this this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of example is</font>

372
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,259
rare but there are actually a lot of

373
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:18,840
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mistake that</font>

374
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:27,769
there's no trailing thought after the

375
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:30,539
name on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NS record so for evilness I</font>

376
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:32,369
actually had a hard time finding an

377
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:35,879
example where I could definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

378
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:38,668
this is this is somebody being evil my

379
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:41,759
definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an evil poisoning name</font>

380
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:43,559
server is one where it answers queries

381
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:47,129
that you know it shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be receiving</font>

382
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">it answers with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong IP address so</font>

383
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:50,789
if you queried for Google Google you

384
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,639
don't get Google's address you get

385
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:57,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else and it also may be</font>

386
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:59,219
proxies web traffic so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your you</font>

387
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:03,480
still get what you expect in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

388
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:05,309
browser so to help find these kind of

389
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,369
things I came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple</font>

390
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:10,860
ranking and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> every poisoning name</font>

391
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:12,510
server it gets a rating from one to five

392
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,490
one point each for

393
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:18,660
returning a bad referral that is just

394
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:23,140
being in our database poisoning a TLD

395
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">vs. poisoning the root zone answering an</font>

396
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:28,410
a query for one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote</font>

397
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:31,090
high-profile names that we queried

398
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,520
answering the query incorrectly gets it

399
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:37,149
another point and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally if the</font>

400
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,360
screenshot that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take looks like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

401
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:45,520
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing then then it gets another</font>

402
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:48,459
point so we found a few name servers

403

that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> rated at four but so far none</font>

that have been rated at five a few

miscellaneous notes here some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sources of poison that we found are</font>

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">name servers that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is their authoritative</font>

addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to being authoritative for some</font>

413
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,590
zone they're also used as caching

414
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:30,689
resolvers for clients at<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot so</font>

415
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:33,970
those clients have poisoned the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone and</font>

416
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:37,780
when we hit them they return the bad

417
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:40,090
referrals in the poison I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

418
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,639
emphasize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that having an authoritative</font>

419
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:45,040
name server<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept recursive queries is</font>

420
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:51,400
an incredibly bad idea in this is a

421
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:53,678
perfect example of why some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the NS</font>

422
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,600
records that we found during our survey

423
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:02,309
are the names are not fully qualified

424
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:06,750
the name NS is particularly popular so

425
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:09,010
that's sort of interesting because if a

426
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,830
caching name server becomes poisoned

427
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,929
with the referral to a name server

428
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,649
called NS it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to</font>

429
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:21,160
look up that name and the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

430
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,870
poisoning would not succeed and it's a

431
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even the</font>

432
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,750
vulnerable name server implementations

433
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:33,760
don't allow the root zone to be

434
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:36,820
I'm poisoned here's here's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

435

bottom line at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time there are</font>

436
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,570
currently several several hundred

437
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,980
misconfigured name servers out there

438
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:46,149
returning bad referrals<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can poison</font>

439
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:48,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Danish caches some of those perhaps with</font>

440
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:52,180
malicious intent but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say most do</font>

441
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:55,000
not about 75% of those try to poison the

442
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:57,730
root zone which usually has no effect

443
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,500
I'm not aware of any implementations

444
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that allow the the root zone to be</font>

445
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,710
poison but that doesn't mean that

446
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:07,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're there are some obscure ones out</font>

447
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:09,720
there probably ninety percent of the

448
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,860
caching name servers out there today are

449
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,340
running software that is not vulnerable

450
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say</font>

451
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the attempted poisoning or</font>

452
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,660
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cases where it looks like</font>

453
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:28,510
poisoning is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on can be attributed</font>

454
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:31,240
to laziness and stupidity here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the URL</font>

455
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:35,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this online database that we have</font>

456
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,570
and feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know ask me</font>

457
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,110
questions after the talk or later on

458
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,820
during the meeting and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want</font>

459
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:47,129
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> send me some email and we can</font>

460
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about this some more thanks</font>

461
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:01,170
friend or what<font color="#E5E5E5"> River domain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

462
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:05,080
questions what do you do with these

463
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:06,760
poison name servers and do you put to

464
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,090
abuse department or do you actually

465
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:14,370
black hole them and be how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often you run</font>

466
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,370
these scripts to avoid false positives

467
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,379
well I don't right now I don't do

468
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:23,379
anything with the the information that I

469
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,930
find except for put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this database</font>

470
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,470
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> accessible on that URL I did</font>

471
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:32,110
contact one technical contact for for

472
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:36,520
one of the cases that I found but I

473
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:38,469
didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> response from them and you</font>

474
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,050
know this has been talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about before I</font>

475
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,390
think in the past contacting people is

476
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,700
pretty hit-and-miss a lot of times you

477
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,350
just don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response but it's</font>

478
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:53,860
certainly something that you know should

479
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:56,139
be done but the second question what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

480
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,600
the second question how lofty run the

481
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:04,690
script other than false positive right

482
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:07,240
so we've I've run this survey a few

483
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,770
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past but not regularly my</font>

484
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,370
plan is to say run it every month now

485
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:13,870
from now on it takes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 days to go</font>

486
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:19,209
through the whole list of names that I

487
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:24,280
have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this point false positives is</font>

488
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:25,960
not I wouldn't I don't know I wouldn't

489
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">consider false positives sort of in the</font>

490
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,470
data I would say yeah things change over

491
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,560
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they may be easily block in</font>

492
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:34,420
yeah yeah and it's certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

493
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,580
that someone you know fixes their thing

494
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,620
and it gets taken out of the next result

495
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">said well i'll ping you offline maybe I</font>

496
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,870
can help okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

497
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,560
all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you okay</font>
