00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,520
very important and distinct and unique

7

organizations with us today that will

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,279
provide some

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,760
insight into what it is they do and why

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,760
it is they do it

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,519

and have them uh properly give an

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,640

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,600
labs like cz

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
and isc

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
and i am john kristoff i'm sort of

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,160

here and with that

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
let's get right into a discussion with

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,640
these esteemed colleagues of ours um

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,479

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,920
each of you and we'll go and order it

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,520
just because it's the order in the

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,040
screen that i have it'll be

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,280
jeff alex and andre

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
my first question for you is just if you

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,080
would just give us a relatively brief

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,680
introduction to

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,759
uh the the core systems that your

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,759
organization is involved in the software

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,920
systems that were sort of focused in on

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,880
today

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,799
some of you are involved in dns related

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,200
software routing software dhtp software

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
those sorts of things and then if you

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,479
would also

46
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,640
a brief overview of your organization

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,759
the structure the makeup the size

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,360
where you're locating that sort of thing

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,920
so jeff i'll let you start if you would

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
sure thank you very much

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,520
isc is the internet systems corporation

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,200
we've been around for

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,159
most of three decades we recently moved

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,000
from redwood city california to our

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
headquarters here in newmarket new

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,079
hampshire for no real reason other than

57
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,840
we had become

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,799
pretty much

59
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,240
a fully remote organization which given

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,560
the pandemic that we didn't realize was

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,599
calming was really um clever on our part

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,680
i wish i could take credit for it

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
we are currently in i believe 13

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,480
countries and 9 u.s states i'm probably

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,840
off a little because that's always

66
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
changing

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,480
and we are the developers of buy nine

68
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
isc dhcp

69
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,000
and isc kia fine nine is obviously one

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
of the more broadly used and vulnerable

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,599
uh dns software's out there it runs on

72
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,000
both recursive and authoritative name

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,560
servers around the world

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,239
the

75
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,800
another old product ise dhcp is in use

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
globally and has been for decades and

77
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,160
the newer product in the bunch isc kia

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,920
is a more current uh version of dhcp

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,080
that is receiving great news in the

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
marketplace and we just had our first uh

81
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,040
and very profitable year with that

82
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
product line last year so we're very

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,280
happy with it in addition we operate the

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
root server f

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
and

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,920
um do all of the

87
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
required things to work with icann and

88
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,040
the rsac in the pursuit of that

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,390
we're about 38 employees and

90
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,560
[Music]

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,319
we just published our results for last

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,760
year we're just under seven million

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,200
dollars and we're very profitable to

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,319
have a bunch of money in the bank

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,879
very happy about that

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,920
it's one of the things i like to also

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,000
get a sense of with with each of your

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
organizations they're somewhat unique

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
and that they're both the size and the

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,599
sort of makeup of them

101
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,120
i think you're all reasonably in some

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,200
sense a non-profit you work for sort of

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,720
the betterment of the community in a

104
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
sense the internet community and so i i

105
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,799
see if i'm not mistaken as operates as a

106
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
non-profit us federal nonprofit is that

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,040
correct i can't believe i missed that

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
but you made me go first so i didn't get

109
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,680
any hints we are and have been for

110
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,640
decades a um 501c3

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,879
charitable organization under

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,680
irs regulation and us law

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,319
and alex if if you would go next please

114
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,200
yeah um i'm alex i work for uh the

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
anonymous labs foundation which is also

116
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,840
a 501 c3

117
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,959
we were founded in 1999 as a research

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,560
and development company

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,639
that actually sparked out of the sale of

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
the nlnet isp

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
so that was basically the first internet

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
service provider in the netherlands that

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,520
that had like uh um the countrywide

124
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,639
coverage

125
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,800
um it was sold in the internet bubble

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,759
and with the money from that the dnl

127
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,479
atlanta foundation was set up

128
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,120
with a mission to provide open source

129
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,360
core infrastructure tooling for dns and

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,759
bgp

131
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,040
and then

132
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,639
basically from the start of that

133
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,800
we first worked on the authoritative

134
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,280
name server nsd uh in 2007 uh we added

135
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,360
unbound recursive resolver

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,240
a little bit later open dns uh dns

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,120
signer and in recent years we've been

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,320
venturing more deeply into providing pgp

139
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,400
security software so

140
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,880
currently we have krill rpki certificate

141
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,759
authority software and routernator

142
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,520
which is rpi relying party software

143
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,400
yeah the

144
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
organization currently consists of about

145
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,919
uh 15 people which is 12 developers two

146
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,000
researchers and and basically two

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
managers to keep the lights on

148
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,440
um

149
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,840
and yeah so that makes it a really flat

150
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,199
organization

151
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,520
um

152
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,759
yeah so everything we do is basically

153
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,039
open source uh liberally licensed uh

154
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,320
free software

155
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,000
um and

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,840
we have a lot of connections and we are

157
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,639
very active in promoting open standards

158
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,440
and and open source development so we're

159
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,479
active in itf and and icann and all

160
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,919
kinds of other uh fora to sort of uh

161
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,280
promote the improvement of the security

162
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,520
and the stability of the internet

163
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,280
thank you alex

164
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,440
thank you andre your all of your

165
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,800
organizations are

166
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
very unique in their own way

167
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,919
yours even maybe more so among the three

168
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,400
of you i think it may be fair to say you

169
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
started not necessarily as a software

170
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,840
organization correct but there's a lot

171
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,600
of that core software that you're

172
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,120
involved in so tell us a little bit

173
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,240
about

174
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,479
what you do and your perspective of your

175
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,039
organization compared to the others

176
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,199
okay thank you so sis i think unlike the

177
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,680
others is a is an association probably

178
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
not for profit but we are based in the

179
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,759
czech republic in prague so we have a

180
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,759
little bit different status and

181
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,080
the main purpose of existence of this

182
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,280
company was to maintain and you know

183
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
be a registry of domain.czed

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,039
the national domain of the czech

185
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,960
republic so

186
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
when we started you know uh the story

187
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,520
began with the fact that nobody actually

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,960
had the

189
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,280
knowledge how to run the domain so first

190
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
in first you know five years of the

191
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,039
existence we outsourced

192
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,199
uh the administration of the domain i

193
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,599
mean the technical solution

194
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
and then you know we developed our own

195
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,800
system that was basically the first

196
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
software development we did and when we

197
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
made it we realized that there might be

198
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
some other countries some other tlds

199
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
that have the same situation so

200
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
now the first software we release is an

201
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,639
open source or registry system which we

202
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,039
by the way support up-to-date and it's

203
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,599
it's used by many countries worldwide uh

204
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,400
including latin america africa uh asia

205
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,960
and so on so it was the first software

206
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
that varies as an open source and then

207
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,680
uh you know

208
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,599
the goal was done you know we knew that

209
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,840
the software is running the domain is in

210
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
super perfect shape and

211
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,319
and we were we asked ourselves what was

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,919
going to be next and we said we would

213
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,520
like to do something for the good of the

214
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,560
internet

215
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,440
and

216
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,680
we started a part of our company which

217
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,000
is called seasoned labs that started to

218
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,360
produce open source which is which

219
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,599
you know has uh some which can be used

220
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,240
by others so first was adoption uh

221
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,319
because you know they the projects

222
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,720
itself is is much older adoption of of

223
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,520
uh

224
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,800
rooting them on

225
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,599
bird uh which actually i found it

226
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,000
as a university project long time ago

227
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
but now it's developed by seasoning and

228
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
you know uh this software is quite

229
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,000
widely used uh

230
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319
especially in the exchange board or cdns

231
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,320
and and companies like that

232
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,120
and then because you we are a dns

233
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,360
running company of course we started to

234
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,719
develop uh two dns demons first was the

235
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,279
authoritative not dns and then not

236
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,880
resolver

237
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,760
and

238
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,800
then we

239
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
we do a lot of other software but this

240
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
is probably not super relevant for the

241
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
for the nano audience but we also do for

242
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,200
example some educational games for for

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,640
people with uh

244
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,560
mainly child children with

245
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
some disabilities and so on but but

246
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
those four main projects that are

247
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,080
probably interesting for for the

248
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
audience

249
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,160
um yeah and that's probably about us we

250
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,640
have about 200 120 130 employees mostly

251
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,279
based in prague czech republic but as i

252
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,519
said this group is much broader we also

253
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,519
run a national assert of the czech

254
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,360
republic we also

255
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
do some identification system for the

256
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
country and so on so

257
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
not everybody is just developing those

258
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
open source tools thanks very much and

259
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
one of the themes i hope that will be

260
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
obvious running across each

261
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,279
organizations is dns software clearly

262
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,360
routing for most of you

263
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,399
and then

264
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,680
a couple of other things like running

265
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,320
some operational services there's some

266
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,279
themes

267
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,120
and it would be interesting if we had a

268
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
way to graph the size of your

269
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
organization's number of people maybe

270
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
the revenue that you're able to

271
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,080
pull in compared to some other

272
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,839
organizations some of these big

273
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,760
conglomerate commercial companies and

274
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,279
the contributions that your

275
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,839
organizations make and what you do with

276
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,120
so little compared to some of these

277
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,839
other giant companies i think would be a

278
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,279
fascinating comparison

279
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
well let me start with some individual

280
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,959
questions now i'll start with you alex

281
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,000
um because you and i actually

282
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
uh had a brief interaction much longer

283
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,480
that actually led to this discussion um

284
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,079
i was privileged to some comments that

285
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,920
you had made about

286
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,200
um

287
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,680
how much actual support you get through

288
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,480
the

289
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,760
uh contracts for rpki related software

290
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,200
and

291
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
the projects that you do and that's

292
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
actually a relatively small part of

293
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
the revenue that you take in

294
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
um so my first question is you know what

295
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,320
is it that

296
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,279
uh because that was i assume uh a

297
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,399
project

298
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,800
the rpki related work that you're doing

299
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,160
something that you got into necessarily

300
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,560
because you saw dollar signs

301
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,399
but there's something beyond that that

302
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,079
was important for you to do why how did

303
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,839
you come to that decision why did you do

304
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,640
it um and how do you actually

305
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,200
how does one fund work like that when

306
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,279
when the money isn't necessarily coming

307
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
in directly from our projects

308
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
yeah immediately for the support

309
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,680
contracts

310
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,120
well give let me give you a little bit

311
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,160
of context to to how that works so um as

312
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,240
i said in my introduction an online

313
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,600
class was founded by basically the the

314
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
income the revenue that was that came in

315
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,480
from the sale of the elnett isp

316
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,839
but

317
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,079
uh an illnet labs itself has been

318
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,000
self-sustaining

319
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,040
for well over a decade so basically all

320
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
of the money that we make

321
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,800
is

322
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,320
funded by the

323
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,560
users of our software

324
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,480
so we make it for the community and the

325
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,399
entire organization is funded by the

326
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,440
community so i always think to myself of

327
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,040
this this sort of xkcd comic where uh

328
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
open source software

329
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,600
um is developed by some thankless person

330
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,320
in nebraska since 2003 with no income

331
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,240
and you have no idea if it's going to be

332
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,440
around

333
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,519
the next day maybe you'll just give up

334
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,680
and

335
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
think it's no fun anymore

336
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,120
um but for us this is uh like like daily

337
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,760
business we we make software that is

338
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,600
continuously developed with regular

339
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,839
releases

340
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,040
and

341
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,200
the tax regulations actually allow us to

342
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,839
have two years of reserves

343
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,680
to sustain

344
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,000
the foundation so should the internet

345
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,040
community decide to not fund us anymore

346
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,959
then basically we can keep operations

347
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,040
running for two years we'll send out an

348
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
announcement and people can then migrate

349
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
to some other solution well ahead of

350
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
time so they know they're using a

351
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,800
well-supported solution

352
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
now

353
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,440
basically nsd and unbound

354
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,240
they were developed with

355
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
the money that we still had from the

356
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,519
sale of a nomad

357
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,639
and

358
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,440
with that we the internet community saw

359
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
that we actually had like a

360
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,240
um

361
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,639
a well-maintained solution

362
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,040
and when we transitioned to funding it

363
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,560
ourselves the internet community was

364
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,079
actually like okay how can we find

365
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,200
different ways of making sure that this

366
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,519
the we guarantee the continued

367
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,800
development

368
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,639
of these tools

369
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,720
and basically there's a couple of ways

370
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,360
so uh there's donations to the

371
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,240
foundation you can just give us money um

372
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,079
we also get grants for research and

373
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,279
development

374
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,200
so certain features or searching tooling

375
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,959
or sort of research is done basically

376
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,160
with the grants

377
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
that we get from a organization

378
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,760
um we have paid feature development so

379
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,040
an organization can just say uh

380
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,519
can we just pay you to develop this

381
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,079
particular feature in one of your tools

382
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,480
um because that would be really useful

383
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,720
to have within our organization

384
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,399
and we don't actually

385
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,320
we actually think it's a good idea for

386
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
this functionality to be available to

387
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,079
the wider community and the last thing

388
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,600
that we provide is

389
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,079
is a support contract so we really have

390
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,399
like sla support contracts

391
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,360
giving people access to for example

392
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,279
vulnerability information under an nda

393
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,519
so we give people

394
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,160
information about security leaks and

395
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
they get patches before they're made

396
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,760
public

397
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,519
and basically these are the four ways

398
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,120
that we generate

399
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,959
income

400
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,199
with which we're able to to

401
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,680
set up a sustainable revenue to keep

402
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,639
going i think our our budget is kind of

403
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,040
small i think it's about

404
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,480
one and a half 1.8 million uh which

405
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,399
you know with 15 uh uh full-time staff

406
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,040
um is really not that that much if you

407
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
count in like office and all of the

408
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,639
other expenses uh that you would have

409
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,279
does that answer a question

410
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,040
yes i think i think so we're going to

411
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,959
also leave plenty of time for q a too so

412
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,760
if i

413
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,040
if we miss something we'll let the

414
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
audience ask the tougher questions

415
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,600
that's okay jeff i'll move on to you if

416
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,399
i could

417
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,240
um one of the the interesting things

418
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,279
especially with your organizations

419
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,639
you've had some projects and some

420
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,639
i guess some some other sorts of things

421
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,240
affiliated with ic over there is a sort

422
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
of common gone there was buying 10 for

423
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,800
instance a classic example dns arc was

424
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,560
part of isc farsight was rolled out of

425
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,720
your group you had a short arrangement

426
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,560
with the free range routing project for

427
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,600
a time

428
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,440
how do you decide

429
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,199
what what to do with certain projects

430
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,680
like to shut them down or to transition

431
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,000
them how so i imagine it's not always

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,680
easy but maybe take us through perhaps

433
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,279
an example of how you come to those

434
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,360
sorts of decisions

435
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,240
what an interesting question

436
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,079
one of the things i miss about not

437
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,720
getting together in actual conferences

438
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,120
is having somebody ask me that at the

439
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,600
beginning of a meal i'm paying for and

440
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,759
realizing i have a great story to roll

441
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,759
out over the next hour so i'll try to

442
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,399
keep this more terse

443
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,880
i was actually involved with isc back

444
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,959
from the beginning i'd been a senior

445
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,839
executive with isc with uunet

446
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,120
technologies which really made them the

447
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,399
first major funding that started isc

448
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,839
back in the day

449
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,839
so had been very familiar with it was

450
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,600
literally in the room when some checks

451
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,120
were written and

452
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,959
have sort of been watching it from the

453
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,959
side nine years ago i'd been i sold a 3d

454
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,720
printing company and was looking for

455
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,079
something to do

456
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,000
and rick adams the longtime chairman of

457
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,360
of isc sat me down and said i have a

458
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,560
consulting project with a problem child

459
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,320
could you take a look at it and see what

460
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,519
you think

461
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,880
and if you think you can make up

462
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,120
something of it would you like to run it

463
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,199
and i thought my god that's an offer so

464
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,839
i went for a couple of weeks and went

465
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,800
back to him and said

466
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,519
they're scattered all over the map how

467
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,279
the hell do they make money and he said

468
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,680
we don't we write them a huge check

469
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
every year and

470
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,280
hope they get it better

471
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,119
so um

472
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
i was either dumb enough or lucky enough

473
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,240
to

474
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,000
take it on and in

475
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,959
the end of 2013 they gave me the job at

476
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,559
the of running the place at the time

477
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,199
they had about 60 employees working on

478
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,119
about 30 products

479
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,959
i don't think any of them by themselves

480
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,199
were actually profitable the revenue

481
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,039
model was

482
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,160
convoluted in the extreme and at the end

483
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,480
of every year the board was begged for

484
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
between one to four million dollars and

485
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,320
so the place kept afloat

486
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,679
so um

487
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,919
i'm still disliked in some circles

488
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,440
because within about three months of

489
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,600
taking over i let about a quarter of the

490
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,960
company go

491
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,559
with a three-month severance and good

492
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,320
references and i'm really proud that i

493
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
think everybody had a job in less than

494
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,520
three months but that was hard to do

495
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,320
we also at the time um

496
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,760
there's a great quote from the board of

497
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,320
directors when they said about buying 10

498
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,480
it's an abortion

499
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,760
so

500
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,840
we took a look at it did a code review

501
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,280
went through it realized how much

502
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,760
apologizing i was going to do i bought

503
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,160
knee pads by the gross

504
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
and killed it

505
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,760
and then went around apologizing um

506
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,080
that was a tough year 60 employees

507
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,640
losing 1 to 4 million a year on 30

508
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,039
products half of which the developers

509
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,559
couldn't explain to me just what they

510
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,200
were so by

511
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,039
about the end of 2014 we were down to

512
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,880
pretty much a core three or four

513
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080
products

514
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,840
um we were in the low 30 employees

515
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,960
we were down from a money losing 8 or 10

516
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,160
million to a money-making break even 5

517
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,840
million and sort of since then

518
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,679
we've just been trying to improve what

519
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,080
we're doing um similar to what alex

520
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,559
described we basically

521
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,280
sell support services to the users of

522
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,799
our software

523
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,990
and give them slas and responsive um

524
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,080
[Music]

525
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,720
we actually had to share this with nl

526
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
net labs we get along pretty well with

527
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,000
those guys so we have fixed their stuff

528
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,559
and they've fixed ours and it's it's a

529
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,280
very nice relationship similarly andre's

530
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,080
organization and ours um i think work

531
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,520
very closely together and very

532
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,280
cooperative so it's important to

533
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
recognize this group of people is a

534
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,080
group of colleagues and friends rather

535
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,880
than

536
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,200
some fierce competitors

537
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,520
so the current situation again i'll say

538
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,760
we were so fortunate we just finished

539
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
our final results we did just under

540
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,919
seven million dollars

541
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,720
we literally had a profit of

542
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,600
almost one million dollars

543
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,840
we stuck it in the bank we're very proud

544
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
to have cash reserves of about four

545
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,720
million dollars when i came on

546
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,160
we didn't have two weeks payroll

547
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,280
we currently have most of a year

548
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,520
so

549
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,840
thanks to

550
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,360
cooperating with the other people in the

551
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,240
business and the kindness and generosity

552
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,919
of a lot of big companies and government

553
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,880
organizations that are recognizing

554
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,039
open source isn't free

555
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,280
and as alex said that guy in nebraska

556
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,679
writing that code somebody needs to take

557
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,400
care of him so at least in the case of

558
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
bind dhcp kia and one of the root

559
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,520
servers

560
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
we figured out a method where we think

561
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,200
we have a sustainable way

562
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,120
to pay for it but we're extremely

563
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
empathetic to the difficulty of the

564
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,960
other organizations doing it and i would

565
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,880
love i think we're strong enough i would

566
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,559
love to adopt

567
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,200
some poor bastards doing an open source

568
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,679
thing and not quite making it i would

569
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,720
love to pick somebody up and help them

570
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,000
make it better

571
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,240
thanks for that very much jeff i'll tell

572
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,679
the audience hopefully this airs with

573
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,039
plenty of time where

574
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,799
people actually get to see jeff he'll be

575
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,200
there in austin by the time this is

576
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
presented and maybe they'll take you up

577
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,960
on that offer for that long lunch with

578
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,159
some stories

579
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,159
i promise to say nice things about alex

580
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,760
and andre and their organizations i'll

581
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,720
represent well guys yeah and thanks for

582
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
mentioning that we're such good friends

583
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,159
it's it's nice to see that that that we

584
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,960
can sort of co-exist uh in such a

585
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,120
collaborative and friendly way it's uh

586
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,000
it's it's really awesome

587
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,360
yeah that's true thank you for that

588
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,760
andrea let me ask you a question now

589
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,159
one of the i don't know how if this is

590
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,159
um

591
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,159
has affected you maybe so much as maybe

592
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,679
some of the others maybe particularly

593
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,600
with isc i know for sure

594
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,679
um commercial organizations sometimes

595
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,080
come along and through the the

596
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,760
development that you've or your

597
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,400
organization has done will often adapt

598
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
because it's open source so they'll

599
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
build something around what you've done

600
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,960
push you know a shiny bow on it and sell

601
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,480
it as something a little bit different

602
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,360
and maybe tout their ability as a bigger

603
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,280
organization perhaps or because they

604
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,039
have some other resource behind them to

605
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,720
enhance in some way

606
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,320
and maybe make a whole lot of money

607
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,159
maybe a lot more money

608
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,320
than maybe you've been making or would

609
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,679
make on it

610
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,000
um what do you think about that is that

611
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,520
beneficial to you does that help you

612
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,960
what's good or bad about those

613
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,880
situations when that may happen with the

614
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,440
work that your groups do yeah the story

615
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,520
you described happened quite it was

616
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,320
quite often actually so uh i i know

617
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,080
several companies that made a product

618
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,600
around our products and and then

619
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,559
do not pay any any single dollar back so

620
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,400
of course i feel

621
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,960
bad about it because uh you know i must

622
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,520
say i must go to jeff's numbers that he

623
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,280
presented we are definitely not in the

624
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,240
same position uh we have the luxury that

625
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,400
the caesar registry subsidize

626
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,480
this you know this development

627
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,120
uh so that's that guarantees the the

628
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
stability on the other hand of course it

629
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,240
doesn't say it has to be forever and and

630
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,080
also it's probably not super fair that

631
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,000
you know people from the czech republic

632
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,480
subsidize the the open source which is

633
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,320
which is used around the globe

634
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,200
uh and this is exactly the point that uh

635
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,679
sometimes uh you know some companies

636
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,880
just take the product uh make something

637
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,919
shiny around it and sell it better

638
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,840
and there's no way how we can protect it

639
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,919
if we would like to continue with our

640
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,919
mantra that we do everything open source

641
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:24,720
so

642
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,200
uh we do similar things like like my

643
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
colleagues you know we we sell the

644
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,520
support contracts we we you know give

645
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,159
early security warnings and patches and

646
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,760
so on uh but you know one of the big

647
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,400
companies that you all know that i will

648
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
not name it just told me you know i

649
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,000
would like to buy that support contract

650
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
but your software just works so why

651
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,799
would i do that

652
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,279
it was it was a strange moment for me

653
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,600
because i had no answer you know i just

654
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,279
you know told him

655
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,039
and and probably uh

656
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,400
maybe the perception will be a little

657
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
bit different with with the lock for jay

658
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,919
curse because

659
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,880
you know

660
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,039
there was a software component that was

661
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,200
wrong and everybody was using and nobody

662
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,279
was very wet and nobody paid for it and

663
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,400
it was just developed by volunteers who

664
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
uh you know if this happens cannot be as

665
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,240
quick and and of course if they don't

666
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,080
have enough money they cannot support

667
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,520
everybody so

668
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,600
i'm trying to

669
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,279
to say the same story it's beneficial

670
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,919
for you to to support software you use

671
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,360
because you know if something bad

672
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,480
happens

673
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,799
it will definitely help you if if you

674
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,039
are well finance if you are not

675
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,840
then

676
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,240
i think it's it's bad for everybody so

677
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,799
yes that's my feelings for that alex

678
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
back to you one of the

679
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,760
um

680
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,840
challenges i i think there's a certain

681
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,120
number of them that may be unique to

682
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
your organizations but there's certainly

683
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,480
a lot of things in common between your

684
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,600
organization other commercial

685
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,080
organizations and other non-profits

686
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,480
but from your perspective what

687
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,440
are is unique of a challenge is it is it

688
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
funding is it is it hiring people are

689
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,520
you do is it more difficult to to pay

690
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,200
the kinds of salaries

691
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,840
um that you maybe would like to pay

692
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,720
um is it marketing um because you know

693
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,400
most of your staff from maybe technical

694
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,640
you know what what's unique to

695
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,600
your organization that you face

696
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,640
um

697
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,240
i think a lot of the things that you

698
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,679
named are actually problems so uh

699
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,320
hiring is an issue i can't afford what

700
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,159
some of the bigger organizations can

701
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,200
afford

702
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,360
even though you know all of the staff

703
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,400
that we have could easily get a job at

704
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
a

705
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,640
a huge conglomerate that that can pay

706
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,039
them twice three times as much and they

707
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,520
have the talent for it as well

708
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
to achieve that level

709
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,600
a lot of the tools that we make it's the

710
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
quality is just so high so

711
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,120
similar to what andre said

712
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,880
we don't have a lot of cves we don't

713
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,039
have a lot of security problems with our

714
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,720
software so we also get the question

715
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,880
like why would i get a support contract

716
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,600
and

717
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,400
uh organizations don't realize that

718
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,200
to achieve this level of quality

719
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,480
and this level of maintenance is is

720
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,880
that's why you need to support contracts

721
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,520
that that's why we need funding

722
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,400
in order to prevent those uh issues from

723
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,240
happening in the first place

724
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,360
um

725
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,080
so so getting a support contract is also

726
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,679
a contribution to the continued

727
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,960
development

728
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,840
of the software itself so

729
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,640
hiring is an issue marketing

730
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,360
not so much i think within the internet

731
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,520
industry i think all of the three

732
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,159
organizations here are very well known

733
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,320
if you need an open source dns solution

734
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,240
or you would ask anybody in the nano

735
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,480
audience like can you name a dns

736
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,840
resolver

737
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,720
probably the three names of ours will

738
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,559
come out and people know to my heart so

739
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,080
so i don't think marketing is the

740
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,440
biggest issue

741
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,720
um

742
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,799
so in order for

743
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,279
us to hire people we have to offer

744
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,799
something unique

745
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,240
uh

746
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,159
and that is both an advantage and a

747
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,919
disadvantage because

748
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,159
we're kind of small flat we don't have

749
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,240
any politics

750
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,320
we don't have any hierarchy no account

751
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,360
manager breathing down your neck um so

752
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,760
developers can really just focus on what

753
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,000
they're good at and and work in an

754
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,720
environment that they think is very nice

755
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,120
uh get to be responsible for their

756
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,480
project you know

757
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,240
um even down to sort of naming it uh

758
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,880
coming up with with uh when you release

759
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,039
what the release name is which features

760
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,520
you build it's all collaborative there's

761
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,679
nobody sort of telling you what to make

762
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,200
how to make it

763
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,240
um

764
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,039
and

765
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,360
that kind of environment sort of entices

766
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,600
certain developers to want to work for

767
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
helmet labs so

768
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,120
um

769
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,679
hiring takes a long time

770
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,399
to find just the right kind of person to

771
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,120
fit within the organization

772
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,960
but ultimately we do uh

773
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,120
if we would have an opportunity to let

774
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,440
the company grow to like with

775
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,600
an additional 10 developers

776
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,799
that would actually be kind of

777
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,360
problematic so finding that many people

778
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,600
in a reasonable amount of time i don't

779
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,159
think that's really doable but this slow

780
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,720
and sort of gradual growth

781
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,159
in the way that we've been doing over

782
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,880
the last couple of years is absolutely

783
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
uh doable

784
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,080
but

785
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
right now we're with like 15 people in

786
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,880
march we'll have 16

787
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,200
um i don't think that the structure that

788
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
we have as an organization is really

789
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,559
sustainable

790
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,600
above like 20 maybe 25

791
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,760
maybe at that point you start needing

792
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,919
like middle managers little project

793
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,279
groups and

794
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,600
we lose some of the magic that makes it

795
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
loud special

796
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,360
which is probably different for

797
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,640
the other people

798
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,200
here in the panel my guess would be for

799
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,080
all of you anyone who works there or

800
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,480
wants to work there there's some

801
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,720
you know real desire to want to work

802
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,480
with you and be part of the organization

803
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,919
because you're relatively small and

804
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,440
there's some prestige associated with

805
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,279
being involved in what you do is i

806
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,960
assume that's a fair

807
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,000
statement for all of you yes

808
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,279
yeah

809
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,279
not many people can say they were you

810
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,279
know a core lead developer and a piece

811
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,039
of software an organization like yours

812
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,200
if you say you you know i helped build

813
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,880
out this cloud network well you're

814
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,320
probably one of hundreds of people who

815
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,440
helped do that at some of these large

816
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
organizations right so it's it's very

817
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,200
meaningful i would assume

818
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,799
to be a part of it

819
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,240
i think one of the things i would like

820
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,679
to add is uh the some of the larger

821
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,679
organizations that that

822
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,679
i think you can all name all of the

823
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,679
bigger ones that that are large players

824
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,039
on the internet they sort of have to

825
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,880
have this reputation of not wanting to

826
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,760
support open source

827
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,720
uh

828
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,440
but i've actually found the opposite

829
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,799
uh

830
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,240
we have uh i i can be open about this we

831
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
have about 50 organizations supporting

832
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,960
us

833
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,840
and perhaps thousands tens of hundreds

834
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,200
of thousands of organizations that use

835
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,919
software like unbound

836
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,440
and it's only funded by a handful

837
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,360
and all of those larger organizations

838
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,880
that you know

839
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,000
they are part of of making that happen

840
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
um

841
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,240
that's

842
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
absolutely fantastic but at the same

843
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,720
time also a little bit scary because it

844
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,240
means that if i would lose like five or

845
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,120
eight

846
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,039
uh that would actually have a really big

847
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,960
impact on uh our organization so i think

848
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,120
our biggest mission is to

849
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,080
uh

850
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,880
not to grow as an organization uh and

851
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,360
not to make a huge amount of money

852
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,440
i just would like the income to be

853
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,360
spread a little bit more over more

854
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,600
organizations so i could even

855
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,000
maybe lower the support contract costs

856
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,440
or or

857
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,200
not be so dependent uh on donations

858
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,120
to our organization to sort of make it

859
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,919
sustainable and also over the last sort

860
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,360
of five to six years that's been

861
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,960
improving a lot

862
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,519
but it is uh my biggest concern at this

863
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,039
moment yeah

864
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,559
everyone's nodding their heads so it

865
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,519
looks like you're all in violent

866
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,720
agreement that you

867
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,320
face relatively the same situation

868
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,360
do you want to see something jeff you

869
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,720
look like you're about to

870
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,200
yeah um alex is bringing up the

871
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,799
interesting point and this is where it's

872
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,559
more interesting with eight people at a

873
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,240
dinner table instead of trying to speak

874
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,799
to a large crowd

875
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,440
non-interactively

876
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,840
we have a couple of unique positions one

877
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,080
of my favorites is

878
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,640
there are no shareholders

879
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,080
most people are unaware of what a

880
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,799
non-profit 501c3 means it doesn't mean

881
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,640
you don't have a profit we had a profit

882
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,399
last year we're happy about it it means

883
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,399
you don't have a shareholder

884
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,120
so there's no guy going i demand a five

885
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,320
percent increase in my take it's the

886
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,159
board saying you guys aren't running out

887
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,679
of money right we got no and they go

888
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,760
excellent and then everybody on staff

889
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,600
saying we get our jobs for another year

890
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,120
or two right i go yeah and they go

891
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,559
excellent so the level of concern like

892
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,399
alex talked about the level they're at

893
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,200
being good we're at the we're at the 35

894
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,240
to 40 person level and we really like it

895
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,000
i have 10 people who work for me and

896
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,720
each of them has one layer so nobody's

897
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
real far away people can talk to me

898
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,720
directly anytime and if we got bigger

899
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,600
we'd add management and that kind of

900
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,760
that sucks because

901
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,039
most of us

902
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,480
most of us in this company had

903
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,640
successful careers with big companies

904
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,279
made enough money to recognize i can

905
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,840
afford to work for a non-profit we don't

906
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,720
pay

907
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,880
poor wages we really

908
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,960
pay pretty well and i'm happy about it

909
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
but at the end of the day

910
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,799
if you've ever worked for a commercial

911
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,320
software company

912
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,159
i can remember being told by the

913
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,360
president

914
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,640
we're shipping

915
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
and i'd say it's not ready and then

916
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,240
you're gonna harm people and they'd say

917
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,399
if you're not ashamed of what you're

918
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,840
shipping you're shipping too late

919
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,399
that doesn't happen at isc and it

920
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,760
doesn't have to

921
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,720
we're late on 9.18 and the guys are

922
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,320
killing themselves going i wanted to get

923
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,799
it out last week and i keep going

924
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,120
get it right

925
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,799
it doesn't matter nobody's going to come

926
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,440
from the board now dare say how dare you

927
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,399
no

928
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,480
venture capital fund is demanding

929
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
another eight percent return

930
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,360
if

931
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,360
we the employees of the company don't

932
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,720
think this is the right thing for the

933
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,559
internet

934
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,960
it doesn't matter and so that's it's a

935
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,480
really nice

936
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,960
position to be in where

937
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,519
literally the sole motivation is

938
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,679
let's make enough money that we get paid

939
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,600
and then secondly let's do the right

940
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,760
thing the third interesting thing alex

941
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,240
pointed out is at one point we had we

942
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,799
believed about a million users not end

943
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,600
users but operators of bind

944
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,519
and about 102 paying support customers

945
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,200
that is 10

946
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,640
to one

947
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
so a consultant will come in and go how

948
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,520
do you get more people using your

949
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,599
software i don't want it

950
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,079
i just wanna have one out of

951
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,560
nine thousand and five hundred pay me

952
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,040
instead of ten thousand and they go i

953
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,239
don't know how to do that i said well

954
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,000
thanks that's that's what we're working

955
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,199
on so we are improving that we you guys

956
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,199
have gotten so much additional stuff we

957
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,599
probably have a slightly reduced

958
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,000
installed base but now we have several

959
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,639
hundred people paying us so it's it's a

960
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,760
yield question and the yield one is fun

961
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,159
because it's not use my software it's

962
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,719
you're using my software

963
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,040
um

964
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,399
um

965
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,320
well i'll say don't be a dick i mean

966
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,239
basically that the sales pitch is just

967
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,159
don't be a dick let's be nice

968
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,239
and to the degree that you're supporting

969
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,159
something you use it's good the one

970
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,960
other plug i'd say is we changed to an

971
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,480
mpl 2.0 license about four years ago and

972
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
i think it helped because we were

973
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,960
previously in a bdsd derivative called

974
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,359
the isc license and i guess andre you

975
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,920
guys are more of a gpl but the the fact

976
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,240
that our license means you can change it

977
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,720
and improve it if you're an oem but you

978
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,359
owe it back to the world or as literally

979
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,640
richard stallman came up with in like 86

980
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,960
hey get an exception license pay a bunch

981
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,200
of money and it's exclusively yours but

982
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,960
you're paying a bunch of money to the

983
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,800
developers

984
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,040
seems legit to me so

985
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,200
uh if peop for people who haven't moved

986
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,839
yet the mpl 200 license really

987
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,480
um can be a very valuable thing i think

988
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,839
and i think it keeps absolutely the core

989
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,359
concept of

990
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,760
open source alive it just gives you a

991
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,440
little more flexibility

992
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
maybe to follow up on that i'll direct

993
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,800
this to you andre but it's not

994
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,040
specifically um to you it's just your

995
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,880
turn

996
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,040
because of the way you operate all your

997
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,720
organizations with in more of the open

998
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,480
source realm as opposed to companies

999
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,560
whose co-intended proprietary not really

1000
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,640
accessible to anyone to to look at

1001
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,320
modify or adapt

1002
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,400
do you find between your organizations

1003
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,119
you're able to take or examine some one

1004
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,680
of your colleagues software alex or

1005
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,599
just for instance and say that's a

1006
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,040
pretty good idea or that's a neat trick

1007
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,440
or do developers actually kind of

1008
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
creatively borrow things from each other

1009
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,880
back and forth or does that not happen

1010
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,340
maybe as much as we might expect

1011
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:37,920
[Laughter]

1012
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,280
i hit a nerve here maybe

1013
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,200
if you're talking you're on mutes

1014
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,359
yeah sorry i i was just thinking what

1015
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,839
was the question if you can you know

1016
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,640
stop it for a while

1017
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,560
well and maybe this is to all of you i

1018
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,480
mean because the nature of your software

1019
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,320
is open source everyone can see it and

1020
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,160
people do adapt it but between your

1021
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
organizations for instance you all have

1022
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,760
dns software

1023
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,680
um

1024
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
how common might it be or how often

1025
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,280
might happen or does it happen at all

1026
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,040
where someone implements some new

1027
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,040
feature for the first time and and if

1028
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,480
one of your developers needs to also

1029
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,720
implement that feature how much creative

1030
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,079
borrowing of that you know

1031
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,160
implementation is there oh do you not

1032
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,480
look at it or do you say that's a pretty

1033
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,680
idea i'm going to use that track you

1034
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,520
know how much of that goes on that's

1035
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
that's a perfect question because it it

1036
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,920
happens sometimes that you know somebody

1037
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,800
comes with some feature and of course uh

1038
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,640
it sounds like a super selling point for

1039
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,280
the others so so we need to implement it

1040
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,520
and so on happens quite often

1041
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,560
uh

1042
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,839
i think as especially the kind of uh

1043
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,440
race uh of you know between you know of

1044
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,200
the speed between those implementation

1045
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,320
and so on so yeah happens quite often

1046
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
but honestly uh we are quite religious

1047
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,920
in this so we

1048
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,320
definitely do not look into the other's

1049
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,200
code

1050
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,960
try we try to avoid it because that's

1051
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,839
very dangerous you know uh

1052
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,520
i always and

1053
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,880
you know

1054
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,040
say to people if you build something and

1055
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,359
you will just on all software

1056
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,280
try the others you know because you know

1057
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,040
make it heterogeneous because it's very

1058
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,880
dangerous to build software just on one

1059
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,240
single software

1060
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,800
in dna's world it's it's much better but

1061
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,960
for example with birth uh the problem is

1062
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,000
that uh

1063
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,640
now the most uh the the super majority

1064
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,880
of exchange point uh use both as a road

1065
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,839
server

1066
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,920
and there is usually no alternative

1067
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,760
especially those big guys they just use

1068
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,599
birds so and i so always say that's a

1069
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,160
very dangerous situation we we really

1070
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,200
need to have a second usable uh

1071
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,160
implementation of bgp

1072
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,040
and

1073
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,359
that's a problem so

1074
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,640
yes uh

1075
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,440
uh

1076
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
we are inspired by the others that's for

1077
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,400
sure we very closely look at them uh we

1078
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,079
even sometimes meet or

1079
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,839
at least when when the world was normal

1080
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,440
we were used to it

1081
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,880
and we discussed

1082
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,760
uh but we really try to avoid stealing

1083
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
the code and and even read the the

1084
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,520
others code that's because that's very

1085
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,480
dangerous you know they um

1086
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,920
there was a lot of examples in the

1087
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,000
history when you know code was shared

1088
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
and then a single black just just you

1089
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,800
know destroyed everything so we really

1090
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,960
strictly avoid this trust me or not

1091
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,440
that's true

1092
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,359
i have every reason to trust you that's

1093
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,040
actually interesting that they do make

1094
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,640
some concerted effort it's made as

1095
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,480
tempting as it may be

1096
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,040
that you do appreciate the heterogeneity

1097
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,520
of among different implementations

1098
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,880
but the truth is that sometimes the

1099
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
developer circulates you know some some

1100
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
people work for organization now work in

1101
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,960
ic and so on so

1102
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,079
it's not exactly strict but i hope if a

1103
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,400
guy comes to a new code base that

1104
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,280
he doesn't doesn't use the code he he

1105
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,880
you know had it in the previous job

1106
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,920
which is obvious again so yeah i think

1107
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,839
we are quite strict all organizations i

1108
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,640
i assume we are quite strict in that

1109
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,320
yeah it's it's almost like an honor

1110
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,119
thing

1111
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,359
uh where you you don't want to look at

1112
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,280
the other person's code you want to look

1113
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,440
at the specification you want to look at

1114
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,880
the standards and do your own

1115
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,520
implementation and this is also where

1116
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,000
the diversity comes from you know

1117
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,440
everybody was concerned about the

1118
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,760
monoculture of certain software

1119
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,160
implementations uh it's it's actually

1120
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,920
one of the reasons that we started with

1121
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,119
nsd because at the time in the 90s you

1122
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,839
really only had buying aid

1123
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,240
so so the developers are really strict

1124
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,280
about making a brand new implementation

1125
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,920
a completely different

1126
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,520
architecture

1127
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,000
and and doing it from the ground up with

1128
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,079
their own ideas and their own choices

1129
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,480
but what uh all of the developers of all

1130
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,440
of our our respective organizations do

1131
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,760
is discuss for example uh

1132
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,319
behavioral differences like hey if i

1133
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,560
send this query to your resolver i get

1134
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,240
this reply or in this specific

1135
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,040
circumstance i get that behavior how

1136
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,079
does that work in the other

1137
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,720
implementations why did you decide on

1138
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,680
that

1139
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,599
why do you think that is better or this

1140
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,400
is better

1141
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,119
so you you do discuss behavior but you

1142
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,520
never look at code maybe one more thing

1143
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,440
to add you know

1144
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,280
especially when i spoke about birth you

1145
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,119
know can you imagine this situation that

1146
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,960
we would introduce some bug

1147
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,720
in this code you know they

1148
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,680
as i said most of the ixps very large

1149
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,920
cdn's use that software and i'm sure

1150
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,400
this this call is rooted through some

1151
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,880
rooting decision of birth so

1152
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,040
and that's also a reason and i will i

1153
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,200
will repeat what jeff has said that we

1154
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,119
are very slow with versions because we

1155
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,359
have to be super sure that this software

1156
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,200
has no backs and

1157
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,119
before we release it and if we would

1158
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,440
introduce any single bug or any we would

1159
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,920
share some bug with others that really

1160
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,680
might be catastrophic for the internet

1161
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,280
you know just try to imagine that all

1162
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,119
the exchange points will

1163
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,599
you know fall at one point you know and

1164
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,920
that that is possible if if we would

1165
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,319
make a buck in in birth that that would

1166
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,359
make it

1167
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,920
possible to crash it remotely so so we

1168
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,359
have to be very responsible with the

1169
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,480
code and everything is very carefully uh

1170
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,160
checked of course

1171
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,240
thank you andrew jeff let me ask you one

1172
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,200
question that i'm going to ask a

1173
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,319
question of the group and i think we'll

1174
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,160
wrap up for the q a jeff your

1175
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,640
organization was um was was led by

1176
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,560
someone we all i think know and love

1177
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,319
paul bixie and

1178
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,599
effectively i think he's in your role

1179
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,640
for a while

1180
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,680
um

1181
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,920
what what's sort of the what's the

1182
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,720
difference or what changes when he's a

1183
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,520
very outspoken uh person he's very well

1184
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,920
known he's had uh influence over the

1185
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,760
industry and as well as i see all the

1186
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,440
terms or the

1187
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,800
his term there

1188
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,839
um what what's what changes happen and

1189
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,119
change your leadership and organization

1190
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,240
like that does does much change

1191
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,760
well

1192
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,960
how would you say things are different

1193
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,920
between his tenure there and yours now

1194
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,280
um i have a huge amount of respect for

1195
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,480
paul he and i communicate

1196
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,280
frequently um we used to live near each

1197
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,640
other in california i moved to new

1198
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
hampshire a couple of years ago

1199
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,400
we tend to sit next to each other in the

1200
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,319
various rsac meetings because he

1201
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,640
represents cogent and i represent

1202
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,400
isc so

1203
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
what didn't happen though is paul and i

1204
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,319
didn't overlap

1205
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,560
paul had handed over

1206
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,200
control of isc to a series of interim

1207
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,240
presidents that kind of didn't work out

1208
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,079
so literally i had just started

1209
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,400
consulting when he was just on the board

1210
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,000
of directors without

1211
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
an operational role and then left with

1212
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,200
farsight

1213
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,280
so

1214
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,839
the change wasn't so much from heed to

1215
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,000
eye as

1216
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,079
he handed it off to a series of interim

1217
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,200
people so um

1218
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,280
paul is a visionary

1219
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,480
and the industry we are all in does not

1220
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,880
function well without visionaries

1221
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,040
um

1222
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,520
i am an operational guy

1223
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,520
but you know i started as a programmer

1224
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,079
long long ago and just recognized you

1225
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,680
people need to be organized and have

1226
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,359
people make payroll for you so i'm going

1227
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,280
to take care of you all and do that and

1228
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,880
have had a series of roles where that

1229
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,599
worked really well i worked at uunet we

1230
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,280
had a visionary it was rick adams i

1231
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,280
didn't need to be one but i turned out

1232
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,800
to be really good at

1233
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,560
organizing people to show up do the

1234
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,119
installations on time order the correct

1235
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,640
equipment have it configured and get

1236
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,599
people to give us money so i showed up

1237
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,319
to isc and

1238
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,800
as i said it was

1239
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,680
it was positioned to me as a turnaround

1240
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,400
because

1241
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,119
with the visionary gone all you had was

1242
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,640
operations that were not

1243
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,839
running in an optimal way

1244
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,200
so you know bringing decades of love for

1245
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,440
open source and i've literally been

1246
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,359
involved directly on the internet since

1247
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:58,480
1983 when i was operating x-25 um

1248
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,960
pads in santa barbara i mean

1249
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,920
i go way back i come by this honestly

1250
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,480
but i am a um i'm a businessman and an

1251
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,000
operations person where paul was a

1252
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,599
visionary and so you end up with

1253
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,599
something different i would like to

1254
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,359
think i've given the people who are

1255
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,760
running the technical components of the

1256
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,079
company enough leeway that isc is still

1257
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,480
a meaningful interesting organization

1258
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,119
but my focus has been on the making sure

1259
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,640
everybody gets paid

1260
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,760
paid well

1261
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,079
the health insurance bills get paid

1262
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,680
we get to show up for conferences and

1263
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,000
all the money works we can afford to

1264
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,079
apparently take people out who are

1265
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,760
important and spend time with them and

1266
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,720
so i think the big difference is um

1267
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,040
i would hope i wasn't the the john

1268
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,040
scully to steve jobs i would hope rather

1269
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,560
i'm i'm i'm being an adequate caretaker

1270
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,000
but i'm extremely concerned about

1271
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,720
losing the soul of the company because

1272
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,000
we're trying to make it run as a

1273
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,119
business i think the organization still

1274
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,079
is extremely empowered by the engineers

1275
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,599
we have

1276
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,720
we try really hard to have very

1277
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,599
um employee empowering stuff this is

1278
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,079
going to start sounding like hr but i am

1279
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,319
very proud that every american working

1280
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,480
for me has up to three months of paid

1281
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,640
family leave they have up to three

1282
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,960
months of paid um

1283
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,200
sick time they start with a month of

1284
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,800
paid vacation

1285
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,359
we are we are not that american

1286
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,079
organization we are not

1287
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,960
embarrassed to ship late we don't mind

1288
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,520
doing the right thing

1289
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,079
ever nobody ever gets told this is the

1290
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,240
biggest business decision please put

1291
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,240
your ethics in a box

1292
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,599
ever and and i'm proud of that so

1293
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,359
if i can get off my soapbox i hope

1294
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,440
that's the question you're asking

1295
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,520
i hope that people do approach you at

1296
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,560
the conference and have these

1297
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,839
discussions with you a little more

1298
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,640
detailed and possible

1299
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,560
i'll buy we had a great year maybe not

1300
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,720
next year but this year i'm still buying

1301
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,079
that's insurance to the hallway track

1302
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,240
this year

1303
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,079
let me pose one final question to all of

1304
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,839
you you can all sort of answer your own

1305
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:12,960
way i

1306
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,560
there's there's other organizations like

1307
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,800
yours who unfortunately we um just

1308
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,839
didn't have space or have the

1309
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,839
opportunity to talk to today um but

1310
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,440
there's not that many of them that do

1311
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
what you do there's relatively few who

1312
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,880
you know are writing these well-known

1313
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,800
dns resolvers you know it's four or five

1314
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,839
maybe um the open source routing

1315
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,720
software dhcp software you know the rpki

1316
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,160
stuff we need some more implementations

1317
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,440
of that especially what krill does right

1318
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,880
what is it

1319
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,640
what would you tell people or how would

1320
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,920
you advise people if they if they're an

1321
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,079
irr for instance or some registry

1322
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,920
perhaps maybe is a good organization to

1323
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,359
get involved in this sort of stuff how

1324
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:50,720
do you if people want to get involved

1325
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,480
and do what you do

1326
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,839
what advice would you have for them how

1327
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,520
would they start what

1328
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,720
what were some error what was some

1329
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,400
things they need to look at to consider

1330
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,240
doing what you do so i'll start with you

1331
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,280
alex and then audrey then jeff

1332
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,079
uh

1333
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,680
i would say

1334
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,359
but that's also because i'm a product

1335
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,839
guy focus on the product make it

1336
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,920
really really great i mean

1337
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,800
if i look at what we did with uh krillin

1338
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,599
routine in the rpi space

1339
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,480
to a large degree it is built on the

1340
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,040
legacy and the reputation of the helmet

1341
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,920
labs and what nsd and unbound have

1342
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,319
brought to the organization so the fact

1343
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,599
that we made

1344
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,000
a brand new package in a brand new

1345
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,200
programming language

1346
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,920
with no track record

1347
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,880
at all

1348
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,680
is largely thanks to

1349
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,800
the legacy of vanilla labs the people go

1350
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,880
like okay so

1351
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,640
they make it

1352
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,680
and

1353
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,920
that made a huge difference

1354
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,319
and the point i'm trying to make is that

1355
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,800
that reputation for quality dedication

1356
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,520
is absolutely paramount

1357
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,480
because

1358
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,319
at the end of the day the reason that we

1359
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,160
don't need a marketing department is

1360
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,240
because all of our products speak for

1361
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,119
themselves uh if you try them out you

1362
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,440
read the documentation you install it

1363
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,160
you use it you go like hey this actually

1364
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,960
works really well uh this is really good

1365
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,599
stuff and then people tell their their

1366
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,599
peers about it and and all of a sudden

1367
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,440
people start giving a presentation about

1368
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,599
it and it just works

1369
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,880
by itself

1370
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,680
so focusing on on making something

1371
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,400
that's absolutely awesome

1372
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,960
uh and and pouring your heart and soul

1373
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,480
into that

1374
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,040
is the key and just like jeff said we

1375
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,440
don't care if we ship late

1376
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,720
we stray stay true to our values and

1377
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,280
that ultimately that quality that floats

1378
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,480
to the top

1379
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,359
and

1380
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:54,480
it also

1381
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,520
uh offers us the the trust in other

1382
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,200
areas so there are now there's

1383
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,599
organizations approaching us saying okay

1384
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,079
we've seen what you've done done in dns

1385
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,400
you've seen what you've done with rpki

1386
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,160
tooling um

1387
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,839
we're facing these particular problems

1388
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,800
um

1389
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,880
do you want to collaborate or do you

1390
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,119
want to

1391
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,680
work on a new project or would you feel

1392
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,839
like venturing into a new area and that

1393
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,359
is all because of a relentless focus on

1394
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,680
on quality software

1395
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,640
you know if i add to that i think before

1396
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,160
you start the project think what you

1397
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,640
want to achieve you know just just doing

1398
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,720
another implementation that's not so

1399
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,960
helpful you know we always had some

1400
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,040
ultimate goal like when we started birth

1401
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,720
we just said we will have a demon that

1402
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,559
will have the most flexible filtering in

1403
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,520
the world

1404
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,760
and that would be a addition you know

1405
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,280
and that worked that worked very well

1406
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,200
and and

1407
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,040
the language is absolutely exotic

1408
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,960
strange you need to really learn to be

1409
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,200
able to to run the demon but

1410
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,599
but now it's used um by the companies

1411
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,000
that that uh you know found that this is

1412
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,280
valuable and

1413
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,599
and we became kind of well known in that

1414
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,119
industry the same with with the

1415
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,440
resolvers or authoritative dns we just

1416
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,359
said we will be the fastest in the world

1417
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,200
i i'm not saying we achieved it because

1418
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,040
we might have some discussion among us

1419
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,079
about it

1420
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,200
but but the truth true fact is that once

1421
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,480
we uh

1422
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,640
at least announced that you know others

1423
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,760
implementations accelerated amazingly so

1424
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,160
so we we we bring something new to the

1425
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,319
industry so i think come with something

1426
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,240
innovative something that uh you will

1427
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,000
have quickly some funk ups and people

1428
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,920
that will use it just because of that

1429
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,960
feature

1430
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,839
uh and you know make yourself a little

1431
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,440
bit different from the others of course

1432
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,040
you know so

1433
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,839
and prepare for for for quite poor years

1434
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,119
at the beginning of course you know

1435
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,200
i think jeff's story is fascinating and

1436
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,160
uh

1437
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,160
it's probably not easy to you know to go

1438
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,160
from a subsidized organization to an

1439
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,319
organization that that makes profits so

1440
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,079
prepare for such a painful path as well

1441
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,599
and jeffery advice for people who want

1442
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,720
to

1443
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,880
operate as an organization or do the

1444
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,720
kinds of things that you do

1445
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,559
i really hate speaking on this because

1446
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,400
my experience

1447
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,880
has been so depressing

1448
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,839
trying to encourage

1449
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,520
smaller open source products to get here

1450
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,079
i was lucky to stand on the shoulder of

1451
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,119
a giant paul vixie who after almost two

1452
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,839
decades decided to leave right when a

1453
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:34,720
mutual friend who trusted me said why

1454
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,559
don't you take a look at this

1455
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,559
and so

1456
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:39,839
you know

1457
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,240
that that doesn't happen twice that was

1458
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,800
just really lucky but since then what's

1459
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,200
been awful to me is the number of

1460
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,839
organizations we have spotted and said

1461
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,720
oh look it's a little open source

1462
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,760
organization or a long-running one that

1463
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,680
is little in terms of figuring out how

1464
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,440
to pay itself

1465
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,480
come

1466
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
come work with us and let us figure out

1467
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,200
a very non-threatening way we can help

1468
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,240
you

1469
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,800
do something because the problem is when

1470
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,720
you have the idea and you put the open

1471
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,520
source thing out there and it grows

1472
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,079
nobody needs a support contract because

1473
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,800
it's just this little thing growing so

1474
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
by the time it gets to the point of it

1475
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,359
needs an open source contract you the

1476
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,480
team of developers are very proprietary

1477
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,400
and i won't name who this happened to

1478
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,839
but i will after the third beer in

1479
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:30,880
person

1480
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,960
there was a group of guys who are so

1481
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,119
vital to the internet

1482
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,280
had an error that was so public and

1483
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,240
awful

1484
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,400
and we literally sat down with the one

1485
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,760
of them willing to come out of the

1486
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,319
woodwork and sit with us and said

1487
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,440
we feel so bad we can't figure out what

1488
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,640
to do

1489
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,040
here is a check for three million

1490
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,079
dollars with no strings attached

1491
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,400
god bless you and get better

1492
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,960
can we talk in a month or two about how

1493
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,280
maybe because this is a sign of good

1494
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,240
faith we can talk again and they said

1495
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,319
let me make a call and we sat there

1496
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,000
going well this is probably a good start

1497
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,440
how can we repeat this and they went

1498
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,520
back and got on the phone and they came

1499
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,839
back with a handful of torn up check and

1500
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,880
threw on the table and said

1501
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,440
so

1502
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,680
true story and you know the you know who

1503
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,280
i'm talking about and like i said it's

1504
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,880
got to be three beers so i can deny it

1505
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,839
in court

1506
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,000
so

1507
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,079
i don't know how to do this

1508
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,240
we're actively trying and i have a whole

1509
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,720
list of failures i can share but

1510
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,820
i don't have a success yet um

1511
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,200
[Laughter]

1512
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,359
anyway that's that's what i'd say this

1513
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,520
is this is unfortunately really hard if

1514
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,280
anybody has a clever idea i'm dumb

1515
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,119
enough to try anything but the problem

1516
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,720
is the need for the commercial part

1517
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,960
comes long after the popular success and

1518
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,040
the disconnection of those two things

1519
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,880
seems to be a real hard problem to solve

1520
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,119
did that make sense because it it's true

1521
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,920
i just may not have explained it well

1522
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,680
we're all not in your head so i it made

1523
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,720
sense at least here in this recording

1524
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,079
okay so we'll see what kind of questions

1525
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,280
we get live thank you all very much for

1526
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,960
for your time and your

1527
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,440
uh your candidates as well and uh your

1528
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,440
your viewpoints and perspective on what

1529
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,040
it takes to do what you do and how you

1530
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,240
do it and

1531
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,880
um and what is actually do uh with that

1532
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,240
there will be a q a hopefully a little

1533
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,479
bit of time

1534
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,480
thanks for that we do have

1535
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,640
quite a few questions uh on the online

1536
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,319
chat um

1537
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,720
any questions in the room anybody if you

1538
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,440
have a question feel free to walk up to

1539
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,160
the

1540
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,720
microphone

1541
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,160
so

1542
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,760
not seeing any questions in the room

1543
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,920
let's start with the online

1544
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,559
we have jeff here on stage

1545
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,280
john alex and andre are

1546
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,520
with us remotely

1547
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,839
so first question uh this is from

1548
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,200
matthew p tack

1549
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,520
jeff your presentation makes the future

1550
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,280
of software projects at ist isc sound

1551
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,520
relatively fragile should service

1552
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,680
providers be concerned or wary of the

1553
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,319
next cycle of knee pads and cuts putting

1554
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,400
in another core piece of software like

1555
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,280
ise dhcp or bind on the chopping block

1556
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,119
or would isc be willing to transfer the

1557
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,880
code base to a commercial entity to keep

1558
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,960
it alive for the rest of the service

1559
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,520
provider community even if ise can't

1560
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,880
continue to develop it going forward

1561
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,920
um

1562
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,680
before i answer i'd like to thank the av

1563
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,280
guys for beeping

1564
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,760
the f-bomb that's i appreciate it um

1565
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,960
that is a

1566
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,880
the question kind of shocks me that's

1567
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,799
really not the takeaway i would have

1568
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,079
expected

1569
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,000
this was a case where

1570
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,359
um an open source organization was

1571
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,960
failing to succeed at a business

1572
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,079
and yet being given big checks because

1573
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,240
we have really deep pockets

1574
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,359
so

1575
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,000
that's almost a decade ago we are in a

1576
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,240
really strong position now

1577
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,200
so i suspect we're going to be around

1578
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,280
for i've signed on for another 10 years

1579
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,520
because they asked me to i expect to be

1580
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,040
in a very strong position for at least

1581
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,760
that long i think that the message is

1582
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,440
not that open source needs to become

1583
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,920
commercial or something but just

1584
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,839
organizations like the ones you all

1585
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,280
belong to

1586
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,599
use a lot of open source and the big

1587
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,079
number is one out of ten thousand paying

1588
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,040
for it

1589
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,079
because you can't get an you know an roi

1590
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,079
that says paying for

1591
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,160
either uh unbound or not or bind or any

1592
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,000
of the other products you use it doesn't

1593
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,880
have a direct roi but if you know if

1594
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,720
these become unsupported products and

1595
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,960
fail that's that's a problem

1596
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,640
and i think these three organizations

1597
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,480
are relatively strong although we still

1598
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,119
need your help but

1599
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,640
there are lots of things out there i

1600
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,720
can't believe ntp still exists i mean

1601
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,440
they're they're there are things that

1602
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,280
need to be funded

1603
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,160
better

1604
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,079
and everybody in this room has a lot of

1605
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,760
pull in their organization it would be

1606
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,280
interesting to start a discussion with

1607
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,640
people who can write purchase orders and

1608
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,079
say

1609
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,160
open source is a vital part of us doing

1610
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,480
business why aren't we supporting it

1611
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,000
thank you for that

1612
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,920
okay um next question comes online from

1613
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,520
patrick gilmore

1614
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,000
when you ask organizations to support

1615
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,480
you have they ever offered to loan you a

1616
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,119
developer for six months or a year

1617
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,280
instead of money and if they did would

1618
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,599
you take the offer

1619
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:46,960
and this is a question for all the

1620
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,960
panelists

1621
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,160
who wants to go first

1622
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,079
somebody else take it untucked

1623
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,000
yeah i'll go first

1624
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that is i've never had that question as

1625
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,599
absolutely yes

1626
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,839
in fact i had a meeting last friday

1627
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,760
with an open source developer who

1628
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,599
maintains a project

1629
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,520
in his spare time

1630
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,559
who is employed by a big organization

1631
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,319
and

1632
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,160
i immediately thought of that example

1633
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,200
like if

1634
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,919
david london

1635
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,319
do you want me to try to fill in um yeah

1636
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,160
you can go ahead oh we're back we're

1637
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,920
back excellent

1638
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,359
all right um

1639
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,319
alexander i'm not sure exactly where we

1640
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,160
accidentally cut you off but you were in

1641
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,480
mid answer i believe

1642
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,680
yeah

1643
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,440
oh yeah but the short answer is

1644
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,000
basically uh nobody's ever offered that

1645
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,400
and i would absolutely consider that if

1646
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,319
it's somebody with the right profile

1647
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,160
um

1648
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,400
and who is currently employed by a big

1649
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,559
company and they do like an open source

1650
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:55,520
project

1651
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,079
in their spare time uh and they can do

1652
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,440
that full time and then they'll not labs

1653
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,599
for a year and work together with our

1654
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,599
team that that be absolutely fantastic

1655
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:08,160
all right thank you um

1656
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,520
andre would you like to answer

1657
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,000
so i'm not sure if if my answer was was

1658
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,400
heard so i hope i'm not confused but

1659
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,319
just to this point you know that we

1660
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,880
provided some developers to ac in the

1661
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,640
long time ago when the situation was

1662
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,799
probably not as shiny as jeff is

1663
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,720
presenting today so

1664
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,319
we never took some developers from

1665
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:29,920
outside but that's an interesting idea

1666
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,559
and of course you know i would like to

1667
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,640
explore every possible path to improve

1668
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,200
my software so sure why not but never

1669
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,880
happened to us but on the other hand we

1670
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
provided some some developers in the

1671
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,599
past to the others okay

1672
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,440
and jeff

1673
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,960
we've never been offered it either it's

1674
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,839
a it it's a fascinating idea um

1675
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:51,280
if you know if it was for two weeks it

1676
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,920
doesn't help because the the ramp time

1677
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,440
is pretty considerable but getting a

1678
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,960
developer for a year that's that's a

1679
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,040
fascinating idea

1680
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,000
all right

1681
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,400
well thank you um

1682
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,040
next question in the

1683
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,079
online queue seeing no in the room

1684
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,119
this question is from blake willis

1685
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,520
the energy behind foss in meetings like

1686
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,680
nanog and ripe is fantastic to see and

1687
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,599
it's growing do you think there's enough

1688
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:20,559
momentum here to start an annual

1689
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,799
non-large corporation open source

1690
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,880
networking conference by the way i've

1691
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,720
been to ons a few times and it's not

1692
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,040
that

1693
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,400
who wants to

1694
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,880
do we lose the zoom again

1695
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,680
there we go maybe not great thanks okay

1696
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,359
um okay okay um feel free to start

1697
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,280
yeah so the uh the only conference i

1698
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,920
know of is foster in uh which is held

1699
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,240
annually in belgium which is exactly

1700
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,240
that it focuses on open source

1701
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,839
development with all kinds of open

1702
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:53,119
source

1703
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,119
organizations uh

1704
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,640
and

1705
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,240
part-time developers who come together

1706
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,319
at a giant conference and discuss these

1707
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,119
things

1708
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,799
so foster

1709
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,720
okay

1710
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,799
anybody any other other panelists like

1711
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:08,720
to

1712
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,799
add any more

1713
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:13,520
color to that

1714
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,240
right then

1715
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,240
did i oh you're right i did miss tony's

1716
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,839
question apologies

1717
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,079
for the panel what metrics should an

1718
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,559
employ enterprise look for

1719
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,039
about the oss developers to help that

1720
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,559
enterprise assess risks

1721
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,839
who wants to go first

1722
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,870
which risks

1723
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:45,680
[Music]

1724
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,799
i'm gonna

1725
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,240
i'm not sure if i got a question

1726
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,079
correctly but you know if i if i would

1727
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:51,599
be a large enterprise and i would use

1728
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,680
some open source product i would like to

1729
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,839
be sure that this product continues that

1730
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,960
it's well supported and that i have some

1731
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,960
kind of agreement that you know sla

1732
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,720
agreement whatever agreement that helps

1733
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,799
me with that because if i'm a large

1734
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,720
enterprise i depend on that then it's of

1735
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,880
course natural that i would somehow

1736
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,960
secure this uh you know mitigate this

1737
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,400
race so support the developers uh make a

1738
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,880
contract with them and try to understand

1739
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,039
the way their business is to if their

1740
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,799
business is sustainable and and help

1741
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:24,000
them so that would be my my position as

1742
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,400
a large enterprise which i'm not

1743
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,200
yeah

1744
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,000
yeah when i think of it uh unbanned has

1745
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,200
been audited in 2019

1746
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,720
and

1747
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,160
it was only because he came on our path

1748
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,119
that that one organization was willing

1749
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,880
to fund it another organization was

1750
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,799
willing to do the audit

1751
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:47,119
a couple of bugs and improvements came

1752
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,880
out of it but

1753
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,039
uh in all of the history i've never

1754
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,160
heard that be a requirement from an

1755
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,839
enterprise

1756
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:58,480
or be like a stumbling block for people

1757
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,720
wanting to choose unbanned

1758
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,119
like we were you be negotiations or

1759
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,119
people would ask me you know that does

1760
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,119
amount have this certification or that

1761
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,680
kind of audit before i would consider

1762
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,119
using it you've never had those

1763
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:12,720
questions usually it's people who've

1764
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,319
been running the software for a long

1765
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,920
time and then contact us with uh with a

1766
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,240
problem or implementation thing

1767
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,400
uh or maybe like a security thing or a

1768
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,400
request for a support contract to sort

1769
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,960
of formalize the thing the only other

1770
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,799
thing that comes to mind is that

1771
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,760
larger organizations tend to build

1772
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,720
functionality themselves to port back

1773
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,880
into inbound

1774
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,680
to use that as an example and as the

1775
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,520
software sort of grows and develop they

1776
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:47,039
have to keep patching this back into the

1777
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,599
core implementation into the main branch

1778
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,680
and at a certain moment they become so

1779
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,240
labor intensive and so problematic that

1780
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,240
they contacted us and they just said you

1781
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,319
know can we just

1782
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,559
fund the development of this particular

1783
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,599
feature into the main branch of

1784
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,920
the software and then you maintain it

1785
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,240
from there on out because that actually

1786
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,079
saves us

1787
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,760
a lot of time and money

1788
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,799
um

1789
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,079
and

1790
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,359
that's also the first time that i

1791
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:16,880
actually thought of it like that the

1792
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,520
company actively contacted us

1793
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,960
to sort of propose that path forward

1794
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,680
and

1795
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,440
i'm actually curious whether this

1796
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,319
happens more how how much the software

1797
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,480
that we develop is customized and

1798
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,280
there's like custom forks hanging around

1799
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,160
that

1800
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,240
that need to need maintenance going

1801
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,558
forward

1802
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,160
yeah just to add to what the other two

1803
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,440
said i think that the the risk

1804
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,280
mitigation as i understand it is if you

1805
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,039
get a contract with any of our

1806
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,680
organizations you get an sla at some

1807
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,799
level of

1808
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,880
how soon somebody will get back to you

1809
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,039
it can be as much as you know 15 minutes

1810
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,119
around the clock whether your uh

1811
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,000
conversations are immediate um and then

1812
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,880
you also get the advanced notice um the

1813
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,960
fix when there's a cve

1814
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,440
and you know that pretty much puts you

1815
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,680
in a position where

1816
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,280
you have a leg to stand on when you say

1817
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,880
that we're supported by this product we

1818
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,160
have a commercial

1819
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,000
service level agreement we have coverage

1820
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,839
we get advanced notice of bug fixes

1821
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:18,480
um

1822
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,920
that should make anybody feel better

1823
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,680
about it they tend to be tremendously

1824
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,680
less expensive than the commercial

1825
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,200
solutions as well

1826
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,960
there's sort of a moral imperative

1827
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,280
because people are using it and they're

1828
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,480
not paying for it

1829
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,880
i have a heart

1830
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,760
yeah

1831
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,559
if if i think you know the the krillin

1832
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,960
routine or the two software packages

1833
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,280
actually at metrics on uh there's more

1834
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,440
than two thousand organizations that use

1835
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,079
trill there are 1600 organizations that

1836
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,160
use our alternator if all of them would

1837
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,799
pay like 20 bucks a month

1838
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,640
we would not be having this discussion

1839
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,000
at all

1840
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,839
but what i said in my talk earlier the

1841
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,400
fact that our entire organization

1842
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,599
is funded by 50 organizations and the

1843
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,760
prospect you know or the risk that i

1844
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,799
could lose like five or eight of them

1845
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,880
and that would have a direct impact on

1846
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,200
our reserves and how many developers i

1847
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,440
get to have in the payroll uh

1848
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,359
that to me is the most concerning thing

1849
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:20,880
so yeah like jeff said have a heart

1850
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,280
great um that is the last question in

1851
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,880
the queue um

1852
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,880
so thank you all for your time and for

1853
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,400
an excellent panel thank you very much

1854
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,120
thanks thank you

1855
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,850
