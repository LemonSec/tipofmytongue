[Music]

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,759
wasn't that a fantastic keynote

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,599
radio came to the university of north

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,120
carolina school of computer science

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,759
several years ago and i was so excited

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,560
to hear her speak i definitely fangirled

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
a little bit

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,560
in that speech she said that her version

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,720
of the osi reference model has a few

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,760
changes not to worry the physical data

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,920
link network and transport layers are

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,880
all intact but anything above layer 5

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,280
has been relabeled as boring

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,800
let's hope i venture no higher than

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,840
layer 4 today unless i do the wrong

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,719
thing

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,719
you got it

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,360
my name is adair thackson and i am a

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
network engineer's worst enemy a

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,200
security engineer who used to have a

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,719
ccna

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,800
this talk is pre-recorded but i've asked

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
one of my co-workers to hang out and

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,719
chat and tag team questions and answers

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,480
with me during the anage itself

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,359
now

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,199
i wanted to give you guys a bit of a

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,640
fair warning

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,799
in this presentation i'm going to be

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
using the f word

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,040
if you have small children or sensitive

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,840
years i just want you to be aware of

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,680
that of course this is nanox so the f

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,840
word in question is

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,080
firewall

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
i just didn't want to scare anybody when

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,640
i said that

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,400
this will not be the last sesame street

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
preacher you see

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,280
you're welcome

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,600
i work for internet2 which is probably

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
one of the fastest networks that some of

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
you have never heard of

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,079
when i explain internet2 to

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,320
non-networked people i use the illusion

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,040
of a toll highway for municipalities

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,880
researchers and students across the

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,000
country

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
we connect 46 regional and state

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
education networks

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,920
59 government agencies and more than 300

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
universities

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
through our state and regional education

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
networks more than 65 000 k-12 schools

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,840
are connected to internet too

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,680
additionally we are working with the

57
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
minority serving cyber infrastructure

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,880
consortium on a three million dollar nsf

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,560
grant to address the cyber

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,120
infrastructure needs of more than 700

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
historically black colleges and

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,879
universities and tribal colleges and

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,239
universities

64
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,400
this is our network backbone map

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
i did take this snapshot at 11 45 am on

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,360
a school day because i wanted to try to

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,440
make it look good

68
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
we appear in all the usual places within

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,239
the united states and 2020 really made

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,400
us take a look at our pairings with home

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
isps

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
science and scientists don't stop

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
researching and applying for grants just

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,480
because they're working from home

75
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,160
we need to make some adjustments to

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,879
allow better connectivity with home isps

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,560
for those people while they're working

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,080
at home

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,040
we also interconnect with more than 65

80
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,400
networks globally reaching 100 countries

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,040
additionally we increasingly provide the

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,760
software and tools that enable users and

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,680
operators to interact with commercial

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,640
cloud

85
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,200
big science projects and other at-scale

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,599
or large-scale collaborations

87
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,840
i said new network so let's get into

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,959
that

89
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,120
we began collecting user requirements

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,959
for our next generation infrastructure

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,440
network in 2016.

92
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,599
after multiple information gathering

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,400
sessions with our community the rfp was

94
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
issued later that year and a vendor was

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
chosen in fall of 2020. our next

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
generation network includes new features

97
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,879
primarily driven by software automation

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,440
and systems virtualization to allow the

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
infrastructure to be more readily

100
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,360
integrated into the broader enterprise

101
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
campus regional and cloud environment

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,599
around us

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,959
planning for the secure management

104
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,560
network on the other hand

105
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,159
began in 2017 but was paused because

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,560
well i wasn't there at the time

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
but

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,519
when that mean old kid blew up our

109
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,280
beautiful death star it kind of set us

110
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,879
back

111
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,280
we picked it up back up in earnest in

112
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,519
2018 with some new engineers and have

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,439
been working on it in conjunction with

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,879
the next generation infrastructure

115
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,159
network

116
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,959
anyway this is an analog of course so i

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,640
i said i have to talk about the network

118
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
maps and the big numbers before i get

119
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
into the really interesting stuff which

120
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,440
is of course the security stuff

121
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,079
as part of our fiber network upgrade we

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
replace the underlying fiber releases in

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,320
about 80 percent of our footprint which

124
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,199
means we are now capable of 800 gig plus

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,400
wavelengths and 32 terabits per second

126
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,320
capacity per link

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
the packet network upgrade means we now

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,840
have at least 24 400 gig ports and 12

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,880
100 gig ports in every node and our

130
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
intra node capacity is now a minimum of

131
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,919
2 by 400 gig

132
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,240
almost all of our 3-way sites have an

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,600
exit capacity of 2.4 terabits per second

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,560
minimum

135
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,520
and some have an exit capacity of 3.2

136
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,360
terabits per second we're going to take

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,919
a look back at 2010 which was when we

138
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,720
installed our previous network

139
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,680
in 2010 our backbone link capacity was

140
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,560
250 gigabits per second total

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
and our upgraded next generation network

142
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,160
now

143
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
is capable of 127

144
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,320
700 gigabits per second

145
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,320
in 2010 our total device capacity was

146
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,919
453 gigabits per second

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,919
and our new upgraded total device

148
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,720
capacity is 810 000 gigabits per second

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,039
over the same time period our total

150
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,160
annual traffic has increased from 104

151
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,080
petabytes in 2010 to 2800

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,880
petabytes in 2021.

153
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,479
it's a nice network we built here it

154
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,320
sure would be a shame if something were

155
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,840
to happen to it

156
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
previous network was running on the

157
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,479
juniper mx platform and we consists we

158
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,800
subsisted on a diet of access control

159
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
lists and control plane policing via

160
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
firewall filters

161
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
we use the counters to track hits via

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,400
snmp

163
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,479
we had a few thresholds that we had

164
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,600
chosen

165
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
mainly with a dartboard

166
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,120
and some of them had been removed over

167
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,240
the years when they proved prohibitive

168
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
in addition to stateful filtering we

169
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
also wanted to filter outbound traffic

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,000
which was something that we were not

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,160
already doing

172
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,319
in the new next generation network

173
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,080
control plan policing is done with

174
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,360
cisco's lpts local packet transport

175
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,440
services functionality

176
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,880
which is supposed to act like an

177
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,720
intrusion prevention system within your

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,080
router

179
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,000
secure management network is a separate

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,319
layer of protection on top of that

181
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,080
our existing management network was

182
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
really nothing groundbreaking older

183
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,400
cisco devices configured for reverse

184
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
telnet with some terminal servers

185
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
patched in

186
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,360
the sort of thing that you would really

187
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
hope you could find documentation for

188
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,080
when they woke you up at 2am basically

189
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
given the chance to fix something you'd

190
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
want to make it more friendly in a

191
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
network emergency given the opportunity

192
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
to rethink this we took it

193
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,039
the first thing we had to look at was

194
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,880
what should go through the secure

195
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,919
management network and what shouldn't

196
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,160
obviously secure shell should go through

197
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,759
the secure path

198
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,680
we have performance monitoring servers

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
at each location we can manage them via

200
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,160
their out-of-band idrac ports that

201
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,560
should go via the secure path too

202
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
and anything else read write like we use

203
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
a lot of net conf that should go via the

204
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
secure path as well

205
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,160
low impact stuff like snmp is probably

206
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,520
fine

207
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,120
if you step back though in the case of

208
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,759
an emergency the goal is to restore

209
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,319
network access so anything that's

210
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,400
required to achieve that goal should go

211
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,240
out of band over the secure management

212
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
network

213
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,240
things that should go in-band instead

214
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,840
are bandwidth intensive things like

215
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,240
software upgrades and netflow

216
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,160
additionally we've identified a bug that

217
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,000
we have fought with our vendor

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,280
on because rpki route origin validation

219
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,039
can only happen via an m-band loopback

220
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,120
we hope to have that result soon

221
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,039
lest you thought any bit of this would

222
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,319
be easy our homegrown tools assumed only

223
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,879
one primary management ip address and

224
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,360
they had to be redesigned to account for

225
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,680
the primary out-of-band path as well as

226
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,160
the back-up inband path in case the

227
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,479
secure management goes down we have to

228
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,680
have contingencies for our contingencies

229
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,080
the secure management network has three

230
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,880
essential parts the dedicated router

231
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,519
firewall and terminal server and we have

232
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,958
those across three different site types

233
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,399
the biggest change for us is the

234
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,320
hardware firewall

235
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,000
you may have noticed that we're proud of

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,920
the speed of our new network in

237
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
firewalls

238
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,880
well

239
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,440
nano is held at austin this year right

240
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
you don't bring a toyota corolla to the

241
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,360
formula one race at circuit of the

242
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,320
americas do you

243
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,360
wait

244
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,959
i'm getting

245
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,760
someone is telling me in chat right now

246
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,200
that they in fact have brought their

247
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
toyota corolla to attracting at circuit

248
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,600
of the americas

249
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,160
congratulations very good job

250
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,839
now we don't have a lot of experience

251
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,360
having firewalls in our production

252
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
network and it's been a bit of a sea

253
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,200
change i'll touch on that later given

254
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,360
the chance to greenfield a new secure

255
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
management network we mapped out three

256
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,880
different site types

257
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
we have an entry exit site a standard

258
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,519
site and a remote site they're all

259
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,519
slightly different so i'll explain how

260
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,279
and why you'll notice that each

261
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,360
different site type has a dedicated

262
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,760
router for the secure management network

263
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
the router has three different vers

264
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
one for optical management

265
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,720
one for a performance monitoring server

266
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,959
management and one that serves as the

267
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,880
primary path for managing the network

268
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,800
and any other devices required for the

269
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,160
network to function

270
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,480
such as our pdus traffic between the

271
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,880
verbs has to go through the big firewall

272
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,240
which in this case is a juniper srx1500

273
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
and that is where the firewall rules

274
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,519
live

275
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,320
now

276
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,959
this is an entry exit site for us which

277
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,200
is why we have the big firewall here and

278
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,040
a slightly more complex network topology

279
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,519
first up we have the 100 megabits per

280
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,519
second wayside channel optical service

281
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
channel over the optical network

282
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,720
of course 100 megabits per second isn't

283
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,560
a whole whole lot

284
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,800
and you know what security people tend

285
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
to be a little bit of an anxious bunch

286
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,079
so we couldn't rely solely on that

287
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,399
in comes the layer 3 backbone over the

288
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,560
new next generation network and the

289
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,640
layer 2 overlay over that which goes

290
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,560
between the secure management network

291
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,240
routers

292
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,640
the big firewall has ipsec tunnels to

293
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,959
the we firewalls at some of the other

294
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,079
sites

295
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,720
and finally as displayed in purple at

296
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
most of our secure management network

297
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,560
sites we have some 10 gig optical

298
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,399
circuits for good measure

299
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,279
again this is an entry exit site

300
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,320
we have three active entry exit sites up

301
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
with two more plans

302
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,079
they were chosen for their geographic

303
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,720
diversity and physical proximity to our

304
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,920
partners at indiana gigapaw and lumen

305
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,000
the standard sites are very sad and

306
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
disappointed in lonely sites because

307
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,120
unfortunately they don't have firewalls

308
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,600
they have all of the other links the 100

309
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,519
megabits per second wayside channel

310
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,200
optical service channel

311
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,399
the layer 3 backbone the layer 2 overlay

312
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,120
and the 10 gig connection but no

313
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
firewall

314
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
this is a remote site which means it has

315
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
a router but it does not have an optical

316
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,040
node

317
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,600
it also has a wii firewall which is a

318
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
juniper srx345

319
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,240
i'll pop the links up but i think you

320
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,120
get the picture by now

321
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,680
our secure management network is good

322
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
enough smart enough and dog on it people

323
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
like it so we monitor it just like we do

324
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
its older sibling

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
two walks a day

326
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
homemade food who's a good network the

327
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,160
whole nine yards

328
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,240
we've had a homegrown configuration

329
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,079
management tool that we've used over a

330
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,760
number of platforms over a number of

331
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
years where our next generation

332
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,480
infrastructure network is using cisco's

333
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,399
network services orchestrator for

334
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,959
automation standardization and policy

335
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,079
management

336
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,920
we are working on migrating the secure

337
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,760
management network configurations over

338
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,079
to nso and hope to have that completed

339
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,279
soon

340
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,240
now

341
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,839
i don't know if any of you have been in

342
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,519
the position of creating a whole new

343
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
firewall rule set where none existed

344
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,560
before

345
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,519
if so

346
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,360
my condolences

347
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
we had a couple of access lists that

348
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,440
were created back in the dark ages

349
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
i should specify that i mean like 2010

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,120
thereabouts not the last two years

351
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
our optical management platform was

352
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,120
changing our partner networks were

353
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,240
changing

354
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,160
so which roles did we need and which

355
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
rules could be discarded

356
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
what did the manufacturers say their

357
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,480
required ports were and what were they

358
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,000
really

359
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
did anyone really know

360
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,720
when you thumb things but not everything

361
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
so we bit the bullet and did the only

362
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,760
reasonable thing we ran away and cried

363
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,560
no

364
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,880
then we looked at the old acls and used

365
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,040
those as a basis for creating a bunch of

366
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,480
rules we did add a permit and log at the

367
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,560
end as a catch-all because we didn't

368
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
want to block required traffic

369
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,440
since the juniper firewall logs include

370
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,079
the name of the firewall rule that's hit

371
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,760
this allows us to look at what's being

372
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
permitted by each rule to ensure that

373
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,720
the rules were working as intended

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,639
it also allowed us to look at what was

375
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,399
being caught by the permit and log at

376
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,800
the end so that we could go back and see

377
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,560
what was being permitted that we didn't

378
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,320
know about

379
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,240
we established slack channels with the

380
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,880
stakeholders for each zone type and used

381
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,360
those to help us create new rules with

382
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
the goal of removing the permit and log

383
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,720
entirely

384
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,639
it also helped us identify a few

385
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,320
misconfigurations

386
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,079
when the performance monitoring servers

387
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,880
for example were using a legitimate but

388
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,519
not previously accepted by us ntp server

389
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,079
that it helped us to work with the

390
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,920
management team for the performance

391
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,519
monitoring servers to resolve the

392
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,600
problem in a way that was easiest for

393
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
them

394
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,279
in this case it was for them to push out

395
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,959
the correct ntp settings to those

396
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,120
servers themselves so we didn't even

397
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,199
have to make a firewall change

398
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,199
if it had been easier to make a firewall

399
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,800
change that's something that we would

400
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,079
have run through our normal change

401
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,720
management process

402
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
that's not to say it's all been sunshine

403
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,160
roses

404
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,519
there

405
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
may be a rule whose name contains

406
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,680
which is meant to just

407
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,240
silence the one host who refuses to

408
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,199
change its syslog settings so it stops

409
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,079
filling up my logs

410
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,000
eventually we got rid of the permit and

411
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,240
log rules and no engineers were harmed

412
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
in the process

413
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,079
that's what they told me i had to say

414
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,920
we finally did the boring grown-up

415
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,880
security thing and created some policies

416
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,440
governing creation modification and

417
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
removal of rules

418
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,839
we have a specific workflow where new

419
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,399
rules must be requested and documented

420
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,240
so they can be reviewed on a regular

421
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,360
basis

422
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
and of course all changes have to go

423
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
through change management so i have a

424
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,279
couple of templates created for my team

425
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,199
to make common things like address book

426
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,479
changes easier

427
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,000
i have a little bit of extra time it

428
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,920
looks like so i'd like to go a little

429
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,759
more in depth into the firewall rules

430
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,279
that we've created and what we've

431
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,800
learned from them

432
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
more work work work

433
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,600
work work work work i'm kidding

434
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,399
i told you there'd be more sesame street

435
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,600
fun fact

436
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
before this presentation i have not

437
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
noticed that the swedish chef has human

438
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,240
hands

439
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,800
true story you're saying it now i know

440
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,320
you're welcome

441
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,040
of course we have a few next steps

442
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,120
we have an ongoing review process to

443
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,519
determine if any rules can be removed or

444
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,920
combined and we have monitoring in place

445
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,320
to check on unexpected changes in

446
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,639
permitted or denied traffic

447
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,880
we've created workflows around verifying

448
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,800
firewall address books based on our

449
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,399
internal source of truth

450
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,240
and we'll be creating workflows out of

451
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,759
the configuration once we move to nso

452
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,240
i need to clean up some broader ssh

453
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,320
rules and remove some redundant rules so

454
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,040
those two things are on my to-do list

455
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
for instance we have a global rule

456
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,399
that's permitting radius which is

457
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,320
processed after all the zone specific

458
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,959
rules so we don't really need a radius

459
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,680
rule for each zone do we

460
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
my co-worker has been working with an

461
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,160
open source firewall documentation tool

462
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,759
which will make it easier to parse the

463
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,680
configuration so that i don't need to go

464
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,759
back and make those changes manually in

465
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,360
our documentation after the fact

466
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,720
shoot

467
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,040
i totally forgot that i meant to do that

468
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,000
could one of you guys remind me thanks

469
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,079
additionally we want to enhance our

470
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,000
firewall reporting by finding rules that

471
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,480
aren't being used and can be removed

472
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,959
which kind of begs the question

473
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,280
can you splunk that which doesn't exist

474
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,119
we had quite a bit of fun each trying

475
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,439
our hands at various vulnerability

476
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,079
assessment tools against our new devices

477
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,160
from points inside and outside the

478
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,240
secure management network

479
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,840
we have a commercial product as our

480
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
primary means of assessment but we

481
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,280
wanted to see if we could find any

482
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,840
interesting tools for our purposes

483
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,520
my coworker tried some things that he

484
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,960
found on github

485
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,520
and i ran through some kali linux tools

486
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,360
we documented our findings so they can

487
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,760
be repeated in the future as needed say

488
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
after we do a software upgrade need to

489
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
reassess

490
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,559
we also really want to simulate a full

491
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,640
site outage to verify that failover

492
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,720
works as it should for the secure

493
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
management network and for our internal

494
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,039
pools at some of those sites

495
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,960
and of course training our other

496
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,840
engineers on basic firewall tasks

497
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,520
after all you can lead a network

498
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
engineer on water but we also need to

499
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
make her secure it

500
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,000
the easiest solution can be nice when

501
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,760
you're running a network but it's

502
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,520
probably not ideal for a firewall

503
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,120
configuration

504
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,960
thank you for coming to my ted talk i

505
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,600
mean my nano presentation

506
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,760

matthew ptek asks adair your

523
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,679
architecture seems to rely entirely upon

524
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,679
the optical network being present and

525
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,160
available in order to work for both your

526
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,960
in-band and out-of-band 100-megabit osc

527
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,039
channel if the optical platform

528
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,679
completely dies do you have dial-up or

529
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,240
other oh access path into your

530
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240

531
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,080

532
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,760
