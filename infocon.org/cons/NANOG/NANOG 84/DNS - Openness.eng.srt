[Music]

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,120
um good morning good afternoon good

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,000
whatever everyone look um

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,240
i'm sorry i'm not there i think we all

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,880
are it's been going on for so long and i

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,520
don't want to make a habit of doing this

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,359
so i promise as soon as they let me on

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,439
planes i'll be there and i'll be with

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,760
you but uh no this is another of these

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,800
virtuals

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,920
um

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,760
increasingly though as we sort of sit

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,880
here and contemplate the industry

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,719
because in the absence of face to face

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,320
and talking about new things to do we

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,160
get more introspective

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
some of these topics i think get really

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,360
important

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,920
and one i wanted to talk about today

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,200
is one of these

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
topics that underpin

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,280
what we thought was so good about the

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,480
internet

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,879
you know the the issue was

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,800
it's open

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,039
now open is a really big word

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,239
it means lots of things all the time to

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,680
all kinds of people

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,520
if you talked to some kinds of

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,120
regulators

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,119
and you talked about the openness of a

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,479
service

33
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,560
you might come up with this definition

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,080
which is actually one that was used in

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
europe by the european regular

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,159
regulatory forum

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,880
mouthful of beric you know can users

38
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,759
access this service no matter what

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,280
machine they're using no matter what

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,360
form of access they're using is the

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,479
service

42
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,040
universally accessible

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,920
and and it's bizarre to put that

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,079
question in the context of the dns

45
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,439
because that was the point of the dns it

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,439
was actually engineered

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
to deliver the same answer to the same

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,799
query irrespective of how you actually

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,479
formed that query

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,880
you know what machine what platform what

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,799
operating system what software didn't

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,759
matter the dns was not built to give

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,840
different answers depending on who you

54
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
are where you are what software you're

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,719
using that wasn't the point

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,399
the point was everyone got the same

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,920
answer it's the same result that name

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
has the same binding in the dns

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,038
irrespective of who's asking so you know

60
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,440
if if access to the service

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
is the real underpinning question about

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
whether the dns is open you know the

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,760
answer is yes and i'll just stop now

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
but you know

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
it's not yes

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
we don't all see the same dns we really

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
really don't

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
because it's not fully open fully

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,319
uniform fully accessible you actually

70
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,360
look at what names can i resolve that

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,959
you can't

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,440
or what names can you resolve that i

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,080
can't and of course depending on where

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,440
you are

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
to pose that question you will get very

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,080
different answers we all know about

77
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,239
china and its efforts to resolve

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,800
facebook.com uh in the united kingdom

79
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
america australia all these and most

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
other countries

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
have various forms of dns based name

82
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,599
blocking for all kinds of motives

83
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
whether it's for content whether it's to

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
protect you from financial fraud or

85
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
crime or whatever

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,879
so

87
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,239
all of us do it

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
all of the time we don't all see the

89
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,840
same dns

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,560
now it's not always from sort of

91
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,959
governments and national regulators

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,200
sometimes isps just want money you know

93
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,360
who can blame them and one of the most

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
delightful ways of trying to monetize

95
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,239
the dns because i can't charge for

96
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,920
queries or answers

97
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,879
is to actually substitute answers

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,680
so if you ask for jeff's favorite you

99
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,799
know pizza shop.com it'll go nx domain

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,200
that name doesn't exist

101
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
but an enterprising isp from time to

102
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,840
time comes up with hang on a second

103
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
what if i send you back

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,319
an ip address which is the ip address of

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,239
my favorite search engine

106
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,760
and my favorite search engine will

107
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,000
actually pay me money to do this so i

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
can monetize the dns by substituting

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,239
answers when the name doesn't exist i

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,879
can push the search function into the

111
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,959
dns for money

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
so again different answers for different

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,200
people as a result

114
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,720
and there is an issue around threat

115
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,120
mitigation where the name itself isn't

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,639
resolved because

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,959
it's a feature something like quad 9's

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,358
effort to actually stop you going to

119
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,479
sites where we know there's malware and

120
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
again this becomes an issue with

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,400
parental controls and so on so

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,720
selectively answering the dns and not

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
answering every query has become a

124
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
feature not a bug

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,560
now is it a problem

126
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
not really

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,080
most of us think that threat mitigation

128
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
is a fine thing and you know nation

129
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,520
states since the

130
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,800
pact of west failure in 1648 do have a

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
sovereign right to do certain things

132
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,199
that you know um that's that's that's

133
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,479
the rules

134
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,880
and it's a problem however when it's a

135
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,280
lever in a different fight when the

136
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
intellectual property right interests

137
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,120
start blocking some of these sites that

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,720
actually do uh pirated videos etc and

139
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,320
all of a sudden there are folks who want

140
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,759
to get there anyway and there are folk

141
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,199
who want to block and it becomes an

142
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
escalating problem

143
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,680
but in the grand scale of things not

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
really a big issue

145
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,800
so let's go back to the original

146
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
question about open

147
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,680
we might not mean open as a service but

148
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,360
open as a system

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,759
for those of you like me old enough to

150
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,440
remember the rise and fall of osi the

151
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,240
open systems interconnect open was being

152
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,400
used at the time to contrast against

153
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,120
vendor proprietary systems it was kind

154
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,680
of this is closed because unless you're

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,199
me ibm whatever you can't do this versus

156
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,680
open here's the spec here's even the

157
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
source sometimes yeah you can build your

158
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,639
own version that's okay so is the dns

159
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,960
open in that sense and the answer again

160
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,800
emphatically

161
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,440
god yes it is so open

162
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,560
it's openly specified no ipr encumbrance

163
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,520
nothing

164
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
it's actually available as open source

165
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,039
if you look around there's so many

166
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
source implementations of dns these days

167
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,080
dns res name servers

168
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,800
are openly promiscuous

169
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
they'll answer anyone

170
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,880
and sometimes that's a bug but name

171
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,759
servers will answer anyone irrespective

172
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
of who asked

173
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
the information itself in the dns openly

174
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,919
available there's some sort of

175
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,840
qualification here that almost a bit

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,000
like a phone book the individual entries

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,080
are certainly there but the collection

178
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
might be not available and certainly

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,039
some zones don't do and allow zone

180
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,360
walking but you know if you do a query

181
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,160
you get an answer anyone can do it so

182
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
the queries the responses even the

183
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
protocol

184
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,039
is open

185
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,520
you just look and you'll see

186
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,560
answers

187
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,599
questions and answers which you know in

188
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,919
this day and age was about the worst

189
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,000
possible thing we could have done it's a

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,360
massive problem

191
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,319
because

192
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,680
it's a weakness

193
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
because now

194
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,199
the dns is the universal clue of the

195
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
internet it's not ip addresses it's not

196
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,039
connectivity sorry about that

197
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,880
the actual underpinning of what defines

198
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
the internet is the dns it is the

199
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,080
namespace and if i can see your queries

200
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,919
in real time

201
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,520
i don't need to know anything more about

202
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,360
you i know you

203
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
i know what adware you're running i know

204
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,199
what you're doing

205
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,840
and interestingly if i could jump into

206
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,599
that conversation that you have with the

207
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,400
dns that your system is doing and make

208
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,120
some services disappear i could do that

209
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
if i could change responses i could

210
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,560
control it this is an awfully big area

211
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,000
of vulnerability

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,319
and in today's surveillance economy and

213
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,000
you know that's what we live in in terms

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,240
of the capitalist the uh survey

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
surveillance capitalism which is really

216
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,120
what drives the internet these days

217
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,759
if i know the dns i know you and if you

218
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,639
took google if they bother to look

219
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,479
the wealth of information they get

220
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,160
because literally about one-third of the

221
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,319
world's users send their queries to

222
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,759
google

223
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,919
why bother doing anything else you know

224
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,479
it all if you look at the answers

225
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,680
so

226
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,280
let's unwrap this a little bit because

227
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,440
this is starting to get slightly chilly

228
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,479
um

229
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,960
what does the dns do it just takes human

230
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,120
use labels you know a string of words

231
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
sends them into the dns system and up

232
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,039
problems the protocol address that you

233
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,280
can then connect to but what's in that

234
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,000
system what is sort of sitting inside

235
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,280
that cloud

236
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,839
and interestingly for an open protocol

237
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,000
with open source

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
it is one of the most opaque systems

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,519
we've ever built

240
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,880
you can't see

241
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,799
you don't know

242
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,360
once a query goes into the dns

243
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,959
it gets lost

244
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,760
because when someone else asks something

245
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,839
related to that query what are the name

246
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,080
servers for jeff favorites pizza.com

247
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
that's not me asking anymore

248
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,399
it's some kind of recursive resolver

249
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,160
asking and so

250
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
the elements don't forward the original

251
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,839
query

252
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,320
recursively that is go and do their own

253
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,360
so you can't tell how a query tracks

254
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,920
through the dns infrastructure you can't

255
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,959
probe it

256
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
you have no way of knowing where the

257
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,959
answer came from is that a cache is that

258
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
from an authoritative server

259
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,040
who gave you that answer

260
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,720
nobody knows

261
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,399
there might even be query chains in the

262
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,440
dns because it doesn't use any kind of

263
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
queries a query counter

264
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,519
there could be queries in the dns that

265
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,839
have been circling there for years

266
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,920
no one knows

267
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,800
and so

268
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,320
what's the level of

269
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
interdependency in the dns how many name

270
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,959
servers get involved to support your

271
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,120
name

272
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
no one knows

273
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
and it sort of leads to the observation

274
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,519
that in terms of the modern miracles of

275
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,360
our technological world

276
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,640
the dns is up front and center as one of

277
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
the most astonishing the fact that it

278
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,040
works at all you know is amazing the

279
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,200
fact that it works the speed and volume

280
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
we've actually built for it is is

281
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
incredible

282
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,040
if we were sitting back in the early

283
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,240
1980s trying to design a dns to handle

284
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
the trillions of queries that it has to

285
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,399
handle and the milliseconds of time

286
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,519
tolerance we'd all give up and go sorry

287
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,560
you are joking can't do it

288
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
we've done it amazingly

289
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,920
but you know the dns is more than that

290
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,240
the dns is a whole lot more than that

291
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,279
because when we use dns as a term

292
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,640
we're talking about a whole bunch of

293
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,120
things almost as substitutions for each

294
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,920
other

295
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,399
you know it is a namespace

296
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,320
um

297
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,240
google.com nano.org and so on the

298
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,680
collection of word strings in a

299
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,680
hierarchy the hierarchy is actually

300
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,800
important

301
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,320
it's actually name registration

302
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,160
framework we've got a whole bunch of

303
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,640
folks slaving away in the name industry

304
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,959
to run registries and registrars and

305
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,360
handle provisioning protocols and make

306
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
sure the authoritative servers are

307
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
loaded with the right right the right

308
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
information and that's a business you

309
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
know we all do this for money

310
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
um it's a distributed database if you

311
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,519
think about it where this large sort of

312
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,120
mapping system

313
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,920
is not like a dictionary in a single bit

314
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,320
of artifact it's smeared all over the

315
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,760
internet where little bits of

316
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,640
information sit all over the place and

317
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,079
the dns protocol itself wanders through

318
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,800
that thread uh resolving individual

319
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,000
names it's a protocol query response and

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,040
interestingly it's a signaling medium

321
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,240
because the dns is everywhere and

322
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
supported everywhere

323
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,320
you could use that for good or bad it's

324
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
up to you

325
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,399
so

326
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,040
this is an astonishingly complex system

327
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
and the next thing to actually ask is

328
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
who's in charge

329
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
and the answer is nobody it's just a

330
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,760
market

331
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,160
it's completely deregulated so if we

332
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,680
want to talk about

333
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,600
how the dns works

334
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,839
how open is it it's really a question

335
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,560
about markets and market signaling

336
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,399
not a question about someone telling us

337
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,600
what to do

338
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,839
nobody's telling us what to do the

339
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,320
market is telling players what they

340
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,839
should be doing and there are a whole

341
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,079
bunch of markets it's not just one top

342
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,079
level labels registrars clients

343
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,560
resolvers you know this page has it all

344
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,000
i'm not going to spend the time listing

345
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
it out but you understand that there are

346
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,920
a whole bunch of these markets

347
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,000
and and maybe it's actually more than

348
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
these markets

349
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,320
it's actually a set of needs

350
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,720
and so when we talk about the openness

351
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,040
of the dns what we really are trying to

352
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,959
understand is do open markets work for

353
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,720
the dns

354
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,120
and to what extent are they failing now

355
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,560
the fact that you're getting names

356
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,360
resolved here as i speak uh kind of a

357
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,040
test to the fact that that's a stupid

358
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480
question but maybe it's not

359
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,320
maybe there are some quite deeper

360
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,800
questions here because if we are talking

361
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,040
about the orchestration of a whole bunch

362
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,320
of markets

363
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,440
we're actually talking about the

364
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,320
internet itself not just the dns and we

365
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,800
can take the dns as an example

366
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,560
to sort of think about

367
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,720
how the internet is evolving as a

368
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,000
completely deregulated activity where no

369
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,519
one and nothing is in charge

370
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,959
now if we want to talk about these

371
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,800
themes of you know outcomes there's

372
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,160
control privacy trust fragmentation

373
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
aggregation centralization

374
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,760
abuse you know all of the typical topics

375
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,560
of our times um but i always want to

376
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,320
concentrate on a few because you know

377
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,639
time is short and at some point you've

378
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,639
got to lose interest i'm sorry

379
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,920
so i'm just going to take a couple of

380
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,320
these themes and actually look at where

381
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
they're heading and why and the first of

382
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,880
these is actually the open market for

383
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,519
trust for credibility

384
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,519
do you believe the dns

385
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,760
now you might have a rather more

386
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,920
jaundiced view of the dns

387
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
but your browser doesn't but your

388
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
operating system doesn't all of the

389
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,120
elements of the machinery you use

390
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,440
totally trusts the dns

391
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,760
this is beyond credibility it goes

392
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,399
straight into credulity and slams right

393
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,959
past it everything the dns tells your

394
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,600
machine your machine believes

395
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,560
should you believe it of course not

396
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
of course not you have no idea where the

397
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,040
answer came from as we've already said

398
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,079
it's open anyone can alter the answer

399
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,720
yeah we can we can do this better with

400
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
digital cryptography

401
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
but you know

402
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,880
do consumers prefer

403
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,800
signed answers

404
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,199
do they even have the ability to express

405
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,839
a view i only want to go to names or

406
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,760
resources that are signed with with

407
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,920
dnsec i don't want to go to any of these

408
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
other untrustworthy names

409
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,120
rubbish you have no choice where your

410
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,839
applications and services take you to

411
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,800
and so if that's the case we haven't

412
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,360
actually made a good job of this have we

413
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
dns sec is certainly there and we did an

414
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,279
amazingly clever job in adding

415
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,399
believability credibility to dns

416
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,680
responses despite all the challenges

417
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,079
we managed to attach digital signatures

418
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,399
to this data and actually allow the end

419
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,199
user if they so desired

420
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,040
to actually check that the answer they

421
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,920
got

422
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,680
was the answer that was originally

423
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,600
published in the dns

424
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,959
wow

425
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
what an achievement

426
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,959
now you'd think

427
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,800
that everyone wants it

428
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,360
i have a domain name of course i would

429
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,440
like folk to trust the resolution of

430
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,759
that name of course i would really not

431
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,880
like someone else to intercede and send

432
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,560
folk elsewhere when they were coming to

433
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,519
my service so of course i want trust

434
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,560
users

435
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,639
don't want to be misled they really

436
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,279
don't and so it seems that everyone

437
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,680
wants to use dns sec because it's in

438
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,600
their interest

439
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,880
so everyone wants to use it

440
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,639
how much is out there

441
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,320
well if you live in the united states

442
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
you're kind of orange bad is red good is

443
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,519
green you're not green

444
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,920
saudi arabia is green uh our friends

445
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,480
sweden and and finland are green uh

446
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,160
australia's kind of orange new zealand

447
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,720
is green yay new zealand and china is

448
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,680
red

449
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
so all over the world

450
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,720
there's an awful lot of sort of

451
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
disparity and you might think that

452
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,000
everyone wants to do this

453
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
but united kingdom no italy no spain no

454
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,920
they don't

455
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,199
now

456
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,360
if you actually look at this and graph

457
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,480
it as i've been doing for way too long

458
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
just under 30 you know it's a little

459
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
over a quarter of users sit behind

460
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,279
validating dns results they won't take

461
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,959
you to the bad place

462
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,560
on the other hand

463
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
three-quarters of the world's users

464
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,240
don't seem to care

465
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,759
they don't check

466
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,360
trust is kind of the answer somebody

467
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
else's problem not mine i don't care

468
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,880
send me somewhere else tls saves

469
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,959
everything per not

470
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,839
um

471
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,400
and so the issue is we don't do it

472
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
now part of the issue is the technology

473
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
is hard large responses

474
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,640
the technology takes time and we're

475
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,359
trying to make the whole internet faster

476
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,959
and dns heck is not faster it's slower

477
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,880
and quite frankly there's a whole bunch

478
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,800
of issues that everyone goes no

479
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,000
[Music]

480
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,880
not going to do it

481
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,240
and of course

482
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,080
with the onset of quantum coming along

483
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,840
at some point in the vague future we're

484
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,600
going to need bigger and bigger keys so

485
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,960
whatever the problems we have today with

486
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,160
dnsec is going to be worse tomorrow and

487
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,919
last and not least

488
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,039
very very few users actually validate

489
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,640
they trust

490
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,480
their recursive resolver to do it for

491
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,360
them

492
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,799
all of this work

493
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,880
and you still have that last mile going

494
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
near not a problem

495
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
it is a problem

496
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,559
and from this respect there's a huge

497
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,200
amount of effort in dns a huge amount of

498
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
effort

499
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,799
gain

500
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,760
no one knows marginal at best it's a

501
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
market failure

502
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,440
now why

503
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,240
well i talked about markets and the way

504
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,160
markets actually drive the internet

505
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,320
users don't pay for the queries

506
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,240
so while i might have a preference for

507
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,520
trust

508
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,840
i'm still going to pay the same amount

509
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,840
for trusted answers as untrusted answers

510
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,200
nothing nothing and so i'm not paying

511
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
and secondly i have no choice in what i

512
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,760
query for you know the names that my

513
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,240
machine tries to resolve is really up to

514
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,039
my machinery and up to folk who publish

515
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,520
services not the consumer

516
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,360
so i have no ability to express a

517
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,919
preference for signed names and so in

518
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,559
some ways cost and benefit are

519
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,080
misaligned

520
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,039
economics speak for market failure no

521
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,880
one's incented to do it

522
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
so trust

523
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,039
although everybody wants it

524
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,200
and we would all benefit from it

525
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
and it's being abused

526
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,360
in every way in shape for more than a

527
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,559
decade although trust is great

528
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,480
we can't seem to get to the room that

529
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,919
has it

530
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,919
because quite frankly if it wasn't for

531
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,080
google's public dns service there would

532
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,400
be no dns sec out there whatsoever

533
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,080
and the fact that around 30 percent of

534
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,640
the world's users actually use dnsec

535
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
validating resolvers

536
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,559
and the fact that around 30 of the

537
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,160
world's users send their queries to

538
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,240
google's public dns is not a coincidence

539
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,520
so

540
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
it's all there whatever what is there

541
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
because of google

542
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,640
and google's open dns so let's look at

543
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,440
google's open dns because this is an

544
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
open market you can set up an open dns

545
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
resolver i can set up an open dns

546
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,720
resolver it's an open market anyone can

547
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,919
do this

548
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,760
and this is another area where i've been

549
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,480
measuring so i measure the world's users

550
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,760
every day

551
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,880
and i look to see whose dns resolver do

552
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,840
they use and across the entire world

553
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,039
around

554
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,120
three quarters of the world's users

555
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,720
certainly do nothing

556
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,200
and their isp resolves their name

557
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,240
do you notice the weekend peaks

558
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,200
so in the enterprise world they

559
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
have a slight preference to use

560
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,360
something else but at home near whatever

561
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,120
the isp does

562
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,200
the next line is google

563
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
google has just around 30 of the world's

564
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,679
users send their queries to google and

565
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,360
although it's harder to discern you can

566
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,480
actually see

567
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
enterprise folk have a more higher

568
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,280
preference for google than the isp it

569
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,400
tends to peak in weekdays not weekends

570
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
just under that because of the artifact

571
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
of where resolve is set

572
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,360
around 20 of users send their queries to

573
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
resolvers in a different network uh but

574
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,679
in the same country and it's just likely

575
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,840
to be internal to the isp

576
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,000
all the rest of these open resolvers

577
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,679
yeah it's just noise

578
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,360
you know it's one two three four five

579
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,919
percent and that's it so it's it's your

580
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,360
isp or google

581
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,000
so if this is an open market it's not

582
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,200
very good um google 30

583
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,000
cloud flare four open dns two quad nine

584
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
point five percent

585
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,080
um and everything else is just your isp

586
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,720
so it's a really good question

587
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,000
this is not the outcome of competition

588
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,880
this is the starting position

589
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,120
how did google succeed

590
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,520
and everyone else not

591
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,200
if user share

592
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,240
was the goal if user share was the goal

593
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,159
and part of the effort is

594
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,960
when i use the words name resolution

595
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,600
economy i'm kind of lying it's a

596
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
contradiction in terms clients don't pay

597
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,799
for dns resolution services so you know

598
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,080
outside of your isp it's unfunded by me

599
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,280
and you

600
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,120
and efforts to monetize as we've talked

601
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,679
before like nx domain substitution are

602
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,000
generally frowned upon we all get frowny

603
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,039
faced when when folks substitute answers

604
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,480
not a good idea

605
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,799
and so if i'm running an open resolver

606
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,440
i'm doing this as an act of charity

607
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,679
and the more people that use me the more

608
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,000
i need to spend money on machinery

609
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,799
money that no one's paying me

610
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,760
and so

611
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,720
i'm heading into success disaster

612
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,960
the more successful the service the more

613
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,440
i have to find money and the less i'm

614
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,039
going to get users to give me money

615
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,039
because they're not paying

616
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,840
now

617
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,080
why does this work for google and no one

618
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,280
else

619
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,520
well the issue is google isn't doing

620
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,600
this because they're nice

621
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,760
they're doing this because google is an

622
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,520
advertising company

623
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,280
and what they're selling

624
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,240
advertising is based on search and so

625
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,280
the major asset from google is search

626
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,559
now it is trivially possible to use the

627
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,039
dns as a search engine you just take all

628
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,880
those nx domain answers and send them

629
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
into a search engine going

630
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
you're trying to get to jeff's favorite

631
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,799
pizza.com i'll tell you what why don't

632
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,039
you go to jeff favoritepizza.com today

633
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,039
you because i know better than you we

634
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,080
could do this but if we did it's google

635
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,840
that has the problem

636
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,320
and so it's in google's interests

637
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,120
to make sure the dns is not

638
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,200
a de facto search engine to make sure

639
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
that dns does not become abused as a

640
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,960
fuzzy search algorithm a bit like search

641
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
is meant to be

642
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,919
it's makes it's in google's interest to

643
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,480
keep search and the dns

644
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
widely separated

645
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,080
and so google's spending money on a fast

646
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,360
accurate

647
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,200
incredibly efficient

648
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,720
dns service

649
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,039
but nevertheless honest

650
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,919
it's what's in the dns nothing special

651
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,240
that's google's interest to do and

652
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,880
almost no one else no one else has that

653
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,799
special motivation

654
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,240
so

655
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
let's see where this works

656
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,720
where it goes the open market

657
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,880
fragmentation

658
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,600
because in the name resolution economy

659
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
everyone just uses the defaults

660
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,440
and and for the isp

661
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,039
they don't have an interest in making it

662
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,320
better

663
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,799
because when i pay my 10 bucks a month

664
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,720
100 bucks a month a zillion dollars a

665
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,760
month to my isp

666
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,559
the

667
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,120
quality of its dns is not part of my

668
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,960
decision

669
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
and so running a better dns doesn't make

670
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,159
my isp more popular or less popular

671
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,760
makes no difference to my choice as a

672
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,559
consumer so that means that the dns for

673
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,760
isp is cost not revenue

674
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,159
and like any other cost element

675
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,159
increasing the costs of something where

676
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,480
i don't get increased revenue is a bad

677
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,279
thing

678
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,480
very bad

679
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,640
and and so what this leads oddly enough

680
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,520
is resistance to change

681
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,360
because if folk don't care about a

682
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,799
better dns

683
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,279
and a more up-to-date dns

684
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,320
they don't

685
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,640
make it better they don't keep it up to

686
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,960
date they just run it as being

687
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
functional and that's it

688
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,880
and so an isp doesn't have a huge

689
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,279
department of the dns i often just

690
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,480
outsource this because it's cost they

691
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,320
don't change their platform settings

692
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,200
nothing

693
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,559
users

694
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,880
don't bother either they just tend to

695
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,120
take the settings from their isp the

696
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,240
defaults

697
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,039
and so in some ways nobody has an

698
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,159
interest

699
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,039
in making things different

700
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,600
now if that means i want to change the

701
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
dns

702
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,840
i have this great new idea

703
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,440
the issue is

704
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,679
how do i get people to use it how do i

705
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,080
get isps to pay the cost of actually

706
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,559
deploying this changed infrastructure

707
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,240
platform providers to put it in this

708
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
software how do i get everyone to change

709
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,360
the answer is

710
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,440
well that's normally a money problem but

711
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,919
if no one's paying money it doesn't

712
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,120
happen

713
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,559
and so while there's been a lot of talk

714
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,000
about dns over tlsd and over https dns

715
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,880
over this over that

716
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,440
the prospects don't look good

717
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,039
it looks like being a whole lot of

718
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,919
effort in failure

719
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,679
but maybe not

720
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,200
maybe not

721
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,799
because

722
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,200
what we're going to do instead

723
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,440
is fragment the dns and actually

724
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,400
contemplate

725
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,240
the unthinkable

726
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,679
because quite frankly this is a

727
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,240
two-speed industry if you work in the

728
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
transmission infrastructure and isp

729
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,600
world

730
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,760
you're down in the utility commodity

731
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,039
world a bleak world of low margin

732
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,919
a bleak world of commoditized service

733
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,159
a bleak world that doesn't give you room

734
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,480
to innovate a world where your

735
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,200
investment in existing infrastructure

736
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,120
is so big

737
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,600
you cannot afford to change that

738
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
infrastructure

739
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,240
because if people aren't going to pay

740
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
you any more money you're just not going

741
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,600
to do it

742
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,559
and so

743
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,520
that sort of half of the one-speed world

744
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,080
is running in very very low gear it's

745
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
just commodity it just wants to do what

746
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
it did yesterday

747
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,400
but all the money is in applications and

748
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,720
services these days if you look at the

749
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,960
top 10 companies in the world by market

750
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,360
capitalization they're they're all in

751
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,320
the services area be it microsoft google

752
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,799
uh facebook no sorry meta uh and a bunch

753
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,720
of others like that

754
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,440
they're all in the application space and

755
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,120
the folk who actually want to make

756
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,480
changes

757
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,520
and do really cool things to make their

758
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,799
services better faster more responsive

759
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,320
more tailored who want to change the dns

760
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,360
are in the application world not the isp

761
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,559
world

762
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
and so what we're going to do

763
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,320
and we have no choice it's just going to

764
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,279
happen

765
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,120
is the application space is going to

766
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,200
hide the dns off for itself

767
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,080
and create application specific services

768
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
using

769
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
dns over https

770
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,320
why not if i can't change the existing

771
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,640
infrastructure tunnel through it

772
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,240
and if i really don't want anyone

773
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,159
interfering with my tunnels encrypt the

774
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,200
tunnel

775
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,000
so

776
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,919
there's sort of a generic observation

777
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,360
here that's actually true for a whole

778
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,440
bunch of infrastructure

779
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,360
we are now the incumbent not the

780
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,640
challenger

781
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,960
the sunk cost in infrastructure is now

782
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
so great

783
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,880
that we can't even contemplate changing

784
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,679
it

785
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,240
the saga of the transition to v6 has

786
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,640
been such a protracted saga

787
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,039
not because it's hard not because we

788
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,480
weren't aware

789
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,799
but because of the cost of changing

790
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,880
everything was so high it was hard to

791
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,720
actually find that window of opportunity

792
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
that said right everyone let's spend the

793
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,480
money and do it

794
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,720
and when you leave it to piecemeal we

795
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
simply spend all of our effort back

796
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,279
hauling capacitor compatibility and just

797
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,039
nothing happens

798
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,919
so the folk who want to move

799
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,000
stop waiting for everyone else to move

800
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,840
they stop trying to

801
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,080
fund everyone else to move they stop

802
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,399
trying to drag the ball and chain along

803
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,440
with them they just sever that chain and

804
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,960
do what they want to do

805
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,120
using whatever tools they can

806
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,200
and this is true of the dns it's true of

807
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,559
a whole bunch of other areas of

808
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,720
technology the folk who have the money

809
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,120
in the will just go and do it and use

810
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,360
the existing infrastructure as little as

811
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,960
possible tunnel through it with

812
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,360
encrypted tunnels

813
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,200
all the money these days is in content

814
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
you know that i know that applications

815
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,360
drive the internet market this is why we

816
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,200
have content distribution networks

817
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,520
driving the architecture of the internet

818
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,279
this is why no one cares about routing

819
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,600
anymore this is why transit is dead

820
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
because the network we're building now

821
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,799
to make things bigger to make things

822
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,679
faster in a world of abundant comms an

823
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,320
abundant community we just shift the

824
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,960
content closer and closer to the user

825
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,799
it's cheaper

826
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,760
and so what we now do is actually draw

827
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,240
in these services such as the dns

828
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,880
to tunnel through the existing legacy

829
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,520
infrastructure and simply not pay anyone

830
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,039
to upgrade we just bypass them

831
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,880
and so what we're doing is effectively

832
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,760
doing application specific name spaces

833
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,399
and applications have really no interest

834
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,360
in helping everyone else along

835
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,960
they have no interest in sustaining a

836
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,520
single name space or even single uniform

837
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,760
protocol interoperability

838
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,039
they don't

839
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,480
they're not going to pay

840
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,039
so they're going to go their own way

841
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,760
and when we sort of contemplate this

842
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,720
the market forces that unleashed a whole

843
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,520
bunch of players in a theoretically open

844
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,039
market

845
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,919
unleashed a bunch of forces that caused

846
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,880
that market to fragment in a very very

847
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,720
weird fashion

848
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,360
and actually into a world of

849
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,039
application-centric services

850
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,200
it's still i think

851
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,360
the internet

852
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,200
but it's awfully hard to tell with cdns

853
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,240
with any cast because packets don't move

854
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,320
around the world anymore from this

855
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,559
client to that service

856
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,039
users access services and the network

857
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,360
infrastructure cdns and whatever and

858
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,840
including the dns get swept up into

859
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,080
doing this in invisible and seamless

860
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,840
ways and so whatever you thought the

861
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,360
internet was in 1980 1990 the year 2000

862
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
you are wrong today

863
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,399
the entire internet is not a single

864
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,799
unified coherent space anymore it's a

865
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,440
whole bunch of competing spaces

866
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,080
so is it open

867
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,120
well you know sort of

868
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
there are still niches and opportunities

869
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,039
to play the shop is not closed the

870
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,640
technologies are certainly there and

871
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,519
available but

872
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,679
i think it's the failing days of this

873
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,840
it's the sunset of openness because we

874
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,360
can't keep it together because the

875
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,679
market forces that drive the internet

876
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,120
are actually driving us towards

877
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,600
specialization and fragmentation and you

878
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,919
know this common benefit of a single

879
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,480
cohesive internet a single cohesive

880
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,760
address space

881
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,840
a single cohesive transmission

882
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,679
infrastructure that brings users to the

883
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,880
service

884
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,320
is about as dead

885
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,480
as the concept of a single cohesive open

886
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
namespace

887
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
but this is not unique

888
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,640
we were there before we'll be there

889
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,679
again this is the tragedy of the commons

890
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,159
unfolding before our very eyes

891
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,039
thank you very much

892
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,360
thank you very much jeff this was very

893
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,679
very entertaining thank you

894
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,519
at least we can smile as the building

895
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,440
falls down around us absolutely

896
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,320
absolutely the least we can do right

897
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,880
the the the one question i have is

898
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,480
which is jeff's favorite pizza

899
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,679
excellent

900
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,480
so i'm happy for once we didn't wake you

901
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,000
up at five o'clock in the morning which

902
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,080
is great so am i here i am yes

903
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,600
thank you

904
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,279
thank you as well thank you for your

905
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,480
28th

906
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,720
talk for the nano community thank you

907
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,480
very much

908
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,519
so

909
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,080
we have time for questions i don't know

910
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,799
if anybody in the room would like to

911
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,639
go first while we are waiting for

912
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
just state your name and affiliation

913
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
joshua parish with santa rosa

914
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,600
communications so you kind of alluded at

915
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,919
this but do you think this fragmentation

916
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,559
in the name space could also happen in a

917
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,519
numbering space

918
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,399
i like the way you phrase that as a

919
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,240
future possibility

920
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,000
and not as a past historic fact

921
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,399
we broke the name space with the first

922
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,120
map and didn't realize it

923
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,080
but when v6 came along to try and

924
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,919
restore a single unified co-easy address

925
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,720
plan

926
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
where every connected device had a

927
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,199
unique globally unique ip address

928
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,679
we as an industry said

929
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,918
nah don't need it

930
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,639
and here we are in 2022

931
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,800
and no one ever thought that i knew

932
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,599
before carrying a single packet

933
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,639
yet

934
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,359
two thirds of the world don't have

935
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,960
ipd6

936
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,359
this is a fractured v4 internet where

937
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,119
the address space is completely broken

938
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,159
i'm coming to you from network 10.

939
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,320
so is most of the world

940
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,719
when i go to any car services addresses

941
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,159
just don't matter

942
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,719
they're just an ephemeral token to

943
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,960
distinguish one conversation stream from

944
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,679
another and as soon as this stream stops

945
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,440
someone else is going to use my ip

946
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,639
address

947
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,440
the whole idea that ip addresses make

948
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,000
sense anymore as the europeans would say

949
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,280
they're part of some personally

950
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
identifiable information

951
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,160
is just such rabid tribe

952
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,000
it's just the denial of what addresses

953
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,359
really are

954
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,480
we broke the addressing plan a long time

955
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,599
ago

956
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,920
and we're okay with that

957
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,440
we're okay with that because these days

958
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,560
addresses aren't the thing

959
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,800
clients don't need addresses we don't

960
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,000
care

961
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,720
servers need names

962
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,240
and the only reason why i'm talking

963
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,839
about the dns

964
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,640
is that the only thing left that defines

965
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,480
this internet as distinct from a bunch

966
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,200
of others is the namespace

967
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,839
the fact that when i talk about

968
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,280
google.com and nano.org it means the

969
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,160
same to you as it means to me

970
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,560
so if we break the namespace the address

971
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,640
space ain't going to help anyone that's

972
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,520
gone

973
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,440
and if you think you can deploy v6

974
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,800
globally and restore a networking

975
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,400
technology that died in 1995 and build

976
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,280
it again in the 2020s good luck to you

977
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,920
you know i will watch you quietly and

978
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,000
bring some popcorn because it ain't

979
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
going to work

980
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,880
so that world is over addresses are dead

981
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,320
and reviving net 240 is not going to

982
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,359
change that picture one iota you know

983
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,720
get over it when at it it's over and so

984
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,960
what's left is the name space consider

985
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,560
your question will addresses get us out

986
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,720
of this hole of course they won't

987
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,960
and so the look of the dns and what's

988
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,440
going on there is actually fundamentally

989
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,839
critical to everyone in that room and in

990
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,280
my room too

991
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,079
the dns is actually our network

992
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,920
and once you look at that

993
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,240
and you look at what's happening

994
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,599
that's the point where we shall get

995
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,800
worried

996
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,359
because all those dns resolver engines

997
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,119
and cpes dns mask and so on with code

998
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,320
written in oh my god 1995 and never been

999
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,680
upgraded

1000
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,920
it's never going to change

1001
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,240
and so the frustration

1002
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,920
of folk like well google facebook amazon

1003
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,839
all those content folk

1004
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,079
that want to make the dns faster want to

1005
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,040
make it more capable want to have svcb

1006
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,440
records and so on to turn the dns into a

1007
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,839
phenomenally efficient rendezvous agent

1008
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,680
look at the installed dns infrastructure

1009
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
and go oh my god

1010
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,520
can't make it work

1011
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,440
so what do we do instead

1012
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,079
tunnel through it fracture it build our

1013
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,760
own little area for our own little

1014
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,839
application space and say well

1015
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,400
now that i've got my own dns

1016
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,960
i can do all kinds of names i can add

1017
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,440
application signal i can go my own

1018
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,800
direction

1019
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,960
and everyone's having that thought

1020
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,280
and the end result is you know

1021
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,720
we broke it

1022
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,599
whoops

1023
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,880
so yeah

1024
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,640
address fragmentation is not in your

1025
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,879
future it's deeply in your past

1026
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,599
thank you

1027
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,400
we have jeff we have one question online

1028
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,200
uh bear with me because it's a bit long

1029
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,720
so this is from matt pitak underemployed

1030
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,320
i love this

1031
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,800
so his question is

1032
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,160
want having all the dns for applications

1033
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,000
over to dns over https end up solving

1034
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,960
the cost model for isp resolvers

1035
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,359
as the isp resolvers will end up with a

1036
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,040
tiny cache of dns over https endpoints

1037
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,079
to cache rather than a huge array of

1038
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,800
real name to ip mappings

1039
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,760
the volume of queries to isp resolvers

1040
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,320
may be high but the number of different

1041
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,240
name lookups becomes trivially small

1042
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,440
we're special

1043
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,160
you know here's this black box

1044
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,720
and the last thing you should ever do oh

1045
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,359
user of black boxes is to change the

1046
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,880
settings

1047
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,119
and so when we say that 30 of the

1048
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,960
world's users send their queries to

1049
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,760
google it is not

1050
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,920
not because they wandered into the

1051
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,480
setting tabs and made some changes

1052
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,720
they don't do that

1053
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,800
the whole reason why google has such

1054
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,119
market share is they've persuaded a

1055
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,800
whole bunch of internet service

1056
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,680
providers to simply put in a dns

1057
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,680
resolver that consists of a one-line

1058
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,720
forwarder

1059
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,040
send all the queries to google

1060
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,960
so i get rid of my cost

1061
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,720
i send queries to google so what it's

1062
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,359
free i've got rid of cost users get a

1063
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,400
really fast and accurate dns service

1064
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,160
everyone wins and so today's reality is

1065
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,000
that that's already what's going on and

1066
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,960
yes

1067
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,000
there is no earthly reason why an isp

1068
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,560
should continue to run their own dns

1069
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,119
other than nostalgia and a desire to

1070
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,040
burn some money down the back which

1071
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,680
which sounds insane these days because

1072
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,359
why bother

1073
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,480
now the problem is of course that

1074
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,880
other folk want to get inside this act

1075
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,240
and those other folk aren't different

1076
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,640
isps or open resolver servers that's not

1077
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,720
story it's actually the application

1078
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,680
space

1079
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,160
and the application space it wants more

1080
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,599
functionality

1081
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,200
and so you can either sit there in the

1082
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,359
ietf and add new service records and

1083
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,520
change this and change that and you know

1084
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,359
how long does it take to get an rfc out

1085
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,680
there these days well if you're ultra

1086
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,839
lucky five years

1087
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,040
if you're standard longer how long does

1088
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,839
it take from idea to rfc to

1089
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,280
implementation we don't live that long

1090
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,160
so

1091
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,280
why bother why should i go down a

1092
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
standards track when i can just as

1093
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,400
easily use https the application

1094
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,720
particularly a browser sends its queries

1095
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,359
to servers that have not only a dns sort

1096
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,599
of database but a whole bunch of names

1097
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,920
signals and parameters that help my

1098
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,839
application over at the client side do

1099
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,960
better

1100
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,119
now that's a really long gap between the

1101
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,440
client and the data center

1102
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,760
no it's not

1103
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,680
it's just down the road

1104
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,920
the entire cdn industry and the way we

1105
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,839
do applications now is we're compressing

1106
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,079
the internet down to this last mile

1107
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,040
service

1108
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,359
and we're using oddly enough the dns and

1109
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,599
actually taking the technology

1110
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,599
ripping apart the global functionality

1111
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,200
of the dns and putting back inside that

1112
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,440
services and functions that we would

1113
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,520
find almost impossible in a big

1114
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,119
mothership dns

1115
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,000
but disgustingly easy in a lightweight

1116
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,839
sort of transaction protocol which is

1117
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,520
the dns today

1118
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,720
so matthew

1119
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,520
yes isps will happily walk away from

1120
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,880
cost

1121
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,040
but they're not giving up

1122
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,119
a version of the dns that they ran

1123
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,720
against the version of the dns that

1124
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,040
google's running they're giving it up

1125
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,359
against application level fragmentation

1126
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,560
and signaling

1127
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,359
and and the end result of that is we are

1128
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,280
almost accurately

1129
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,359
reinventing that bizarre world of

1130
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,680
fractured bulletin boards and discrete

1131
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,000
networks of the 1980s

1132
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,599
whereas instead of bulletin board

1133
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,520
operators we're talking application

1134
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,040
ecosystems

1135
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,760
the chrome ecosystem

1136
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,400
the mozilla ecosystem

1137
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,720
the linkedin ecosystem

1138
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,000
where each

1139
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,119
area like meta wants to keep you locked

1140
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,240
in there and not let you out

1141
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,839
and that's what we're building why

1142
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,640
because that's where the money is and as

1143
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,480
i said earlier in this talk

1144
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,000
no one's in charge

1145
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,960
there's no master plan it's just money

1146
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,119
and if you look at where the money goes

1147
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,040
the money is busy ripping apart what we

1148
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,960
spent the last 20 years building because

1149
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,599
you know greed you know this is where

1150
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,119
more money is

1151
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,760
and so in creating what we've done

1152
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,280
we sowed the seeds of its own

1153
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,760
destruction so great question matthew

1154
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,440
thank you but i'm not sure you like the

1155
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,760
answer

1156
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,920
he says safari bbs for the win

1157
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,599
apple have their own hooks in you and it

1158
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,680
i don't think safari was a big a big

1159
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,200
part of that plan but uh yes the safari

1160
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,359
bbs is certainly part of it mozilla's

1161
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,319
gone man um chrome has gone there in

1162
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,680
spades

1163
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,560
you know the google ecosystem is is

1164
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,760
scary

1165
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,119
and you know i'm just waiting for

1166
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,200
facebook to say i'm sick and tired of

1167
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,359
chrome in fact all the browsers looking

1168
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,920
over my shoulder

1169
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,240
you're going to run my app why because

1170
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,319
no one else gets to see what's going on

1171
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,119
and i keep control of the user so yay

1172
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,960
this is you know i'm sure there's a

1173
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,720
department in meta right now and it has

1174
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,560
been for years trying to build something

1175
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,359
along those lines

1176
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,599
excellent thank you very much
