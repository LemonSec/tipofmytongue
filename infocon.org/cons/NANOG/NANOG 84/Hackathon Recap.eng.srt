2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,240
welcome to nanak 84 hackathon it's been

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,120
a very successful weekend of hacking uh

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,799
first we're going to start with the

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,759
organizers of the event so michael why

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,160
the theme giving back to open source

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,119
because uh all of us who are here using

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,439
um using this open source software we

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,439
use it day in and day out we were

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,039
fortunate enough to reach out to a

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,439
number of project maintainers

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,200
from uh gnmi gateway to gmic container

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,399
labs scrapply scrap to go foxen napalm

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,480
vaping uh and hearing tv um and so like

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,800
the uh all of the maintainers were very

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
gracious to come here and help us to

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
develop so that we can help them and

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
give back to the community so why the

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,960
scavenger hunt and making the

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
infrastructure available as a network

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,719
engineer lab so

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,480
i think a lot of people are generally

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,719
intimidated by this concept of hacking

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,719
and wanting to get into software we are

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,879
after all a networking first conference

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,879
so we wanted to just make things as

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,439
welcoming as possible to as many people

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,799
take the site like a real big event and

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,119
so if somebody wants to is a little bit

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,840
curious about this but isn't quite brave

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
enough to jump into uh software

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,640
development and hacking on their own um

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,479
or right off the bat they can come in

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,560
here and just start with a

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,759
scavenger hunt where they've learned

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,439
something or just be able to use the

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
network infrastructure we have to start

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
developing network engineering skills

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
perfect so any idea of what the theme

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,840
will be for nanolog 85 well we're going

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,880
to see what people think about uh the

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
theme this time around we have had the

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
largest number of participants uh since

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,799
we started the virtual and hybrid uh

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,759
format of the hackathon and so if this

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,640
is a popular uh format we'll probably if

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,880
this is a popular topic of working with

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,719
popular open source projects we'll

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,640
probably do it again awesome thank you

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,560
michael and carl can you turn on your

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,439
camera

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,680
not at the moment i'm sorry i'm a little

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
in the middle of some stuff yeah

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,160
okay no problem carl uh so what help

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,038
were you able to get this weekend um we

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,280
got a contribution to scrapply netcomp

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,360
to add commit confirmed which is

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,400
probably a feature that should have

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
already existed but uh

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
dennis was able to add that so i just

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
kind of worked with him um

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,160
fighting winters and appeasing

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,599
formatters and all that kind of stuff he

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,879
did pretty much all the work without

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,720
really any any help for me so i had a

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
pretty easy time of it so what help were

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
you able to provide

68
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
uh yeah just working through like

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
formatting errors and appeasing my pi

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,480
and some stuff like that from a typing

71
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,879
perspective since python project

72
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,840
um

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,720
really

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,400
like i said pretty easy on my head so

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
dennis did all the hard work so it's

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,200
pretty chill

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
so why is that important though

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,599
well the linters are just there to kind

79
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,599
of make sure everything stays tidy and

80
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,440
orderly and all that so

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,959
but of course every project has a little

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,319
bit different

83
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,680
setup with different linters or

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,360
different you know configurations for

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
those so it's you know it's always kind

86
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
of probably a pain for for people to

87
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
jump in and contribute so just try to

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
help kind of steer that and get

89
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
everything get all the checks passing

90
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,760
green lights everywhere and all that

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,879
jazz

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,959
absolutely well thank you thank you for

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,239
all your help

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,760
as

95
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,000
we appreciate you talking to us today

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,640
uh is there another project maintainer

97
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,480
that would like to

98
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
uh share

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,879
i'm leo vegoda uh representing peering

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,239
db

101
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,120
and um we

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
um worked on

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,000
a project this weekend um most of the

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
work well i say

105
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
more than 99 of the work was done by uh

106
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
renato uh

107
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
almeida olivieri

108
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,080
and uh what he did was uh he built api

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
uh search

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,519
intersection uh functionality for

111
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,720
peering db so this means that if you

112
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,360
want to find out where

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,560
a set of as numbers appear at

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,000
um an internet exchange point or an

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,879
inter interconnection facility instead

116
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,120
of having to query one by one and then

117
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,200
build up your own data set and then do

118
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,399
your offline analysis you can just ask

119
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,478
one question to peering db

120
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,000
and it can give you um one answer and

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
that's done over the api

122
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,080
so um it was a

123
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,600
very specific feature and now we have

124
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
that

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,199
we will need to duplicate functionality

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,600
on the web interface because we try to

127
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,080
keep parity between the two interfaces

128
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,280
but we have this and we're going to

129
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,320
um

130
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,919
line it up for

131
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,680
uh beta testing and then production

132
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
deployment so um

133
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,720
uh really grateful to

134
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,320
nano for hosting this hackathon which is

135
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,479
um you know delivering results for the

136
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,840
peering db community thank you so much

137
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,000
very good thank you so much leo

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
i always appreciate your time and energy

139
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,639
i

140
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,840
i would love to talk to a participant

141
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,880
if anyone would like to step in

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
okay so

143
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,840
we are team nable and yes ken was in the

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,880
team uh and we also had leo

145
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,000
myself

146
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
christian and josh

147
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,280
and we are from network to code

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,039
and

149
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,840
we

150
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,919
want to share our learning experience so

151
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,440
these talking points are to keep me on

152
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
track actually

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,639
so we had a very mixed team

154
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,520
from first-time contributors to up to

155
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
maintainers and all the levels of

156
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
experience in between

157
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,240
what helped us at on uh was the labels

158
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,880
so we were able to search for good

159
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,680
issues to work on uh so please keep

160
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,440
adding those they had a lot of great

161
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
content the reviews were very

162
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,759
constructive and we learned and we

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,199
improved our prs

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,880
some prior work

165
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,440
that we've managed to finally finish

166
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,240
in this hackathon and of course mircha's

167
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,639
availability the maintainer of this

168
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,199
project it was wonderful for him to jump

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,120
in any problem and help us and of course

170
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,479
a solid testing framework that nepal has

171
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,039
so thank you for that anything that

172
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,680
we did if the unit test broke and we

173
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,639
were able to figure it out and solve it

174
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,400
so we did a lot of stuff we

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
contributed uh four different things uh

176
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,840
for napalm core uh did some time

177
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,720
um

178
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
did an advanced method for diff config

179
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,919
for cisco and xos

180
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,479
we also added net utils for cisco

181
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,840
confirms and fixed the gpl license and

182
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,520
added some mac ip checks for getters

183
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,400
we also had the napalm panos

184
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,520
where we added log configuration the

185
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,440
ability to load configuration and new

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,759
method our tables

187
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,639
we did all the jazz we could for that

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,680
repository to add actions and pie pie

189
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
and all of these fun things

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,319
we found the bug and fixed the bag for

191
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,560
getting the faces and fixed another bag

192
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,599
for lldp so by the numbers this was

193
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,319
really incredibly fun uh we did we had

194
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,360
four pr's uh and uh most of them have

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,479
been merged uh so we fixed three issues

196
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,960
in the core two bugs fixed and we

197
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
touched a lot of files so hopefully we

198
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,400
didn't break anything

199
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,240
um and then for panos seven pr's

200
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,720
features four new features three fixes

201
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,039
releases uh three releases actually

202
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,479
during this weekend

203
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,960
and several hours of fun and learning so

204
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,440
we want to thank you the organizers for

205
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,080
giving us the opportunity to give back

206
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,800
to

207
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,319
the community and especially project

208
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,599
that is dear to our hearts and we also

209
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,120
want to not thank git rebates

210
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,080
because that gave us

211
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,919
a lot of pain however you know this is

212
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
what happens when lots of people fall

213
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,520
into something and all that so that's it

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,080
all right i guess um i'll just go gonna

215
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
go next

216
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,759
hi everyone

217
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,080
my name is alex

218
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,039
and

219
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,839
we had a team here at hackathon

220
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,880
with barry and and tony

221
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,320
so it was

222
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,719
really very productive i mean i enjoy it

223
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,839
a lot

224
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,640
yeah alex why did you choose the topic

225
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,399
that you chose

226
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,519
i i like on my daily job i work a lot

227
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,040
with uh emulated topologies um

228
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
and it also always this question okay i

229
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,760
defined it in this you know

230
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
text file format

231
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
what it's really like

232
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,200
we are looking to leverage visualization

233
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,000
to just show counters and stuff like how

234
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,519
traffic flows through the topology that

235
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,519
would be helpful so jay what was the

236
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,760
most rewarding part of this

237
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,519
well like i said i i wasn't planning on

238
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
working with dnash today but the most

239
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,160
rewarding was was just really the

240
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
serendipitous way of finding

241
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,600
something you know something to do and

242
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,279
create something

243
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,640
that i didn't

244
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
plan by myself but just came together

245
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,600
out of

246
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,040
work together with several different

247
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
people what what was the most

248
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,519
challenging it's a there's so many

249
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,880
factors and things that go into

250
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,360
networking um

251
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,760
i know some things uh other people know

252
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
some things it's finding the common

253
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
ground

254
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,399
and what did you learn about your skill

255
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,200
set during this process i had a plan of

256
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
what i wanted to

257
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
to achieve right i had a

258
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
i wrote a blog post when i started i

259
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,519
defined a list of methods and apis

260
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,120
and that was going to be my you know

261
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,040
completing that was my

262
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
today and

263
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
on one hand we didn't

264
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,079
we could say we didn't achieve what i

265
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,600
set out to achieve right we didn't reach

266
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,079
all those those markers

267
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,800
but um together with dinos you know he

268
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,760
was able to submit uh to contribute to

269
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,279
the project as soon as i believe what

270
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,279
may have been his first full request

271
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,800
ever right

272
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
so he you know it was a small thing he

273
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
changed a little flag there was a flag

274
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,880
that larissa box needed in order to

275
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,120
speak gmail

276
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,160
into

277
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,040
uh insecure flag he changed it from true

278
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,880
false or close to truth

279
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,560
it's small but it was you know a small

280
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,120
step for for man

281
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,360
except for mankind

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,279
i love that thank you so much jay i

283
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,680
really appreciate you uh sharing with us

284
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,640
today

285
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,079
we're a group of students from ball

286
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,240
state university in a master's program

287
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,000
studying information and communication

288
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,279
sciences

289
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,079
i'm robin and i have a history in

290
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,640
network and system administration so i

291
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,399
have an interest towards that technical

292
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,440
side of things today we worked on mostly

293
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,279
figuring out how to connect to these

294
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,360
instances as well as

295
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,240
getting familiarity with the terms and

296
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,560
the new systems for me this was my first

297
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,040
time not using cisco so it was really

298
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,959
interesting to see the similarities and

299
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,160
the differences

300
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
and for a lot of my classmates it was

301
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,560
first time seeing a lot of these things

302
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,920
so their experience was a little bit

303
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,560
different than mine

304
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,440
so my name is jacob smith um like robin

305
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,480
said we're in an information

306
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,959
communication sciences master's program

307
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,880
but i don't come from a tech background

308
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,480
i come from business i actually studied

309
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
anthropology in undergrad and it's my

310
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,560
second semester program so

311
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
it still gets my

312
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
footing with the old tech thing so it

313
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,560
was really cool to um work with robin

314
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,200
and

315
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,959
she knows a lot more than me so

316
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,399
there were a lot of things specifically

317
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,440
about

318
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,399
ssh

319
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,600
and

320
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
and

321
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,360
do a little bit of

322
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
open intel net

323
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,639
and then

324
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,839
learn a lot through the uh the

325
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,760
scheduling

326
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
you said this was your first time

327
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,040
doing something like this and your

328
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,279
background isn't in tech what would you

329
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,680
say to someone with a similar background

330
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,120
who wanted to try out something like

331
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,600
this for the very first time

332
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,519
i would just say

333
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,760
come to the open mind and

334
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,320
be someone who wants to listen to other

335
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
people and learn as much as you can and

336
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
don't try to be someone that

337
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,519
acts like you know everything about

338
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,200
everything

339
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
sound advice come here ready to learn

340
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,079
not ready to prove yourself

341
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,720
thank you so much jacob hi this is uh

342
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,680
sean i'm from coal technologies

343
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,200
so the purpose for me coming over here

344
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,680
there are three purposes of course like

345
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,800
anybody

346
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,120
so one is definitely all about tech

347
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,680
that goes on here i'm very intrigued by

348
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
all the new stuff that happens in the

349
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,399
industry

350
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,760
i do have a

351
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,839
cohort that i need to run into so

352
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,320
abdullah is here he's from center

353
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,880
so i run into him and then i have my

354
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,680
impress who i travel them a lot so it's

355
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,040
always a

356
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,920
a good meeting point so regarding this

357
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,000
hackathon

358
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,120
um so the guys that

359
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
at container labs they have done an

360
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,360
amazing work i must say because we all

361
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
know how we are comfortable with macs

362
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,000
and linux so what i put them to test

363
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,250
against is windows

364
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,800
[Music]

365
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,200
i have a surface and then i basically

366
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,480
installed the

367
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,910
instance of

368
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,680
[Music]

369
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,000
wsl which is the linux subsyst subsystem

370
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,480
available for use on windows

371
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,600
version 2

372
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,480
and then pull their container laps

373
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,040
into it and perform amazingly well so i

374
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,279
must congratulate them for getting it a

375
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,720
bit less

376
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
and basically it opens up heavily for

377
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,920
people to

378
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,279
adapt more uh pack more and it doesn't

379
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,880
get constrained by the fact that they

380
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,199
don't have mac all night so good job

381
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,920
guys uh i'm michael i worked along with

382
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,360
ali who will be coming up next uh i

383
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
i i've been really interested in

384
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,079
container lab for uh for a couple of

385
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,120
months now

386
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,440
and one of the things that i that i

387
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,800
think is really neat about it is how it

388
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,160
shows its uh its graph functionality now

389
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,519
the thing that i

390
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,880
thought uh i had a similar um

391
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,199
uh a similar want as uh uh alex barry

392
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,680
and tony except they did a much much

393
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,600
better job than the pack that i did

394
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
which was uh i see all these nodes

395
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,199
connected but i don't know what the

396
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,399
interfaces are so i went into the code

397
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,760
and i made uh interfaces nodes and then

398
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,120
connected the

399
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,680
uh the interfaces to the containers and

400
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
then the interfaces to one another and

401
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,720
so now the graph looks like this where

402
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,079
we have little dots representing the

403
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,160
interfaces and they connect together so

404
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,680
it's not the prettiest thing but it

405
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
gives us idea of topologies and so if

406
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
container lab wanted to start having

407
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,639
higher level constructs of things like

408
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
fabrics or line cards within the chassis

409
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,839
you can start improving these things in

410
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,120
layers that are that are connected

411
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,959
together um

412
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,880
and so ali do you want to say a couple

413
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
things of uh what you worked on thanks

414
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,959
michael so and thanks everybody for

415
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,399
putting the hackathon together it's been

416
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,880
a really cool experience i work with

417
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
michael and and but i work on more of

418
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,600
the layer one low voltage side so i'm

419
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,199
much more embedded in the physical layer

420
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,240
every day

421
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,639
so i really have not uh had an

422
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,120
opportunity to do anything like this

423
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,199
definitely at least at this scale but

424
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,639
i've been kind of working through my

425
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,360
career to try and expand my interest and

426
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,279
my knowledge in this space

427
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
so uh michael and i had discussed a lot

428
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,959
of different ways of kind of being able

429
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,560
to do that get the

430
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,079
visibility into things like this and

431
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,680
similarly to some people who had said

432
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,759
this i'd only really worked in the cisco

433
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,759
space so

434
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,440
first time working with

435
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,800
these applications it was really

436
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
interesting to see how the differences

437
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,040
of it and fumble through it

438
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,639
and then you know i i've never worked

439
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,959
nokia erisa devices before although we

440
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,639
do support them at our job or at least

441
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,720
tourist says so it was cool to kind of

442
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
see and get a little bit of a

443
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,800
look into that uh i definitely just

444
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,160
worked through a lot of basic commands

445
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,680
just kind of got a little bit of a

446
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,920
understanding of the space um michael

447
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,839
and i added a note in the topology so

448
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,360
that was really cool to see

449
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,279
he was also kind enough to find some

450
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,360
issues with bgp so we were able to work

451
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
through that and kind of just see his

452
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,920
brain work and how he was

453
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,160
troubleshooting so um not not that i

454
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,519
have anything to present but definitely

455
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,279
took away a lot and it was really cool

456
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,360
experience so so ali i do have a

457
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
question for you uh if you would have

458
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
done anything differently would you have

459
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,959
and what would have been um maybe i did

460
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,000
know we were going to work in the years

461
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,279
of space so i probably would have done a

462
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,120
little bit of research ahead of time or

463
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,680
even just like i term so i did kind of

464
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,639
fumble through a little bit in the

465
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,240
beginning to get set up and ready to go

466
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,639
and kind of understand the nuances maybe

467
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,839
just a little bit of googling ahead of

468
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,040
time would have helped me kind of kick

469
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
it off but i took a lot of notes and i

470
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,400
think the next time i'm kind of in that

471
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,559
cli space i'll do it a little better

472
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,480
and what are you most excited about for

473
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,799
future hackathons now that you have had

474
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,319
the experience

475
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,520
um i think

476
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,720
i think i feel a little bit more ready

477
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,559
to kind of get my feet in in other

478
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,319
spaces outside of the hackathon so

479
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,160
possibly the next time i do one i can

480
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,119
actually

481
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,640
give back as well

482
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
michael gave a lot to me but maybe next

483
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,400
time i will give something back

484
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,480
awesome thank you so much ali yeah

485
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,640
thanks the last thing is uh i want to

486
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,720
thank everybody who who came out this

487
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,799
has been our uh our best uh showing

488
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,280
since uh since the pandemic hit and we

489
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,760
went from uh up to early virtual man to

490
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
now this hybrid one so thank you all for

491
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,120
everyone who came out uh the

492
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,480
participants thank you so much um to all

493
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,360
of the project maintainers who came out

494
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,080
and i uh who helped out everybody who

495
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,880
was working here uh and uh very much

496
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,799
thank you uh especially uh of the

497
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,720
project containers to uh karim and to uh

498
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,880
enter roman for providing container lab

499
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,400
which we run all of our virtual

500
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,720
infrastructure on uh and thanks finally

501
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,520
to

502
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,640
us from aws uh for providing the virtual

503
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
the uh all these c2 instances that we

504
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,120
got to run this infrastructure on so so

505
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,039
thank you sponsors and participants

506
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
you
