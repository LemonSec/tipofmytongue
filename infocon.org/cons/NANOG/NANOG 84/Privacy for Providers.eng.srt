russ white who will be presenting

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,880
privacy for providers

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,439
russ is a infrastructure architect at

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,640
juniper

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,119
this is rust eighth time presenting at

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,560
nanog

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,320
uh rusford spoke with us at nano 60 in

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,279
2014 where he spoke about the trade-offs

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,520
in network complexity

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,600
welcome back to nanak ross it's a

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,000
pleasure to have you on stage today

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,079
thanks right here

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,480
all right

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,039
so i'm going to leave myself some notes

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,800
here anybody who's watched me present

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
before knows i like to walk around

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,039
um

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,640
so this is kind of an experimental

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
presentation

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
for those of you who know me well i or

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,239
don't mean that much even i just

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,719
finished a phd in philosophy and one of

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,440
the chapters of registration i worked on

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,438
involved privacy so i've been spending a

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,840
lot of time thinking about and studying

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
privacy and what it means

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
philosophically and stuff if you want to

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,119
get more into philosophy i'm doing a

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,360
session on friday with on safari books

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,439
online you can come to and hear me

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,840
chatter about what privacy means and

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,720
stuff

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,920
but this like i said is kind of um

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
experimental

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
and more of a discussion because i'm not

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,680
entirely certain

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,560
that providers and vendors

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
particularly of network monitoring stuff

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,880
have really thought through privacy

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,960
and where things come in so this is all

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,680
kind of new for me so bear with me as i

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,479
kind of figure out where i'm going and

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
uh you know feel free to jump in with

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,360
questions and stuff or comments because

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,960
again i think this we need to have a

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,479
discussion about this and figure out

51
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,040
what we're doing so i often hear things

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,119
when i talk about privacy like

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,719
if you have done nothing wrong you have

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,600
nothing to hide

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,960
or here is robert epstein

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,840
in

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,639
the um

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,318
legal regulation of genetic

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,000
discrimination

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,720
uh

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
from the boston university law review

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
the plea for privacy is often a plea for

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,200
the right to misrepresent one's self to

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,720
the rest of the world

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,280
um i'll just say this is total nonsense

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,720
privacy really really is important

67
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,120
to people for a lot of different reasons

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,480
first of all it has a lot to do with

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,040
identity formation and the right to be

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,840
wrong and to change your mind

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,560
and if you don't have privacy to to get

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,400
things wrong then you don't have privacy

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,760
to grow

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
we live in a world now where things are

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,200
recorded forever and if you're ever

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
wrong once

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,400
you're kind of screwed for the rest of

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,720
your life because nobody ever forgets

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,599
this is a privacy issue

80
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,319
there is an instance in a book called

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
what's the name of the book um it's

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
called the switch if you've ever read

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,640
that

84
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,760
of the importance of privacy a bunch of

85
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,560
a bunch among a bunch of medical interns

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,120
who were trying to change the culture in

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,519
a hospital and how important it was for

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,239
them to meet privacy privately to build

89
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,080
kind of their own culture there's a lot

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,760
of reasons that privacy is really

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,720
important

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,360
so bottom line here is

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,680
providers vendors the networking

94
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,120
industry needs to take privacy a little

95
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
more seriously

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,840
if you know much about the iapp or iaap

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
international association of privacy

98
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,440
professionals they do a lot of work with

99
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720
coders and stuff like that but the

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,879
infrastructure side of things isn't very

101
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,920
well covered so this is in my opinion

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,239
these kinds of excuses are nonsense and

103
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,599
we need to stop making those arguments

104
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,439
so the first question i have to ask is

105
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,680
is your transit provider

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
does a packet that i'm forwarding

107
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
through the network contain

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,799
what would be considered

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,120
private information

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
this is something i've talked to russ

111
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,200
housley about this and russ housley's

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,519
perspective is the answer is no the ip

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,920
address is not pii

114
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,360
privately

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,358
identifiable information or personally

116
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,918
identifiable information

117
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,320
i've spent a lot of time looking at this

118
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
question these are some definitions from

119
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,040
the gdpr and hipaa

120
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,120
about what is actually personally

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
identifiable information

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
and if you really look at these any

123
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,880
information relating to an identified or

124
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,440
identifiable natural person a data

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
subject or an identifiable natural

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
person who is one who can be identified

127
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,320
directly or indirectly by an identifier

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,240
such as a name

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
ip addresses appear to fall into that

130
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,600
even if you run them through gnats and

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
you do other things that are obscuring

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
so i would argue from the beginning that

133
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,199
yes ip addresses actually are pii and we

134
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,680
need to as networking folk

135
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,720
deal with that reality and figure out

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
what we do about it rather than saying

137
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,039
oh that's just not true

138
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,680
ip addresses are not pii we need to back

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,000
up and realize in some jurisdictions are

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,199
explicitly called out legally as pii and

141
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,800
we need to think through

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,039
what that means for network operators

143
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
and vendors and how that all is going to

144
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
come out so this presentation is again

145
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,960
kind of my initial thoughts in that area

146
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,800
there's nothing well defined here i'm

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,320
not going to give you solutions that are

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,039
like snap you can go fix this

149
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,199
again this is like okay i've been

150
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,000
looking at this this concerns me we need

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,520
to think about it

152
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,400
all right

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,479
so let's start with when i'm forwarding

154
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,759
a packet

155
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,680
does forwarding a packet

156
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,759
do what is called disclosure in the

157
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,360
privacy world does it disclose

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
information and this is where a lot of

159
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,840
people get really really messed up

160
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,479
around pii and ip addresses and deep

161
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,560
packet inspection and what's going on

162
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,800
inside the router theoretically the

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,600
router picks the packet up stores it for

164
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
some period of time and processes it and

165
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
if the ip address and other information

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,600
contained in the packet is in fact pii

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,160
then the router is handling pii

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,080
so this is something that people are

169
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,440
very concerned about normally i would

170
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,919
draw on the slide and i didn't set my

171
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,360
presentation up correctly for this

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,240
particular thing but

173
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,680
now i'm going to make an argument in

174
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,280
just a minute that it really doesn't

175
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,080
matter that the ip address is a pii but

176
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,280
let's try to look at some of the

177
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,840
dimensions of data to understand that

178
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
argument before i get into it so the

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,080
dimensions of data that you get into

180
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,160
with privacy professionals are things

181
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,639
like identifiability

182
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,960
what degree can you use

183
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,680
to what degree can you identify a person

184
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,000
from that piece of information i'll give

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
you an example that i use all the time

186
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,599
every time you call your bank what do

187
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,440
they say what are the last four digits

188
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
of your social security number

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
and they think they're being quite

190
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,240
clever

191
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,680
because it's not your entire social

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,919
security number and they're absolutely

193
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,800
wrong

194
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
the first

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,639
set of digits the first five digits in

196
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,120
your social security number are actually

197
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,560
set by the date and time and place of

198
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,800
your birth

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,039
so the fir if somebody knows your date

200
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,199
and place of birth they know the first

201
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,720
five digits of your social security

202
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,680
number

203
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,840
so if your last four digits are leaked

204
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,520
which are only based on time by the way

205
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
they now have your total social security

206
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,400
number

207
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,639
so identifiability is something that's

208
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,160
strange because it doesn't have to be

209
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
just one thing that identifies you it

210
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
can be your location plus your ip

211
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,039
address etc so network centrality is the

212
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,560
next thing that we talk about in privacy

213
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,280
in the world of privacy and this is the

214
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,840
degree to which information stays local

215
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,160
to the client confidentiality is the

216
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,440
extent to which information is

217
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,000
accessible by others availability you

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
can see these definitions for yourself

219
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,000
let's think about these things in term

220
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,160
of forwarding an ip packet

221
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,919
identifiability i've already said i

222
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,199
would argue that the ip address is in

223
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,960
fact pii

224
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
that it is it's called out in some

225
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,919
jurisdictions

226
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,520
but so we know that the information is

227
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,759
identifiable just from the packet format

228
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,680
or just from the packet itself but what

229
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,759
about networks and trility centrality

230
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,319
where's the information go it stays in

231
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,160
the router while it's being processed

232
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
and it's carried across the network host

233
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,519
to host

234
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,080
so therefore central network centricity

235
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,200
kind of is intermediate questionable in

236
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,080
the network forwarding process

237
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,640
confidentiality

238
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,519
how easy is it to access that data if

239
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,839
you're forwarding a packet how hard is

240
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,320
it to go on the console of a router not

241
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,160
talking about logging at this point

242
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,399
logging is a separate problem

243
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
how hard is it to see the data about

244
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,279
what's going on in the packet hard is it

245
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,360
to get to the console or the router to

246
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,959
be able to do the debugs to see the

247
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,800
packets that are being forwarded

248
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,560
so that's actually pretty difficult in a

249
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
network situation except for the people

250
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,959
who have the right access

251
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,600
availability well it's kind of doesn't

252
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
really seem to matter

253
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,399
integrity

254
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,680
integrity of course we expect the

255
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,160
network to carry data across it

256
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,640
with integrity and mobility doesn't seem

257
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,200
to apply very much to a networking

258
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,160
situation so i would say from a pii

259
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,560
perspective when i'm forwarding packets

260
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,000
if i'm looking at the privacy of the

261
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
information the only thing that really

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
hit me are the identifiability and the

263
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,399
network centricity i think that my

264
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,800
confidentiality is pretty high now the

265
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
other aspect that privacy professionals

266
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,080
talk about is the use of the data is

267
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,839
this the primary use for the data or the

268
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,640
secondary and this is where really where

269
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
we get to the nuts and bolts of dealing

270
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,360
with an ip address as a pii or as a

271
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
personally uh

272
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
identifiable piece of information

273
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,880
because i am using the ip address to

274
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,560
forward the traffic which is what the

275
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,360
user expects me to do

276
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,399
so there is an implicit draw there you

277
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,480
send me traffic it has an ip address on

278
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,839
it that ip address can can identify you

279
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,000
but you sent me the packet to do

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,440
something with it

281
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,160
therefore from a privacy perspective i

282
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
have a defense in that person from that

283
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,760
perspective right there

284
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,839
so again questionable definition

285
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,399
dependent confidentiality seems to be

286
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,399
high availability seems to be

287
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,680
variable integrity seems to be high so

288
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
i am using it for the primary purpose

289
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,279
for which the data was provided to me

290
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,079
so it seems to me when i look at routing

291
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,959
a traffic droughting traffic looking at

292
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,800
the way i actually process packets in a

293
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,760
network

294
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,839
privacy when processing the packets is

295
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,440
not a big deal

296
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,200
because the privacy value of the

297
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
information being used the ip address by

298
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,079
itself is pretty questionable or not

299
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,200
complete

300
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
the second thing is it's being used for

301
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,120
its primary purpose

302
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
and the third thing is the confidential

303
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,959
confidentiality of the information is

304
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,800
actually pretty high it takes a lot of

305
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,560
work to get to the console and do

306
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,279
something with it now the next question

307
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,720
that you should ask is somebody who's

308
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,560
forwarding traffic what about the

309
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,959
information inside the packet

310
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,120
frankly i don't have a lot of answers

311
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,920
here if i'm doing d packet inspection or

312
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,560
anything like that

313
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,079
a lot of this is going to depend on

314
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,120
encryption

315
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,079
so

316
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,680
for instance when i worked at linkedin

317
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,240
we had a project going to encrypt all

318
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
the traffic on the data center fabric

319
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,640
specifically for this reason

320
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,160
was to protect the privacy of the

321
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,440
information in flight across the network

322
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,320
so the network only had access to the ip

323
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
headers to do the forwarding but this is

324
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
really really unexplored space

325
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
so this again is where a conversation

326
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,320
could take place and we could think

327
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,639
about it

328
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,040
now let's talk about logging because

329
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,160
logging

330
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,959
is frankly what scares me when i first

331
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,760
started looking at this

332
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,200
we log things like the ip address

333
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,920
which i've already argued is pii

334
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,639
we log things like the location of the

335
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,320
user

336
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,639
some logging systems say okay where is

337
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,639
the user physically attached

338
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,959
when users are active we know that we

339
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
don't always log it but we know that

340
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,240
what users are accessing clearly we

341
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,000
logged that information or we know that

342
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,120
information

343
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,560
dns queries and responses the dns system

344
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
is a huge privacy leak

345
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,079
there's lots of privacy leaks around dns

346
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,920
and we really haven't started to address

347
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,519
those we think we started doing stuff

348
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,839
there with doh i would argue that's not

349
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,279
necessarily true there have been some

350
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,399
papers done on privacy leaks in doh

351
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,880
and dot that show that it's not quite as

352
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,800
private as we think it is

353
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
there are lots of things to think about

354
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,720
there and of course we have access to

355
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,760
access to the access credentials as they

356
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,240
fly across the network and sometimes if

357
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,959
i'm doing packet captures i'm actually

358
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,600
capturing that information in my logs

359
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,560
and again this is now pii

360
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,279
how many of y'all treat your log files

361
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,880
in your network

362
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,639
as private information

363
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,399
my guess is nobody

364
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,880
because we don't think about it that way

365
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,360
but the reality is from a privacy

366
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,000
professional's perspective from a risk

367
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,560
situation looking at it as a risk

368
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,800
this is actually private information

369
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,399
so now let's think about what we can do

370
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,040
about this let's say okay let's agree

371
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,639
or not agree or whatever let's have the

372
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,480
discussion is this private information

373
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,440
or not

374
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,959
but if i give that is private

375
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,600
information what do i do about this to

376
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,199
understand what i do about this i have

377
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,279
to start way back at the beginning and

378
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,079
start talking about what is a data life

379
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,639
cycle from a privacy perspective what do

380
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,399
i do with this data how do i handle it

381
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,800
in a way that makes sense from a privacy

382
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,920
perspective

383
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,639
so if i look at data life cycle i have

384
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,399
just three or four basic things i'm

385
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,480
doing with data i have collection

386
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,880
processing disclosure retention and

387
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,959
destruction those are the only things

388
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,639
that i really do with data from a

389
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,560
privacy perspective most of the

390
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,399
interesting things that happen to data

391
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
happen in the processing and disclosure

392
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
realm so i have two types of disclosure

393
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,639
one is use and one is breach

394
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,720
so of course a breach is an unattended

395
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
disclosure or disclosure to somebody who

396
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
shouldn't have the information and a use

397
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,279
is authorized use of the data

398
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
so i have these different steps so let's

399
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,079
think about this from let me see do i

400
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,079
have

401
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,360
okay so if i think about this from a

402
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,600
logging perspective right my collection

403
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,959
is logging

404
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,839
but do i have consent for capturing that

405
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,320
logged information that's pii

406
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,240
i would almost guarantee you you don't

407
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,079
do that we don't look at consent because

408
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,320
we don't treat this as pii

409
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,959
on the processing side when i look at it

410
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,120
am i transporting the data in a secure

411
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,959
way across the network

412
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,639
probably not because i'm not looking at

413
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
his private information

414
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,680
disclosures do i try to maintain against

415
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,320
breaches with my logging data most of

416
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,079
the time the answer is going to be no by

417
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,360
the way it's very interesting because i

418
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,000
just had a discussion with um

419
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,959
mira

420
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,600
who is um the chair of the ib and this

421
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
co this topic came up in the context of

422
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
the iab and she said well as a

423
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,360
university

424
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,440
researcher what you have to do is you

425
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,839
have to de-identify log information i

426
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,320
get from large providers

427
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,160
and i'm thinking yeah but we don't do

428
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,079
that internally we don't think about

429
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:44,959
that

430
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,279
so retention of course i want to retain

431
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,040
it and then destruction do i have a

432
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,160
clear destruction policy so

433
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,759
one thing is that we might want to think

434
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,519
about and this is a legal question this

435
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,000
is i'm not a lawyer so don't quote me

436
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,839
but you know this is something that

437
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,160
might be worth thinking about is do we

438
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,759
have consent policies around logging

439
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,720
we're logging people's pii are we doing

440
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,920
consent

441
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,199
is that built into the contracts that we

442
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,279
offer to our customers

443
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,440
or other things like that

444
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,279
maybe it should be maybe we should think

445
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,360
about that and think through the

446
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,880
implications of that part of our problem

447
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,720
space

448
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,560
now if i'm going to retain and use data

449
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,480
one thing i probably need to think about

450
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,120
from a privacy perspective is the

451
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,959
methods that i use

452
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,800
to de-identify or hide information so

453
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,199
that i don't have so what i want to do

454
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,560
in the world of privacy there's a

455
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,880
there's a thing around privacy is that i

456
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,959
don't want to get to my legal

457
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
responsibilities what i want to be is i

458
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,680
want to be risk averse i want to reduce

459
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,480
my risk i don't want to try to be just

460
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,959
legally correct i want to be and not be

461
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,880
legally culpable i actually want to

462
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,279
reduce my risk

463
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,439
so when i think about how to reduce my

464
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,679
risk with data there are in the privacy

465
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,039
world again there are several things

466
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,359
that you do you do dnf identification or

467
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,599
you do hiding hiding is of course access

468
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,799
controls encryption access monitoring

469
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,160
things like that is data being

470
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,359
exfiltrated dfinity identification has

471
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,000
three basic ways that they do this

472
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
suppression noise injection and

473
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,640
generalization or aggregation now the

474
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,840
nature

475
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,080
of data that we're dealing with in the

476
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,480
network suppression and noise injection

477
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,240
really aren't useful

478
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,760
right i don't want to inject false

479
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,720
um

480
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,320
sessions into my logs to de-identify

481
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,240
things that would be kind of silly it

482
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,760
messes up my network monitoring it

483
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
destroys my accuracy

484
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,520
noise injection suppression same thing i

485
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
mean i can't just remove things

486
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,039
so really what we have to get to is

487
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,559
something like generalization or

488
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,440
aggregation of data over time

489
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,360
and so i think that's really where we

490
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
should focus our efforts in thinking

491
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,280
about um privacy in logging and network

492
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,600
operations

493
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,120
now legally

494
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,480
most jurisdictions that write privacy

495
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,919
laws give users special

496
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,280
rights to data so again this goes back

497
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,840
to the legal requirements given by

498
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,679
different jurisdictions

499
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,200
you'll find california has this

500
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,039
particular law

501
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,840
gdpr hipaa all these things have their

502
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
own things but generally you can take

503
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,200
all of those things and put them into

504
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,640
one of these buckets

505
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,280
access so does the user have the right

506
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,320
to access the data that you have on them

507
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,360
this seems to me to be something that

508
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,080
would be applicable to logging data and

509
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,840
data that we're collecting as a network

510
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,240
operator in our normal operation

511
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,120
reification the right to co to correct

512
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,280
information so i can't figure out how

513
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,039
that one would apply to a network

514
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,760
operator because it's either

515
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,520
true or it's not true

516
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,760
like yes you access this network on a

517
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
certain date with a certain ip address

518
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,760
like i don't know what to be corrected

519
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,880
about that

520
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,160
deletion

521
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,039
maybe a user has a right to come to you

522
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,840
and say i really want you i'm i'm

523
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,760
dropping you as my service provider i

524
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,320
want you to drop all of your log entries

525
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,679
about what i've queried through dns

526
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,679
i don't know that's something that needs

527
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,600
to be thought out legally and figure out

528
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,360
like is that something we need to do

529
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,960
restriction

530
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
do users have the right to restrict who

531
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,120
the provider shares their information

532
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,080
with by the way this falls or backs into

533
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,520
the problem of net neutrality right

534
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
because net neutrality is in many ways

535
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,280
an argument over who gets the user data

536
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,200
and who gets to share the user data and

537
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,480
monetize it

538
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,720
so this is something else that we get

539
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,600
into

540
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,960
is

541
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,559
probably true

542
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,600
that a user should be able to say no

543
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,760
don't sell my dns queries to a third

544
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,520
party for analysis

545
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,320
for targeted advertising

546
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
portability doesn't seem to make a lot

547
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,640
of difference against automated decision

548
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,679
making

549
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,480
so

550
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,799
this is interesting because

551
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,480
here is where you're going to run into

552
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,640
things like cloudflare and alchemine and

553
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,000
dealing with

554
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,520
third-party marketplaces for

555
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
advertisements

556
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,679
and does the user have a right to not

557
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,840
have their information used to do

558
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,360
targeted information this is written

559
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,919
into gdpr it's written into california's

560
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,520
law it's written into a lot of other

561
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,760
laws and again it's something that we

562
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,200
don't think about as providers we think

563
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,760
it applies to google and microsoft and

564
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,799
others but really it probably applies to

565
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,039
cdns as well

566
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,720
so it's another area that needs to be

567
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,280
thought about private action

568
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,120
does the user have the right to take

569
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,280
legal action against the provider

570
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,720
probably doesn't make any difference but

571
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,120
anyway there are lots of things here

572
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
that we should think about that we

573
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,520
probably aren't thinking about very well

574
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,400
right now so my bottom line is this

575
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
we need to take privacy seriously as

576
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,520
providers

577
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,200
all kinds of providers we need to start

578
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,120
thinking about this it's only going to

579
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,440
take one major breach that releases a

580
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,120
lot of dns queries for somebody and

581
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,039
reveals some private information and

582
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,240
people are suddenly going to put the

583
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,200
spotlight on us

584
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
so the legal landscape is really

585
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,760
changing you probably need to consult

586
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,039
legal folk

587
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,480
whatever

588
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,799
again i'm not a lawyer so

589
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,960
that's pretty much it for me

590
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,799
unless you have questions i'm sure there

591
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,240
will be questions here someplace

592
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,000
yes

593
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
go ahead whoever wants to come to the

594
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,840
mic

595
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,280
hi this is barry cook i'm a

596
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,360
consultant and i do work for ethics and

597
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,480
fiber

598
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,840
and um

599
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,559
my question was what about

600
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,960
things like descriptions on access

601
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,080
switches and things like that

602
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,480
so those would be so privacy has two

603
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,559
dimensions right one is the end user's

604
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,240
privacy the other is protecting

605
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,760
proprietary information for your

606
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,679
operations so i would think that would

607
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,440
fall more into proprietary information

608
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,200
for operations and i would still

609
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,799
classify those as very important to

610
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,880
protect myself

611
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,600
yeah

612
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,400
so

613
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,360
thank you thanks

614
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
go ahead sorry i'll

615
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,120
my little actually i can um we have a

616
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,520
question from uh online

617
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,760
from their text don't apologize to

618
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,159
mispronounce the name uh the question is

619
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,600
is informed

620
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,760
consent relevant here

621
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,720
if data collected is spelled out in an

622
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,080
aup

623
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,919
and you know most people don't read the

624
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,480
aup does that matter

625
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,880
so the way most privacy regulations that

626
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,960
i've read are written

627
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,280
is informed consent has nothing to do

628
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,760
with secondary uses

629
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,520
you have to have informed consent even

630
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,000
for primary use cases so if you're

631
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,840
logging the data

632
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,400
even just to say i want to check my

633
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,480
network operations it's kind of

634
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,320
questionable but it seems like that's

635
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,760
something that

636
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,400
would need to be looked into and say

637
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,200
um

638
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,640
and different jurisdictions might have

639
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,360
different answers to that question but

640
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,720
i personally think that if you're

641
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,159
running at this point after

642
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,679
investigating this

643
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,080
if you're running a transit provider you

644
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,520
maybe ought to think about having an

645
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,679
informed consent thing in your contract

646
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,120
with your customers

647
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,799
and say please note i am collecting

648
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,400
information some of which may be

649
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,320
considered pii in certain jurisdictions

650
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,880
this is how i manage that data

651
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
kind of a thing

652
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,440
um

653
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,000
i have a question um the uh

654
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,240
we here as network operators sounds like

655
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,760
you're really i think this is very

656
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,080
helpful because you bring invisibility

657
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,520
for us to be aware

658
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,240
and

659
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
one thing for us is to think about are

660
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,320
we using the right protocols for

661
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,200
logging information and

662
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,679
do you have any recommendations and even

663
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,080
do we even have the protocols we need to

664
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,240
secure transfer is this something that

665
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,840
needs to be worked at itf or maybe it's

666
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,760
already being worked

667
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,120
so as far as i know there's no work

668
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,799
going on well there's sav there's a

669
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,000
couple of working groups that are

670
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,320
looking at privacy prefers preserving

671
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,760
transport

672
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,360
but

673
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,440
as far as protocols go no i'm not sure

674
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
that the protocols we have today other

675
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,559
