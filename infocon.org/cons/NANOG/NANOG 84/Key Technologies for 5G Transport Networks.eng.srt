00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,600
hi my name is igor jangrosi and i'm part

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,080
of the pre-sales team for iproducts at

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,360
nokia

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,360
i apologize for not being able to be

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,839
present in the stage today to talk to

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,240
you about this topic but unfortunately i

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,480
had some family issues that prevented me

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,920
from traveling

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
this is a session that i'm going to talk

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,320
about

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,599
transport technologies for 5g and it's

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,119
pretty much a

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,040
follow-up to the session that i did on

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,880
nanox 75

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
which was called the 5g uh an ip

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,079
engineer perspective so

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,920
if you don't know anything about 5g

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,480
transport or if you haven't

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,719
looked at any any perspectives please

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,320
take a look at that video

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,320
that will help in understanding the

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,600
technologies that i'm going to talk

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,879
about today

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,680
so let's get started uh i'll do this a

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,760
very quick review in case you haven't

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
seen anything but

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,399
in this slide you see

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,119
a 5g core which is represented by only a

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,400
single um a single icon in the top

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,760
and then you have the 5g radio so one of

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,200
the big characteristics of 5g is that

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,759
there are three layers inside the radio

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,400
or three different components

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,159
there's a component called the ru which

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,520
is the ring unit

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,119
another component called component

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,360
called the du which is the distributed

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,320
unit and another component called the cu

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,200
which is the centralized unit

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,439
this architecture was built essentially

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,640
with the goal

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
to have

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,920
some of these elements running in a

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,159
virtualized environment so

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,840
the cu

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,399
pretty much is the easiest one to be in

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,399
a virtualized environment it runs all

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,360
the non-real-time processes

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
the du

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
many times till today runs on

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,520
proprietary hardware it is becoming more

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,600
common also to have that

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,640
going to virtualize form factor and

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,119
together with the ru they run the

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,878
real-time processes so that's why you

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,840
see those two intra radio interfaces

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,720
there

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,239
um

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,160
with the name real time and non-real

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
time sometimes it's called

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,840
you know

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
non-real-time interface and real-time

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
interface so f1

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,080
interface for the um

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,160
the connection between the du

67
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,239
and the cu and then the connection

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
between the du and the rv

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,280
so the name in which those network

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
segments

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,959
are more known is

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,800
front hall for that connection between

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
the ru and the du

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,560
mid-hall which is the connection between

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,599
the du and the cu and then the

76
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,519
connection that already exists today

77
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,519
which is called backhaul so that is from

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,879
the radio

79
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,200
uh all the way to the 5g core so that

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
that is external to the radio that still

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,640
exists today

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,040
and a little bit of those differences in

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,680
the intro radio interfaces are related

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,440
to primarily

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,319
latency and bandwidth so the closer you

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,920
get to the ru

87
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,239
more bandwidth you need and less latency

88
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,280
you need

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,879
okay so

90
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,280
when we start looking into building a

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
network for 5g

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
um what happens is that very few

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
operators are going to build a new

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
network so most of them are upgrading

95
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,280
what they already had in place for 4g

96
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,760
and because of that um there's not only

97
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,799
obviously bandwidth upgrades which is

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,159
expected because of the higher

99
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,400
bandwidths of 5g

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,920
but but there's also some key

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
technologies that are needed to make all

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,120
of this work and in the next few

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,959
sections i'm going to go through some of

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,799
these key technologies

105
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,879
so the first one that i'd like to start

106
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,280
with is front hall

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
front hall

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
you know it is a technology that already

109
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,120
existed in 4g

110
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
uh depending on where you were in the

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
world it would be more or less deployed

112
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,680
but frontfall was primarily created in

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
4g with the idea

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,840
that you might have a big large building

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,160
and you put all of the baseband

116
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,279
processing on the bottom of the building

117
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
and you put the antennas on the top of

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
that building so you needed some sort of

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
protocol

120
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,320
to take um the antenna samples all the

121
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,040
way from the radio uh to the baseband

122
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
unit processing because if you just put

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
a um a waveguide uh that would uh have a

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,520
lot of loss so the digital way of doing

125
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,639
that

126
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,880
was a protocol called slippery and

127
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,360
that's what you see in the left side

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,199
of the slide so

129
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,280
slippery is an agreement of an

130
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,600
implementation for digital antenna

131
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,160
samples so that that's primarily this

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,120
you get

133
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
the samples from the antenna

134
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,600
you send those samples throughout this

135
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
uh digital protocol uh it is a tdm based

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,919
protocol primarily used with optical

137
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,080
connections could be used with

138
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,800
electrical as well but mostly used with

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
um with optical

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
and

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,919
it's a constant bit rate just because

142
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,160
you're getting every single antenna uh

143
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,720
samples every single radio sample and

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,199
sending that through a digital interface

145
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,280
it is a constant bit rate so it doesn't

146
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
matter if you have

147
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
many users connected to the radio or if

148
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
you have no users at all connected to

149
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,960
the radio you're always going to have

150
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,520
that same band

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,639
so uh there are a few other interesting

152
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,720
perspectives here on separate one is

153
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
that it carries synchronization we're

154
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
gonna have a whole section on

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,360
synchronization

156
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,000
um and i'll go into more details but uh

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,639
the cpr used for 4g carries embedded

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,680
synchronization so that's very important

159
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,199
and there's also some control and

160
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,680
management protocols that come with it

161
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
so because

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
the cpr protocol

163
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,039
does not vary with either usage

164
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,000
or

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,919
it only varies uh better said with the

166
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,160
number of antenna items or antenna

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,080
elements that you have there and with

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,199
the spectrum the the frequencies the

169
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,039
frequency band that the radio is

170
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,160
operating

171
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,400
when we look at evolving that radio to

172
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,440
5g

173
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,960
that protocol would become cost

174
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,160
prohibitive

175
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,800
just because we have more band more

176
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,319
band and the radio itself the

177
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,759
frequencies

178
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,199
and also a lot more antennas with mimo

179
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,680
so in order to enable that connection

180
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,639
between remote radios and centralized

181
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,199
processing in 5g another protocol had to

182
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
be built and the protocol that was built

183
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,400
was ec3 so you see on the uh right side

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,440
of the slide um the ec3 protocol stack

185
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,240
so

186
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
the basic idea here is just to get

187
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,599
simply over packet and in this case this

188
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,400
this packet is ethernet so you can see

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,199
the

190
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
either type and the bottom you can see

191
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,440
many familiar protocols here in the

192
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
screen as well

193
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,960
so

194
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,599
it is a ethernet based protocol but you

195
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,160
have also an optional ip layer that

196
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,599
makes it easier

197
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,080
for you to transfer that through

198
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,199
different types of infrastructures

199
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,120
one of the important things to note is

200
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,759
that ecpre doesn't carry synchronization

201
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,400
just like cpr did so because of that

202
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,280
now with ecpre we need the network to

203
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,199
provide synchronization for the

204
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,280
application which is the radio and

205
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
that's what we're gonna talk about in

206
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
the next section

207
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,720
um and the the biggest benefit of using

208
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,199
ecpre now is that you know all the

209
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,360
potential sharing of that ethernet

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,000
circuit uh between the radio and the

211
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
centralized uh processing in this case

212
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
uh it would be the du

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,520
um for 5g so there's uh an additional

214
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,240
tco benefit on top of that fiber

215
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,400
uh that that you can achieve with easy

216
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,039
now when you start looking at how to

217
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,319
transfer those packets for front hall

218
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,680
into an ethernet segment can we use a

219
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,960
simple ethernet switch well yes we can

220
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,840
but

221
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
there are some uh

222
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,199
there are some

223
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,520
care abouts that we have or some

224
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,120
concerns when transporting ec3 because

225
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,919
it's a very time sensitive product so

226
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,719
the ieee created a standard called the

227
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,279
802.1cm

228
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,360
which is actually

229
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,159
a set of already established standards

230
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,080
you see some of those standards in the

231
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,399
left side of the slide in the table and

232
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,399
that table is not comprehensive but

233
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,560
shows the most important ones

234
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,440
and also some traffic requirements which

235
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,399
you see in the right side of the slide

236
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,440
so essentially uh we're talking about um

237
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,080
you know just uh 802.1 cube

238
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,640
bridges with vlan uh

239
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
spanning tree if you want i don't think

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
anybody is deploying layer 2 broadcast

241
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
domains anymore but

242
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,519
you could potentially use that

243
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,040
if you need

244
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,440
at least three priority queues

245
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,519
with one being strict priority so strict

246
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,440
priority is mandatory because all of

247
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
these slippery frames need to be in a

248
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,839
strict priority queue

249
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,040
uh then synchronization uh we see

250
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,200
um 802

251
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
sorry 8275.1

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
uh telecom profile again we're going to

253
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,519
talk about that in the next section of

254
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,080
the presentation uh and also synchronous

255
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
ethernet so

256
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,279
again because

257
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,600
ec pre does not carry synchronization

258
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
that underlying infrastructure needs to

259
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,200
provide synchronization

260
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,120
and then uh you have in the bottom of

261
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,399
the table uh two um two standards that

262
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,959
you might not be familiar with so one is

263
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:57,839
uh

264
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,800
interspersing express um

265
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,560
uh traffic and also frame preemption

266
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
so what is that so that is

267
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,040
the ability for you in an ethernet

268
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,760
segment uh if you have if you are

269
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,399
transmitting a lower priority frame

270
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,519
and a higher priority frame arrives in

271
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,760
the queue you stop transmitting that

272
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,680
lower priority kit frame

273
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
transmit the higher priority frame and

274
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,079
then resume the lower priority frame so

275
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,240
the basic idea of frame creation is just

276
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,399
to reduce cheater

277
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,440
and uh there's two profiles with 802.1

278
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,160
cm one uh called profile a where you

279
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,240
don't use that and another called

280
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,200
profile b where you use that and the

281
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
the rule here is that if you're mixing

282
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
known front hall and front hall traffic

283
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,720
and the non-front hall traffic

284
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,920
has packet sizes larger larger than 2000

285
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,880
bytes then you need frame preemption to

286
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,959
maintain the jitter into acceptable

287
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,800
values

288
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
and then you see uh on the right uh the

289
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
different requirements in terms of delay

290
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,839
and packet loss uh uh for the uh typical

291
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,800
uh ec3 traffic that you see in terms of

292
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
user plan control and management playing

293
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,399
both fast and slow

294
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,279
so

295
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,079
now we have a set of guidelines

296
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,240
essentially with 802.1cm of how to

297
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,600
transfer that

298
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,959
um

299
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,519
that's that those signals from the radio

300
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,279
all the way to a centralized processing

301
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,519
unit over an internet

302
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,720
segment

303
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,959
but the reality is that

304
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,200
a lot of those sites if not all of the

305
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,959
sites today that have some sort of

306
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,959
centralized processing they are using

307
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,160
slippery

308
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,959
and no operator will simply upgrade the

309
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,200
entire infrastructure um because it's

310
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
not it's cost prohibitive and it would

311
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,680
take a lot of money just to replace all

312
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,079
of the deployed radios over there

313
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,040
so the reality in all of the deployments

314
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,959
where you have some centralized

315
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,880
processing is that you're going to have

316
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,760
to deal with slippery and esippery at

317
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,120
the same time

318
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,639
most of the times unless you're a

319
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,959
completely green field deployment

320
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,079
uh

321
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,839
most of the time when you use slippery

322
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,920
we're using some sort of wdm

323
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,120
multiplexing so so just essentially uh

324
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,200
light multiplexing

325
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,480
and uh

326
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,519
we can use that with slippery as well um

327
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,680
so that that is an option and there's

328
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,160
operators just taking advantage of new

329
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,399
uh wavelengths just to use the cypriot

330
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,160
that is completely valid

331
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,279
uh but what if we thought about a way to

332
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,320
use a native ethernet link

333
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,360
between those two sides um even with the

334
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,680
cypriot so that's what

335
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,079
the ieee worked on

336
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,959
and

337
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,000
with that a new standard was created

338
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,480
the 1914 radio over internet standard so

339
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,959
that establishes how

340
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,079
we can

341
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,279
transport sippy or encapsulate separate

342
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,600
over ethernet and in this case ethernet

343
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,079
we call ethernet tsn because we need all

344
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,440
of those prioritization and traffic

345
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,800
requirements matt in this case

346
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,279
so the basic concept here is to have an

347
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,760
roe mapper and a d mapper which will

348
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,160
convert cpr to ethernet and internet to

349
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,519
cpr on the other side uh you have the

350
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,839
ethernet encapsulation in the bottom of

351
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,320
the slide so you can see the either type

352
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,480
it's pretty simple uh just a plain

353
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,440
internet frame as we know it

354
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,600
and another important information is

355
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,760
that the mapper and the d-mapper needs

356
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
to be synchronized again

357
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,760
cpr carries uh the synchronous the

358
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
synchronization frames between the radio

359
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,360
the the rh

360
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,079
uh

361
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,959
and the bbu the baseband processing unit

362
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
so we need that time and phase

363
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,680
synchronization there

364
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,639
uh

365
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,360
so

366
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,279
again we're going to

367
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,880
talk about plenty of synchronization

368
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,800
concepts in the next slide

369
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,880
but now uh when we look at this node's

370
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,000
notes

371
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,600
transporting sippy over ethernet

372
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,120
simpry has a characteristic that

373
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,160
although it is a standard agreement the

374
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,279
actual implementations are proprietary

375
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,079
in terms of uh each radio vendor so you

376
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,880
cannot mix the bbu and the rrh between

377
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,959
two different vendors that's the reality

378
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,000
of 4g

379
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,959
uh in 5g the oran

380
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,079
working group 4 is working on specifying

381
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,920
that and other working groups as well is

382
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,800
uh working on specifying an open ecp

383
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,240
implementation where you can mix and

384
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,120
match

385
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
all of those different vendors but that

386
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
is not the reality in 4g

387
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
so there is some uh

388
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,639
there is some sort of proprietary uh uh

389
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,880
aspects when looking at slippery so

390
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,240
because of that

391
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,440
there are three different ways of uh

392
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
doing radio over here so the first way

393
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,680
is called structure agnostic to

394
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,760
tunneling mode sorry

395
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,399
so that means that we

396
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,800
just look at the layer one signal coming

397
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,160
into the mapper

398
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,680
we create a constant bitrate bit stream

399
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,360
and we just

400
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,680
do a demapping function in the other end

401
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,000
so essentially what comes in comes out

402
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,760
at a layer 1

403
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,240
level so we're not looking at any higher

404
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,079
layer protocols

405
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,199
this provides us the best level of

406
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,839
interoperability

407
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,399
and uh can use can be used with any

408
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,959
protocol essentially uh it is a constant

409
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,120
bit rate bit stream so

410
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,079
uh it provides the the highest bandwidth

411
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,240
consumption possible so that might not

412
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,680
be

413
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,240
desirable but in some circumstances that

414
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,800
might be the only option available

415
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,959
then we can go to the next

416
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,959
mapper on in the middle of the slide

417
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,240
which is the structure agnostic but line

418
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,600
coding aware

419
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,880
so blind coding aware mode uh what we do

420
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,639
is uh we remove

421
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,560
uh the um

422
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,360
the some of the line coding bits so um

423
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,759
cpr comes both in uh 8b 10b or 64b uh

424
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,360
66b

425
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
um in this case we would be left with

426
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,279
only the eight eight uh b or uh

427
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,759
64 bits um in this case so we will

428
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
remove some bits this provides us some

429
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,279
um

430
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,519
some savings in terms of bandwidth not a

431
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,000
lot uh an 8b10d a bit more than 64b66b

432
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,480
but because we're looking at frames here

433
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,600
we require a little bit of understanding

434
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,680
of higher layers and

435
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,399
again highly interoperable but with a

436
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,759
little bit of

437
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,240
bandwidth savings in this case

438
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,360
and

439
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,920
the third mode is structural wear so in

440
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,880
this case we need the full understanding

441
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,839
of the slippery protocol so what we're

442
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,519
going to have to do is

443
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,320
open up the separate protocol entirely

444
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,279
remove all of the unused bits

445
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,160
decompose the data flows control flows

446
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
and the timing synchronization flows of

447
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,280
cypri

448
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,119
uh and obviously because we're doing all

449
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,280
that decomposition and optimization it

450
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,599
saves us a whole lot more bandwidth but

451
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,760
again we can only do it if we fully

452
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
understand the cpr implementation so

453
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,959
this is a vendor specific

454
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,119
that is tied to the radio implementation

455
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,799
so you need to mix

456
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,280
you actually sorry need to match

457
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,840
that separate roe implementation with

458
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,760
the radio specific radio that we're

459
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,960
working with

460
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,760
so those are the three types of roe

461
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,600
mappers and with that

462
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,880
we can

463
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,600
use now a fully packet based

464
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,720
infrastructure to transport both the new

465
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,080
east separate

466
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,039
packets that come in the newer radius as

467
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,679
well as the cpu radios and create a

468
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,240
fully uh packet based infrastructure for

469
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,559
front hall so

470
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,880
centralized radio uh still as a

471
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,520
beginning of 2022 has not been so widely

472
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,679
deployed and uh many of the 5g

473
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,080
deployments have been relying on uh

474
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,240
distributed radio which means that that

475
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,080
is not decomposed so cu the u and r u

476
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,160
are uh deployed together there there are

477
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,760
a few deployments out there already

478
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,640
centralized and decomposing uh those

479
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,039
elements but moving forward there's a

480
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,000
lot of expectation uh that front hall is

481
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,559
going to be a very important technology

482
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,320
so uh roe

483
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,160
and ec3 become uh fundamental for that

484
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,799
okay so now let's look at uh another

485
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,120
fundamental capability for 5g transport

486
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,799
networks uh which is synchronization so

487
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,679
uh

488
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,679
why do we need synchronization first in

489
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,200
mobile networks

490
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,480
um

491
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,440
so

492
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,840
the basic uh principle of a mobile

493
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,919
network is that you need movement right

494
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,679
so you need to move from one place to

495
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,720
the other without losing connection

496
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,880
because you're using the same median a

497
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,440
shared median which is the air interface

498
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
of frequency in the air interface

499
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,760
between the different radios

500
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,000
we need we need those radios to be

501
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
synchronized

502
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,559
in order

503
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
for the network to provide the ability

504
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,280
for any given device

505
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,600
to move between one radio and the other

506
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
and finish transmission with a single

507
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,320
rate with a specific radio and resume

508
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,240
transmission and reception with another

509
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,960
radio without losing traffic so that is

510
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,799
why we need synchronization that was

511
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,840
that is why it's a fundamental um

512
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,559
capability you know we sometimes uh even

513
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,840
say that

514
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,760
synchronization in mobile networks is

515
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,559
just like um just like power if you lose

516
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,440
synchronization everybody's is isolated

517
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
essentially you don't have any more

518
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,240
movement

519
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,520
as radio features evolved uh some

520
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,240
capabilities such as care aggregation

521
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,799
which is the ability to

522
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,960
share two radios

523
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,559
or actually use two radius sharing to

524
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,000
the same

525
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,440
device

526
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,400
that capability puts even more strict

527
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,039
requirements into the synchronization

528
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,600
uh of those radios so they need to be

529
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,919
even more tightly synchronized in order

530
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,559
for uh the network to take advantage of

531
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,960
those capabilities so at the end it is

532
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,440
the radio capability or the radio

533
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,640
capabilities that are going to drive

534
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,159
the timing the synchronization

535
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,280
requirements

536
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
it's also important to note that there

537
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,840
are two types

538
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,799
of uh synchronization uh there and and

539
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,120
they highly depend on the type of

540
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,679
modulation that the radios use

541
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,919
um so if the radios use fdd which was

542
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
uh used uh a lot more in 4g that that

543
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,520
was the predominant uh type of

544
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,600
modulation for 4g

545
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,400
fdds frequency division to plaque so

546
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,080
essentially you're saying that you have

547
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,760
a specific frequency band for

548
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,000
transmitting and another frequency band

549
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,440
for reception

550
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,400
um

551
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
then you need frequency synchronization

552
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
and some of the technologies that

553
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,360
provide that is gnss or gps and there

554
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,280
are other types of constellation that

555
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,840
also provide the same capability

556
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,320
sonnet uh synchronizes in frequency

557
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,200
synchronous ethernet same thing and ptp

558
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
1588 also can synchronize frequency

559
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
uh there's another technology for

560
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,120
modulation which is time division duplex

561
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,720
which is tdd

562
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,600
in that case we don't have separate

563
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,760
frequency bands for transmitting and

564
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,360
receiving anymore

565
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,000
we have a single frequency frequency

566
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,640
band that is logically split into

567
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
reception and transmission

568
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
so for that

569
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,039
for that case we need time and phase

570
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,679
synchronization as well as frequency

571
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,919
uh just because we need to split that

572
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,120
same frequency band uh into transmission

573
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,480
and reception

574
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
and uh there are typically two

575
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,039
technologies used for that uh gps or

576
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,080
gnss or other constellations as well

577
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,840
and uh 1588 ptp those are the two

578
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,400
technologies used in this case

579
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,360
ttd becomes a lot more prevalent in 5g

580
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,760
because a lot of the frequency bands

581
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,799
determined for 5g use tdd so in that

582
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,840
case

583
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
we're going to see

584
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,200
a lot of discussion around time and

585
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,080
phase synchronization to enable 5g so

586
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,400
let's take a look at the basic network

587
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,799
timing distribution concepts and

588
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,799
before i talk about this i think i need

589
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,200
to be i need to make a disclaimer here

590
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,720
which is

591
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,760
the

592
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,880
ieee is still working on specifying uh

593
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
an inclusive nomenclature for um ieee

594
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,440
1588 so there's a par going on called

595
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,760
the p1588g

596
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,880
as if you're familiar with

597
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,400
1588 it uses a lot of terms a master and

598
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,360
slave

599
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,679
uh the final terms that are going to be

600
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,000
chosen are not yet defined

601
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,159
uh there is a proposal that might go

602
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,400
through which is time transmitter and

603
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,840
time receiver

604
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
so for the purpose of this presentation

605
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,679
i'll try to stick with transmitter and

606
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,400
receiver whenever i talk to transmitter

607
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
uh if you're if you don't know what that

608
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,240
means that is replacing the word master

609
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,880
and receiver would replace the word uh

610
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,919
slave

611
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,400
here you have essentially a protocol

612
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,240
which is defined by

613
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,159
by the ieee 1588 precision time protocol

614
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,039
and

615
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,600
it uses this transmitter and receiver

616
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,559
concept where one node sends timing to

617
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,600
another and then this uh next node is

618
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,520
gonna send to another one and so on and

619
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,320
so forth so there's a general protocol

620
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,520
specification but there's also

621
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,159
some profiles that establish how

622
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,559
that protocol

623
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,200
should be used in specific applications

624
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,919
and we have some telecom profiles which

625
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,480
as the name implies establish how those

626
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,400
profiles need to be used on a telecom

627
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
environment

628
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,400
the two main telecom profiles

629
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,640
are

630
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,760
g8275.1 and by the way

631
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,000
those profiles that are defined by the

632
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,039
itu not by the ieee so the itu-g8275.1

633
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,960
is for full timing support so that uh

634
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,760
sometimes we're going to see fts

635
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,039
as the acronym that means that all nodes

636
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,600
across the path must support timing

637
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,039
capabilities or must support ptp

638
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,080
it uses ethernet encapsulation so it's a

639
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,799
node to node ethernet encapsulation and

640
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,520
provides phase and time only uh

641
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,720
synchronization so uh for frequency

642
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,400
uh gad 275.1 typically uses synchronous

643
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
ethernet which is a

644
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,080
physical

645
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,919
technology so it's provided by the

646
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,480
underlying physical signals of the

647
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,240
ethernet

648
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,760
links between two elements

649
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,159
and then the other

650
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,799
profile is g8275.2

651
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,440
which is for partial timing support

652
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,159
so that means that only a few nodes in

653
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,120
the network are going to support timing

654
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,320
and you need to traverse a non-ptp aware

655
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,520
network

656
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,799
and

657
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,679
that

658
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,480
is why in this case we're using udp over

659
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,159
ip encapsulation because we need to

660
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,880
traverse non-ptp aware networks

661
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,400
and uh for g8275.2

662
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
it does provide frequency time and phase

663
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,640
synchronization so

664
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,520
we also have uh some common nomenclature

665
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
here so prtc

666
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,960
uh is a primary reference time clock so

667
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,960
it is typically a gnss receiver could be

668
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,720
other types of references but for the uh

669
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
for this presentation let's think about

670
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,360
a gnss uh receiver which is the most

671
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,840
used prtc type then we have the

672
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,360
grandmaster

673
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,600
and the grandmaster in this case

674
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,480
is

675
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,919
the one that provides timing uh for

676
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,520
that receives the time reference and

677
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,480
provides the ptp packets um looks like

678
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,880
the grand master term is not going to be

679
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,360
uh topic of this nomenclature uh

680
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,600
revision so we'll see how that looks

681
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,799
like

682
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,120
for now just uh they're typically

683
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,640
deployed together the grandmaster and

684
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,679
prtc so i'll just refer to them as time

685
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,520
references so i never say the time

686
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,320
reference uh i'm talking about uh

687
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,679
grandmaster plus a prtc so those are the

688
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,039
time references

689
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,559
and then you have this concept of

690
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,640
boundary clock where you get the ptp

691
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,360
messages uh on the reception side you

692
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,200
synchronize your internal clock and then

693
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,559
you transmit

694
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,919
um the ptp messages to the next uh

695
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,679
node and the path so that is the

696
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,640
boundary clock uh that that is essential

697
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
for us to provide the better accuracy

698
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,880
because it corrects uh for some error

699
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,400
we're gonna talk about error in the next

700
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
slide

701
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,279
at the end we have the receiving clock

702
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,679
so the ttsc

703
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,240
so it's the time receiver where you

704
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,159
essentially get the timing

705
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,159
signal and use

706
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,640
that time to synchronize your internal

707
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,880
systems uh there's also a transparent

708
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,840
clock which i'm not covering here um but

709
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,399
that is also a valid node it's not so

710
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,480
widely deployed as boundary clock so we

711
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,559
just stick with boundary clocks because

712
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,120
it provides better accuracy now whenever

713
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,600
you transmit timing through the network

714
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,000
we are

715
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,760
introducing error

716
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,039
and

717
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,240
itu has defined some limits

718
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,880
to the time error that each type of node

719
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,240
can introduce

720
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,799
uh in the network so you see for the

721
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,039
boundary clocks and the receivers in the

722
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,320
left

723
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,720
and you see for the time references uh

724
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,080
on the right

725
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,480
uh typically you have uh

726
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,399
on the boundary clock and receivers the

727
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,320
classes a b and c

728
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,120
uh with uh class c being the most

729
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,320
accurate

730
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,880
uh and here you can see there's some

731
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,919
specifications in terms of both constant

732
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,039
time error

733
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,039
as well as dynamic time error i didn't

734
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,960
put all of the um

735
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
requirements in this um

736
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,760
in this table just for conciseness uh

737
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,000
but please look at the standard the

738
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,080
g8273.2

739
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,880
so you can have all of the uh all of the

740
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,960
requirements for those nodes

741
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,000
uh and the same goes for um for the time

742
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,480
references on the right you can see um

743
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,960
there's different types of references

744
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,480
prtca

745
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,240
prtcb and eprtc

746
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,720
with different accuracies what is

747
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,559
important to note is that is not only

748
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,480
the nodes themselves that add

749
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,960
error that add time error but

750
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,679
there's also other sources such as for

751
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,480
instance uh length of symmetry so

752
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,919
if you have for instance in the link

753
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,039
different

754
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,600
lengths of fiber in the transmit and

755
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,200
receive of

756
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,880
fibers

757
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,520
that is going to add some some time

758
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,480
error

759
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,720
because of link asymmetry and

760
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
that is sometimes more common that it

761
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,640
might look like

762
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,399
another uh source of time error is

763
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,559
temperature variation so

764
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,440
um

765
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,039
the temperature

766
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,799
because we're dealing with uh things

767
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,000
like uh

768
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,399
crystals and oscillators and and

769
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,799
components electrical components as the

770
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,360
temperature varies uh they might affect

771
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,640
the accuracy uh and the time error added

772
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,720
by each element in the network and the

773
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,120
components themselves are also some uh

774
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,320
source of variation so even using very

775
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,720
strict taller tolerances for the

776
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,919
components

777
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,480
sometimes when you're running tests uh

778
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,640
you run a test you switch off or power

779
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,120
cycle the node and switch it on again

780
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,360
and run the same test

781
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,200
and you're going to see a slight

782
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
difference there and

783
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,080
this is happening here a timing is an

784
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,679
area where

785
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,399
because of all of those variations

786
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,120
you typically want to have a very

787
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,320
tight hardware and software development

788
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,720
because the same code for different

789
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,960
hybrid implementations needs to be tuned

790
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,559
specifically for

791
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,720
having better accuracy on that specific

792
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,039
hardware implementation or sometimes you

793
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,720
need to tune a little bit the hardware

794
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,799
for that code to work well so it goes

795
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,240
both ways and it's a very sensitive area

796
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,520
in terms of

797
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,000
of future development for

798
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,279
any vendor

799
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,360
in the industry

800
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
so those are the time error

801
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,000
and again when we're

802
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,520
transmitting

803
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,039
synchronization timing throughout the

804
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,679
network we're going to add error so

805
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,039
how much error is acceptable for 5g

806
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,799
so here we have

807
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,679
a

808
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,919
diagram that shows the different

809
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,679
requirements we'll start with the right

810
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,919
side of the slide which shows the basic

811
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,440
requirement for

812
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,840
uh 3 000 nanoseconds so that is the

813
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,559
basic requirement from 3gpp

814
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,760
where you need to um

815
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,799
have 3000 nanoseconds between any two

816
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,840
radios

817
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,720
uh in order to enable uh the handoff uh

818
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,440
between the two radios so that is the

819
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,679
maximum admissible

820
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,519
time error difference between any two

821
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,080
radios in a mobile network

822
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,559
with that uh we create

823
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,799
essentially three categories

824
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,679
of timing accuracy requirements so

825
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,440
i'll start from the bottom of the table

826
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,240
on the left and that's category c

827
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,840
and we here have the value of uh fifteen

828
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,519
hundred nanoseconds a thousand five

829
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,679
hundred nanoseconds sometimes we see one

830
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,840
point five microseconds as well

831
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,360
obviously the same thing

832
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,440
so um

833
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,080
1500 nanoseconds comes from the fact

834
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,640
that if you have 3000 between any two

835
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
radios

836
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,519
between the antenna the radio

837
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,559
one and the time reference

838
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,919
you're gonna need uh 1500 so you can

839
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,120
have 1500 from reference to radio 1 and

840
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,679
1500 from reference to radio 2. that's

841
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,240
where the 1500 nanoseconds number comes

842
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,039
from

843
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,360
so that is category c you see some of

844
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,399
the radio features so the basic 5g tdd

845
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,679
requirement just needs this absolute

846
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,679
number absolute meaning

847
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,760
from the radio antenna all the way to

848
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,440
the time reference

849
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,519
now when we start looking at more

850
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,480
advanced functionalities in the radio we

851
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,600
have two other categories and those

852
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,120
again are needed when we are looking at

853
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,000
any two given radios talking to a single

854
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,120
device uh at the same time so we are

855
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,399
actually sharing uh those two radios uh

856
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,120
to send and receive signals

857
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,080
uh to uh uh one device so that is for

858
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,120
carrier aggregation uh typically uh

859
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,080
could be infraband or interbend uh and

860
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,679
then we have category b which is uh 206

861
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,120
uh 216 nanoseconds uh

862
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,880
category b

863
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,519
is typically used in intra site but

864
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,960
could also be used intersight

865
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,120
because it's a little bit less stringent

866
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,360
than category a

867
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,720
which is 130 nanoseconds so that

868
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,039
is typically only used

869
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,440
intra site so in the same cell site in

870
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,679
the same location two radios that are

871
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,240
physically located together now because

872
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,279
we're talking about those two radios

873
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,519
in this case that

874
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,200
these numbers 260 and 130 are not

875
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
absolute meaning that they are not

876
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,919
between the radio and the time reference

877
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,720
but rather they are between

878
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,599
two antennas of two different radios

879
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,520
that are being that are serving a single

880
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,000
device right so that is a very important

881
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,800
distinction to have here category c has

882
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,239
an absolute

883
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,480
time error requirement from the antenna

884
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,159
all the way to the time reference

885
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,440
categories a and b have a relative

886
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,280
time error of reference uh or

887
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,918
requirement between two any two given

888
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,199
ratings so that that is how we look at

889
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,199
the maximum time error

890
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,679
now how can we budget

891
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,960
for that time error so

892
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,399
this next slide is directly taken from

893
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,000
itu g8275.71

894
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,599
sorry.1

895
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,800
uh which shows the performance for

896
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,480
in this case full timing support fts

897
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,880
uh and this is the case for backhaul

898
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,240
only yeah we're going to talk about

899
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,200
front hall in a second

900
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,400
so in this slide you can see uh appear

901
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,880
to see a time reference

902
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,079
that will give you a hundred nanoseconds

903
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,040
then you have some dynamic time error

904
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,200
then you have some constant time error

905
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,079
and you have something left for the time

906
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,640
error of lengths

907
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,240
in blue you can have

908
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,599
boundary clocks

909
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,720
class a

910
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,800
and in green you can have the boundary

911
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
clocks class b

912
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,960
so you can see that class b boundary

913
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,599
clocks give you more hops

914
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,680
than the class a boundary clocks and

915
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,520
that's the effect of those different

916
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,160
classes of boundary clocks the more

917
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,280
accurate

918
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,079
uh your boundary clock is the more hops

919
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,839
you are able to traverse

920
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,079
without uh

921
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,560
without going over the budget

922
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,800
and in this case you can see that

923
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,000
there's uh 1100 nanoseconds all the way

924
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,960
from the reference to the radio

925
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,440
because the radio is considering some

926
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,480
budget for uh short-term holdover which

927
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,560
means if the radio loses synchronization

928
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,119
with its reference uh it can just select

929
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,720
another reference and that will include

930
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,839
the time error so that is um the 215

931
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,160
nanoseconds in red

932
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,240
you see here on the right side

933
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,640
and then you have 150 nanoseconds for

934
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,160
the radio itself so that's how you come

935
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,640
from 1500 end to end from the antenna uh

936
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,760
to the time reference to 1100 that you

937
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,160
see many times in collaterals in the

938
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,440
network so that's how it's calculated

939
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,200
there's actually some formulas in the

940
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,880
standard that allow you to calculate

941
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,320
that very well i'm not going to go

942
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,680
through that it's outside of the scope

943
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,200
of this presentation

944
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,920
but there is a mathematical way of

945
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,680
calculating those those those budgets

946
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,240
now the bottom part of the slide has a

947
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,880
different scenario in this case

948
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,680
we don't have that 250 nanoseconds and

949
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,720
the radio anymore allocated

950
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,760
for holdovers or for reselection

951
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,640
we

952
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,520
transfer that reselection budget now to

953
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,920
the boundary clock so it means that a

954
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,760
given boundary clock will lose its

955
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,359
reference and we'll select another

956
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,440
reference as a backup

957
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,920
and then you have um

958
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,560
that very large budget for that of uh

959
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,839
six uh 620 nanoseconds

960
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,000
uh you still have the dynamic time

961
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,320
errors you have the constant timer you

962
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,119
can see the class c boundary clocks

963
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,520
introduce a much less time error so you

964
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,160
can potentially have a lot more pops

965
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,240
of boundary clocks in this case and then

966
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,520
you also have

967
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,400
the time error for the links so in this

968
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,119
case because we don't have that 250

969
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,520
nanoseconds for the radio

970
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,560
the

971
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,599
network budget ends up being

972
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,079
1350 nanoseconds so

973
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,160
that's why it's important to understand

974
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,880
how these budgets are calculated because

975
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,839
the real number here is 1500 between the

976
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,079
time reference and the antenna whatever

977
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,400
is in the middle highly depends

978
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,720
uh of the types of nodes that you're

979
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,960
using and their specific characteristics

980
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,040
so you need to understand that and

981
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,680
calculate uh the limits for a specific

982
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,520
network application

983
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,320
uh so how does a deployment look like in

984
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,480
this case for backhaul

985
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,280
so the most typical deployment uh is to

986
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,760
have uh what we call a sell side router

987
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,280
which is a router that goes in the cell

988
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,839
side connected to the gps so it becomes

989
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,320
a time reference for those radios and

990
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,240
those radios are typically directly

991
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,680
connected uh to the cellset router

992
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,200
i'll just mention that the south side

993
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,680
router is an industry term uh that is

994
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,000
highly used but then when you're

995
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,560
starting to use centralized radios uh

996
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,599
where

997
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,160
you might have the cu

998
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,359
all the way

999
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,440
into the network in a more centralized

1000
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,720
location uh that first hop router is not

1001
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,400
going to be inside the south side uh

1002
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
anymore so it's going to be in maybe an

1003
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,160
aggregation site so

1004
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,720
uh in centralized ram locations uh

1005
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,560
southside router might the south side

1006
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,320
route return might not make a lot of

1007
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,400
sense but anyway i'll stick to south

1008
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,320
side router here every time i i'll say

1009
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,400
southside router it is the first hop

1010
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,520
router

1011
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,599
uh so in this case because they're

1012
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,320
directly connected uh the time error

1013
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,240
introduced here is essentially that of

1014
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,880
the the time reference the prtc

1015
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,480
uh and uh also all the links and and

1016
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,079
then obviously you always have the time

1017
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,320
error introduced by the radio so

1018
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,119
it is very likely that you're still okay

1019
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,720
in using uh enter site uh category b if

1020
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,960
you need it uh because all the sites are

1021
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,760
gonna be referenced with that gps

1022
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,960
now if you want some backup uh what if

1023
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,800
that gps fails and yes the gps does fail

1024
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,680
uh so it could be maybe jammed there's

1025
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,280
ways to try and prevent that a little

1026
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,520
bit but it could be jammed

1027
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,920
or uh if you don't have a good antenna

1028
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,680
positioning for the gps and that

1029
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,640
typically happens in urban canyons i

1030
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,520
think new york city for instance or

1031
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,599
anytime you were driving in a very high

1032
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,280
building type of street in downtown

1033
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
you probably lost gps in your car and

1034
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,440
that happens the same thing uh with the

1035
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,400
gps for the router uh so if you're if

1036
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,200
you don't have good visibility for

1037
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,359
the satellites you might lose gps from

1038
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,520
time to time so if you lose that

1039
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,319
you need a backup and in this case if

1040
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,000
you want the fiber infrastructure and

1041
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,839
you're able to provide

1042
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:44,880
uh

1043
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,119
full timing support all the way to a

1044
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,160
backup centralized time reference you

1045
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,880
could essentially just uh switch to that

1046
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,520
more centralized location in case uh the

1047
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,359
gps fails depending on the path you have

1048
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,480
from that south side to your centralized

1049
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,040
location you might or might not might

1050
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,400
not be okay

1051
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,280
for uh inter-site uh category b so it

1052
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,599
depends on the radio features again you

1053
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,640
need to dimension uh this path according

1054
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,560
to the radio requirements in terms of

1055
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,880
time error but this is typically how you

1056
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,920
do

1057
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
in the case you want that fiber

1058
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,760
infrastructure and you're able to do

1059
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,440
full timing support

1060
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,560
to a

1061
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,480
backup time reference

1062
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,680
now what happens in case you don't own

1063
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,480
that fiber infrastructure and you still

1064
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,880
want to provide some sort of redundancy

1065
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,720
for your gps

1066
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,240
so in this case

1067
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,520
because

1068
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,880
you don't have a ptp aware network and

1069
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,760
many times those are ethernet circuits

1070
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,640
with

1071
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,960
all all types of companies and i'm sure

1072
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
there are some people in the audience

1073
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,280
here that even are part of these

1074
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,000
companies that provide connectivity uh

1075
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,119
to those mobile operators

1076
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,440
you will need

1077
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,000
a new in this case uh the model operator

1078
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,880
will need to operate into pts mode

1079
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,200
partial timing support mode

1080
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,880
right so in this case

1081
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,720
there's going to be an ethernet circuit

1082
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,440
connecting an aggregation site

1083
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,520
to a cell site

1084
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,040
and uh

1085
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,000
you have a gps in the cell side but then

1086
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,480
you have this pts this partial timing

1087
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,119
support connection all the way back

1088
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,280
to your time reference

1089
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,240
so

1090
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,200
what we do in this case uh is

1091
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,680
we actually use a

1092
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,319
slightly different uh standard which is

1093
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,520
called apts and the a comes from

1094
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,560
assistant so assisted pts

1095
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,760
means that the gps that is in the cell

1096
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,960
side

1097
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,240
uh will adjust the time error

1098
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,680
uh that is in the uh that comes from the

1099
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,960
pts network so in that case the pts

1100
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
network will introduce a lot more time

1101
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,160
error because

1102
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,640
um those nodes are not

1103
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,400
ptp aware

1104
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,960
so the gps will provide a very stable

1105
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,839
reference the router will correct that

1106
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,480
time error and in case

1107
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,760
the gps goes away it can send a more

1108
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,079
accurate signal to the ram

1109
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,440
now if

1110
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,920
the network in the back the ethernet

1111
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,560
circuit has a traffic spy core has

1112
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,280
buffering problems or has reroutes

1113
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,160
or

1114
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,079
the number of hop changes because of uh

1115
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,440
reroutes

1116
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,680
that uh reference that the router

1117
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,800
established with the the gps is not

1118
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,680
valid anymore and that is going to be um

1119
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,000
that is going to be a have an effect

1120
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,240
into the signal the timing signal that

1121
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,599
goes to the ram

1122
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,280
so important to say that apts is a

1123
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,119
g8275.2 standard if you don't want to

1124
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,960
use g8275.2

1125
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,040
in the radio you need some interworking

1126
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,200
function in that router to convert

1127
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,800
g8275.2 to g857 8275 8275.1

1128
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,319
quickly talking about front hall

1129
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,160
synchronization so there's four

1130
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,839
different topologies that all rams

1131
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,359
specified configuration one has uh the

1132
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,280
time referencing the du connected

1133
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,200
directly to the to the ru um

1134
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,560
the configuration 2 has some boundary

1135
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,160
clocks in the middle between the d and

1136
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,280
the ru

1137
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,680
configuration 3 has the timing reference

1138
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,400
between the du and the ru

1139
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,160
and the configuration four has um uh

1140
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,640
independent time references between the

1141
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,800
uh du and the ru

1142
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,280
so if we look in more details how that

1143
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,680
looks like in terms of budget you see

1144
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,280
that this is no different you still have

1145
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,680
the 1500 nanoseconds all the way from

1146
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,480
the antenna to the time reference

1147
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,680
so uh what we need to be aware here is

1148
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,560
that

1149
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,200
if we are doing some inter radio

1150
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,280
features like carrier aggregation or in

1151
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,920
other words category b or c

1152
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,800
because those references are going to be

1153
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,119
between any given two radius we always

1154
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,920
need to look at the last common boundary

1155
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,640
clock so if we look at the two are using

1156
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,960
the top the last common boundary clock

1157
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,200
is the one inside the side so that is

1158
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,720
going to be fine because they're locally

1159
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,839
connected

1160
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,800
but if we look at uh radius from the

1161
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,040
side and the bottom to the side in the

1162
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,599
top like between those two sites

1163
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,359
the last common boundary clock is going

1164
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,880
to be the one in the hub side and then

1165
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,000
we now now need to see if that budget is

1166
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,560
okay for inter-site uh for that

1167
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,640
inter-site capability so here you have

1168
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,760
some

1169
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,599
formulas and

1170
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,000
to show you the way you think about that

1171
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,079
uh and last uh for front hull um in in

1172
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,720
the c3 deployment uh the main point of

1173
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,960
this slide is to show that the real

1174
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,560
requirement for front hall is to

1175
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
synchronize the rus and not necessarily

1176
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,160
the du

1177
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,280
uh the du has a more loose

1178
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,440
synchronization requirement we typically

1179
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,319
say it also needs 1500 nanoseconds

1180
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,480
so this means that you need to be

1181
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,400
concerned with the synchronization

1182
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,800
between any given to our use and from

1183
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,880
the iu to the time reference so that

1184
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,760
means if you have to choose a location

1185
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,480
to put your time reference that probably

1186
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,160
should be closer uh to the ru's than to

1187
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,960
the deus the du is is a lot looser it's

1188
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,359
not so strict in its synchronization

1189
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,680
requirements so into the last section of

1190
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,560
the presentation uh 5g network slicing

1191
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,560
it's probably one of the most talked

1192
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,480
about capabilities

1193
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,599
uh and let's take a look at uh

1194
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,000
5g network slicing and what it means

1195
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,160
what it means for everyone so first

1196
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,119
let's define what is network uh slicing

1197
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,800
in 5g and i try to put it into some uh

1198
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,280
well-known words and my definition is

1199
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,160
that

1200
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,560
it is a network controlled as a lay-back

1201
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,480
clientless vpn

1202
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,560
so let me go through that it's network

1203
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,440
control because the operator controls

1204
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,359
that vpn so the

1205
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,160
operator needs to provision the slices

1206
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,640
in all elements of the network including

1207
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,960
the devices themselves

1208
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,079
and

1209
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,000
it will operate and needs to create

1210
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,240
those slices before you can even use it

1211
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,280
so it is network control it will control

1212
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,640
who uses what and where

1213
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,720
uh it is sla backed because every node

1214
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,400
in the network and you can take a look

1215
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,920
at the different roles they have here in

1216
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,880
the slide every node is able to apply

1217
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,599
quas quality of service and prioritize

1218
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,720
traffic from each slice accordingly or

1219
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,960
according to any sla that it needs to

1220
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,480
use in terms of

1221
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,440
bandwidth uh latency queueing anything

1222
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,119
that you might think about

1223
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,520
this is the biggest actually difference

1224
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,079
uh of network slicing uh when compared

1225
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,520
to some uh

1226
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,000
similar technologies such as apn that we

1227
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,400
had in 4g uh it is clientless uh because

1228
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
it's a native capability so every 5g

1229
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,920
device already uses uh um

1230
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,040
slicing so it is enabled by default even

1231
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
if you're not selecting any slice you're

1232
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,200
selecting this the default slice which

1233
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,680
will typically be internet traffic

1234
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,079
it's not something that you enable later

1235
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,440
so every

1236
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,920
5g connection has a slice associated to

1237
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,160
it so there's nothing needed to install

1238
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,119
there

1239
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,200
and vpn because it gives us the same

1240
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,280
feeling of being connected to a vpn it

1241
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,280
is a virtual instance a logical instance

1242
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,760
on top of the network including separate

1243
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,800
routing context that means that you have

1244
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,880
separate completely separate ip

1245
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,160
addressing

1246
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,839
and completely separate traffic

1247
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,040
isolation

1248
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,359
and here you can see all of the nodes in

1249
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,640
the network

1250
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,800
and some of their roles in network

1251
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,559
slicing

1252
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,040
so if you're using network slicing

1253
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,680
uh let's take a look at a specific use

1254
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,760
case and this would be an enterprise

1255
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,920
application enterprise zap application

1256
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,800
maybe

1257
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,079
uh it's a some sort of uh control lab or

1258
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,800
maybe it couldn't be even you know

1259
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,880
protected email or whatever application

1260
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,319
you want to think about

1261
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,760
so in this case instead of installing a

1262
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,119
a vpn client for instance to use that

1263
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,520
the enterprise could go and talk to an

1264
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,079
operator and say hey for this specific

1265
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,359
application

1266
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,720
in my employees devices i need you to

1267
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,119
protect that traffic and route that

1268
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,240
directly to my internal network and not

1269
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,920
have it have any connection to the

1270
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,480
internet or any other network

1271
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,960
so the first um

1272
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,720
the first requirement here is obviously

1273
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,680
that agreement between the enterprise

1274
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,079
and the operator to establish so that

1275
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,400
the operator can establish the the

1276
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,160
slicing

1277
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,400
infrastructure and provision all of that

1278
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,079
into the network

1279
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,800
uh then the enterprise and here in the

1280
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
slice i'll just mention that i'm

1281
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,800
showing the android specific

1282
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,319
implementation you have a link in the

1283
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,760
bottom of

1284
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,599
the slide that has a little bit more

1285
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,160
details on how android implements this

1286
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,480
uh so you need to enable slicing through

1287
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,400
mdm to device management so the

1288
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,000
enterprise will

1289
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,240
tell the device hey you need to use

1290
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,760
slicing

1291
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,240
and then the network uh

1292
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,040
operator will send a message

1293
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,599
to each device uh this message uh has

1294
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,240
a slicing selection configuration in a

1295
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,960
message called ursp so ue route

1296
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,880
selection policy

1297
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,040
this message comes from a node inside

1298
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,319
the operator called the pcf

1299
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,640
it's the policy control function it

1300
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,440
flows to the control plane element which

1301
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,160
is called uh amf access and mobility

1302
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,559
function those are all 5g control plane

1303
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,440
elements so the the operator needs to

1304
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,160
configure all of those devices to

1305
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,720
uh to send this message and you have an

1306
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,119
example in the left what that message

1307
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,839
looks like uh obviously a simplified uh

1308
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,240
a simplified uh example

1309
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,880
uh but once the um

1310
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,359
once the device receives that message

1311
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,040
what it's going to do is it's going to

1312
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,160
say oh okay for the app app x

1313
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,520
uh i need to use slice uh enterprise and

1314
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,119
the slice id is this one uh sst

1315
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,880
1 sd2 so that is just how slices are our

1316
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,800
configured the id

1317
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,119
inside the 5g core

1318
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,359
so in this case it knows that it needs

1319
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,760
to connect to the specific enterprise

1320
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,480
slice it will receive a specific ip

1321
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,240
address it will create a specific

1322
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,319
routing instance and connect that app

1323
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,319
only to that routing instance which is a

1324
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,720
private network in essence this is just

1325
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,959
like an evpn but you don't need to

1326
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,440
install or deploy any vpn client here

1327
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,680
because it's native to 5g

1328
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,119
with the added ability of the 5g

1329
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,079
operator being able to provide an sla

1330
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,960
for this specific vpn

1331
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,880
now if you're a network

1332
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,800
builder if you're a mobile operator what

1333
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,960
does it mean to you well it's just

1334
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,800
another type of network virtualization

1335
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,520
we have been doing virtualization in ip

1336
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,240
networks and internet networks forever

1337
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,040
uh

1338
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,400
so

1339
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,200
what is each uh slice it's just another

1340
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,480
vpn it's a layer 3 vpn so the radio is

1341
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,640
going to use different ip addresses one

1342
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,240
for each slice

1343
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,640
and it's important to note that if you

1344
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,480
take a packet from the network if you

1345
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,559
capture a packet

1346
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,520
you can't tell you cannot tell

1347
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,280
which slice it belongs to it doesn't

1348
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,359
have any slice identifier

1349
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,680
so you need a service delimiter in the

1350
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,760
radio to tell the first hop router the

1351
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,400
southside router or the p the first pe

1352
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,000
uh which

1353
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
slice those packets belong to and in

1354
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,119
this case

1355
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,520
uh vlans are the service delimiters here

1356
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,359
so essentially the radio is going to

1357
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,480
deliver each slice in a dedicated vlan

1358
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,400
so if provision another slice you're

1359
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,480
going to get another vlan and those

1360
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,200
vlans are going to be mapped to vrfs and

1361
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,280
this in this case in the first hop

1362
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,319
router

1363
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,599
um

1364
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,359
you can see here there's a blue and red

1365
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,160
vlan and their gtp tunnel it's important

1366
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,680
to know that the traffic from the

1367
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,640
devices are always tunneled

1368
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,440
uh and this is uh poses an interesting

1369
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,960
point which is

1370
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,119
the radio could also potentially use a

1371
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,200
single yp address for all slices and

1372
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,119
still have traffic separation because

1373
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,880
the gtp tunnel

1374
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,480
um separates the device traffic from the

1375
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,319
infrastructure traffic

1376
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,440
the only caveat is that if we own if you

1377
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,040
only use the single ip address in the

1378
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,680
radio we cannot have traffic separation

1379
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,359
uh all slices are going to be treated

1380
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,520
just like one but we still have

1381
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,359
uh and i mean traffic separation in the

1382
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,480
infrastructure and different uh quas

1383
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,559
but uh there's still gonna be traffic

1384
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,079
separation between all the different

1385
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,480
vpns you're never going to mix and match

1386
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,400
uh regardless if you use different ips

1387
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,880
in the radio or only a single ip

1388
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,040
so obviously uh if you want to provide

1389
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,200
different cause and different priorities

1390
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,960
and so on and so forth you want to

1391
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,040
separate that into different vlans and

1392
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,200
again you go into uh different vrfs now

1393
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,359
in the core uh the most used technology

1394
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,680
here is uh mpls you could also use

1395
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,680
segment routing mpls

1396
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,280
there's lots of discussion and some

1397
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,760
operators looking at srv6 you could use

1398
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,920
traffic engineering embedded into the

1399
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,839
network you could use

1400
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,440
you know centralized

1401
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,839
controller for traffic engineering here

1402
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,040
is just you know pick your favorite tool

1403
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,559
that you like to use

1404
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,720
and apply the policies that you need to

1405
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,599
to make it happen

1406
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:58,400
uh

1407
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,400
and what about control plane same

1408
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,079
concept control plane is just another

1409
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,359
vrf

1410
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,839
and it's gonna separate be separated you

1411
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,520
also have management plane which i

1412
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,160
didn't put here which is you know it yet

1413
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,520
another vrf

1414
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,200
uh the only different case which i

1415
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,400
wanted to show in this slide is

1416
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,400
synchronization so synchronization as we

1417
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,559
saw before um

1418
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,200
in case we're using g8275.1

1419
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,119
full timing support we use ethernet

1420
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,880
encapsulation so the synchronization

1421
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,440
packets are going to come untagged so

1422
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,359
you need to make sure that uh you know

1423
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,680
you you can pass and tag packets here if

1424
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,000
there's any uh devices in between the

1425
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,400
radio and this first hop router because

1426
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,079
those that's how the synchronization is

1427
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,599
going to be

1428
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,240
transmitted

1429
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,880
uh so another important point here is

1430
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,240
that

1431
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,960
the network typically connects the 5g

1432
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,599
net radio network typically connects to

1433
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,359
a 5g core

1434
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,599
that is typically deployed in a data

1435
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,400
center be that a private data center

1436
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,720
or a public data center

1437
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,880
so when we look at the data center

1438
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,720
probably the most typical uh protocol

1439
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,119
used there is vxlan so in this case

1440
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,559
we're going to have some sort of data

1441
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,040
center inter connection here node border

1442
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,319
leaf

1443
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,079
whatever you want to call it that has

1444
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,400
the vr apps and map those vr apps to vx

1445
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,359
lens inside the data center fabric

1446
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,000
it could vary doesn't need to be vx lens

1447
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,760
in fact if you go maybe to a public

1448
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,319
cloud could be something different

1449
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,640
but most of the cores if not all of the

1450
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,440
5g cores are starting to be deployed

1451
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,000
in the form of cloud native applications

1452
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,440
in kubernetes so here is just a typical

1453
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,440
data center design where you have ip

1454
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,319
traffic coming into a kubernetes cluster

1455
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,000
pick your own tools as you as you prefer

1456
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,400
uh doesn't need to be vxlan it's just an

1457
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
option that i'm showing here as an idea

1458
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,920
of how you would do that in the data

1459
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,040
center border

1460
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,079
and just a quick slide on the end-to-end

1461
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,599
architecture so we have all of the

1462
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,599
encapsulations here from all the way in

1463
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,920
the left from the radio to the poor

1464
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,960
um

1465
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,920
you have evpn's you have ipvpns for

1466
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,960
layer 3 vpns bgp rmp bgp being the

1467
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,200
control protocol end to end makes it

1468
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,119
easier to provision end-to-end could be

1469
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,359
segment routing or maybe segment routing

1470
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:21,440
v6 uh as well here uh many options again

1471
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,559
pick and choose your favorite

1472
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,280
technologies uh it doesn't 5g doesn't

1473
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,359
dictate what you need to use

1474
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,799
um and

1475
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,440
it's just a you know an ip network would

1476
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,400
cost

1477
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,520
and uh layer 3 vpn's essentially so

1478
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,200
we've been building

1479
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,040
those networks forever so it's just

1480
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,799
another case

1481
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:41,680
and

1482
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,000
last topic last but not least quas very

1483
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,520
important i've been talking about hey

1484
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,799
you can provide an sla so how does that

1485
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,160
sla work in this case 5g is a little bit

1486
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,200
better than 4g because 4g only allowed

1487
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,920
us

1488
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,240
to prioritize the gtp tunnel so every

1489
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,480
flow inside that tunnel uh regardless if

1490
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,440
it's

1491
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,680
you know netflix or facebook or whatsapp

1492
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,440
or whatever application you're using

1493
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,480
they all get the same priority in 5g we

1494
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,160
can differentiate all of that and the

1495
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,640
radio will mark the dscp

1496
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,040
for all of these different flows so in

1497
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,240
this case we can take the router and

1498
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,319
apply different classification based

1499
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,799
criteria based on the scp and apply

1500
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,640
different cost policies so it makes our

1501
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,079
lives easier when doing prioritization

1502
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,480
so if we look at the end how that looks

1503
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,680
like from a router perspective you're

1504
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,720
going to have

1505
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,440
all the slices all the vlans

1506
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,640
where we apply uh hierarchical costs so

1507
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,880
hierarchical queuing with all of the

1508
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,040
high medium low in this case priority

1509
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,480
traffic coming into the different vlans

1510
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,640
they're going to be coming mark with the

1511
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,000
dscp

1512
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,760
then what we're going to do is uh we're

1513
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,839
going to mark those packets in this case

1514
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,559
for mpls we're going to mark the mplstc

1515
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,599
field and have flat queuing in the core

1516
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:02,319
so

1517
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:06,400
essentially uh ip quasar 101 again no

1518
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,960
different than any uh layer 3 vpn type

1519
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,280
of uh infrastructure that we've been

1520
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,079
building forever uh so slicing will just

1521
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,480
make use of those technologies that have

1522
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,400
been highly effective

1523
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,799
up to today all right so that concludes

1524
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,799
the presentation it's a lot of material

1525
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,559
i realize um so um i hope

1526
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,040

1527
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,480
