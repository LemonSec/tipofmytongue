1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
[Music]

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,560
at this time i'd like to move on to our

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,720
presentations i would like to introduce

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,400
peter landon who are presenting 400 zr

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,599
zr plus management and automation

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,279
peter is a director of product line

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,720
management for the nokia network

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,119
services platform this is peter's third

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,439
time presenting at nanog peter's first

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,359
talk in anag was called why operators

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,160
need transport sdn not just another sdn

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,960
presentation at nanox 63 in san antonio

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
2015.

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,239
welcome back to nano peter we're very

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,519
happy to have you back with us today

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,559
all right thanks kat

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,280
yeah 2015 i actually remember that uh

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,960
presentation

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,039
and i think uh phil did a great job on

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,520
monday uh describing

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,960
how far things have come with sdn or not

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
um but what i want to talk about today

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,680
is uh 400 er management through

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,039
automation

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,359
now i'm from canada so

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,239
i

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,760
say zr

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,439
but being in texas we're going to go

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,680
with zr today but if i go back and forth

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,840
please you know bear with me on that

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,200
okay so the first thing we're going to

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,080
cover is uh the coherent landscape it's

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,560
just an overview of where 400 set our is

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,360
today and what the technology is capable

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,400
of uh what it's not capable of

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
and then we're going to look at managing

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,400
coherent optical and there's some

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,920
special considerations that you want to

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,840
keep in mind with that and then we'll

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
touch on why you should consider

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,400
automating your ip optical

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,439
network

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,000
and then we'll go through a couple of

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,560
use cases

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,640
but what i want you to take away from

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,840
the discussion today really is that

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
if you're looking at

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
putting deploying 400 zr in your network

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,240
there's really no one-size-fits-all

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
management

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,079
approach depending on how much

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,000
integration you want with brownfield

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,840
network or with a greenfield new deploy

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,878
you know your

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,639
network automation has to be flexible

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,400
enough to be able to handle both of

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
those

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,599
scenarios

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,280
okay so

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,040
the landscape maybe

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,120
show a hands in

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
who's looking at 400 zr possibly

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
deploying in the future or just maybe

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,920
interested in it okay

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,680
yeah i i think

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,760
um you've maybe read about some of the

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
promises that are being uh put out there

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,800
for cr and and

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,480
and wanting to learn more about it and

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,080
so what we'll do is is start with

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,599
where it came from

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,800
and uh

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,040
and the motivation behind it so

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,200
right around 2017 at the oif there was a

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,120
project started

76
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,080
called 400 zr and it was uh it had a

77
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
central goal of reducing the cost of

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,959
data center interconnect

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,920
and

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,120
the way that

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,760
it was going to be done was by

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
moving the coherent transponding

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
functions into the router

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,800
now this is not new there's been

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
coherent optics

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,599
for years

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,159
but you can see from the from the chart

88
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,599
tracking the

89
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,000
size of the coherent optics

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
versus the client

91
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,640
has never been in parity so what happens

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,040
when you deploy or if you introduce a

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,599
coherent optic that is larger in form

94
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,400
factor

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
you end up with an inefficient face

96
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
plate and you really end up stranding

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,400
bandwidth

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,239
so until you get to the point where the

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,959
client optic and the coherent optic are

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,280
in the same form factor it's not gonna

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
it's not gonna really uh take off

102
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,319
so with that in mind uh the group um

103
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,040
targeted uh a next generation dsp a

104
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,599
technology note 7 nanometer and at the

105
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,159
time the estimates were that you could

106
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,959
fit

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,599
uh within that technology envelope the

108
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,840
power that was required to be uh for for

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,159
the qsf pdd

110
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,879
and so between that and and really

111
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,400
fiercely um

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,200
tracking the scope creep so that

113
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,040
you know things didn't blow out of the

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
package

115
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
it managed to

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
to standardize the 400 zr

117
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,759
form factor

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
uh so you can see here i'm i'm showing

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,479
three plugs the the one on the left uh

120
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,960
zr that's this that's the standardized

121
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,320
zr plug

122
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,440
targeted that uh dci 80 to 120

123
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,120
kilometers

124
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,960
the second one is the zr plus and

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
this is using the same form factor the

126
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
same dsp actually but it implements a

127
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
different uh forward error correction

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,960
that allows it to

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,040
have a longer reach up into the 400 and

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,440
then beyond kilometers

131
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,400
and then recently announced is this uh

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,800
so-called zero dbm which has a higher

133
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,960
launch power through an amplifier in the

134
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,160
plug

135
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
and with this you actually have the

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
ability to introduce rodents into the

137
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
infrastructure which is important as

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,199
you'll see

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
so one of the things that we've

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,000
done with the introduction of this

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,840
technology is

142
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,240
a tcl modeling study

143
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,360
now we we picked an architecture of a

144
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,800
ring and a metro access ring uh and uh

145
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
to point out that

146
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
this is really uh

147
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,759
based on rings so if you've got a mesh

148
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,960
architecture

149
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
this these findings don't apply but but

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
for a ring we found we had some

151
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
interesting uh

152
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,120
uh results

153
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,039
so assumptions were that uh the ring

154
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,320
size was five to eight nodes uh from you

155
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,120
know 50 to 800 gig and we're assuming

156
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,639
the zero dbm pluggables so that we can

157
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,800
introduce rodents into the architecture

158
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,600
so here's a picture of uh

159
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
of our assumptions and how they work

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,680
with the with the ring so you can see in

161
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,520
the there's two pictures here in the top

162
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
picture uh traffic is being added at a3

163
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,400
for example

164
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
utilizing a rotom and you can see that

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,120
the traffic that's traversing the ring

166
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,960
um doesn't actually enter that router

167
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,880
unless it has to be added or dropped so

168
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,199
it's it's bypassed

169
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,039
the picture below shows a hop by hop

170
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,280
approach where all of the traffic enters

171
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,960
the router and

172
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,479
and is passed

173
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,199
around the ring

174
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
and so the impact of of this type of

175
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,720
architecture on the ring is that um you

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,319
end up

177
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,639
introducing more ports so as you can see

178
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,080
on the the chart on the left

179
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
the number of ports actually increases

180
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,039
significantly with the number of uh

181
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,880
nodes on the ring

182
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
and it's linear but you can look at

183
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,639
you're looking at between two and five

184
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,360
times the number of uh ports versus a

185
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,000
road and bypass architecture

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
and then on the on the right chart you

187
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,639
can see that as bandwidth increases on

188
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,560
the nodes you actually

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,479
have an exponential increase in the

190
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,919
number of ports because again the the uh

191
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,919
the traffic as it gets introduced on the

192
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,319
on the access nodes has to traverse

193
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
through each and every router so you

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
have to build out the routers to be able

195
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,280
to accommodate that

196
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,160
and really the the message here is that

197
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
if you're utilizing a ring topology and

198
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,479
again it doesn't apply to to a mesh

199
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,160
it's likely going to be cheaper to

200
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,759
maintain your

201
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,479
rotom bypass capability than just go to

202
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,160
than moving to a

203
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,120
straight hop by hop

204
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,000
and a quick note uh on power consumption

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,199
this wasn't

206
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,720
really part of the study but we did look

207
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,080
at it

208
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,440
that the um when you add up the added uh

209
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,319
power consumption of the dcos you know

210
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,240
20 per dcl or between per um vr plug

211
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
and then another 64 or 400 gig

212
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
connection within the router

213
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,360
you're topping out around 100 uh watts

214
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
per connection

215
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
and uh

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,319
versus a 4 watts for for a rotom and

217
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,919
although it doesn't sound like much 96

218
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,960
watts

219
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,120
over the course of a of a full ring you

220
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,559
can see the numbers

221
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,119
do become significant

222
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,440
all right so now let's jump into uh the

223
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
network management i like to look at it

224
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,080
as a gradient of complexity

225
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
um going from on the left you know a

226
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,640
very simple short reach ethernet

227
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,959
all the way to the most complex optical

228
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,120
line system

229
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,880
and when you start with

230
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
on the left with with a

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,720
short reach optic

232
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,600
uh

233
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,000
really is not much to it you plug it in

234
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,880
the link is up or down and uh that's all

235
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,959
there is to it

236
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,200
and and even when you uh

237
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
introduce uh amplifiers

238
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,800
uh

239
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,880
you're really still just looking at the

240
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,839
link being up or down

241
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,360
but when you

242
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,519
sir when you get into a dwdm

243
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,920
uh scenario then you've got multiple

244
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
wavelengths on the same fiber so in

245
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,120
addition to you know needing to know

246
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
whether the link is up or down

247
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,000
you might want to have a channel plan

248
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,040
and

249
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
you might want to manage the power as

250
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,279
well so if you're adding wavelengths to

251
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:45,920
a

252
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,480
fully filled fiber

253
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,160
it does help to uh to ramp the power um

254
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,839
over time as opposed to just turning it

255
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,560
on

256
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,279
to avoid impacting uh neighboring

257
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,839
wavelengths

258
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
and when you get into

259
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,800
dwdm uh if for multiple spans that

260
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920
introduce more uh line amplifiers

261
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,360
you can start to have a need for

262
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,079
active power management and so in this

263
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,880
case

264
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
uh you start you're starting to get into

265
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,680
the realm of potentially wanting a have

266
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,360
a an optical controller in place because

267
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
it's vendor specific it can it

268
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,440
understands uh the nature of the

269
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,920
underlying optical system and you know

270
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,160
you can control it in a more efficient

271
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,560
manner

272
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,880
and especially as you move into

273
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,920
obviously

274
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,399
the longer reach uh scenarios up to a

275
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,959
thousand kilometers 1300 kilometers

276
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,200
you're introducing possibly ramen pumps

277
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,880
into the network

278
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
and those

279
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,200
require uh dynamic gain equalization so

280
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
another complexity on the optical side

281
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,160
which which really is best left to the

282
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,200
optical uh controller

283
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,959
and then finally if you get to the you

284
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,279
know the most complex

285
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,160
scenario with a mix of transponders

286
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,719
rotoms

287
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,519
and amplifiers

288
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,480
you have still have all of the

289
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,200
requirements of the previous stages but

290
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
you also then maybe you get start to get

291
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,440
into pce at the optical level as well

292
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
so you can see there's a there's a

293
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,640
there's a wide range of requirements

294
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,680
here

295
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,640
that

296
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,000
really come into play that you have to

297
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,160
be aware of when you want to manage

298
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,199
these types of networks

299
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,680
so

300
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,120
this picture is depicting

301
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,399
an architecture that has separate

302
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,200
management of the ip and the optical

303
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,040
and since they're separate and the plugs

304
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,160
are on the router in this case the ip

305
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,360
controller management system

306
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
is going to control the pluggable so the

307
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,040
power level

308
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,120
the wavelength the parameters of of the

309
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,000
plug

310
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,760
and the optical management system

311
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,240
depending on the complexity

312
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,639
perhaps if you have uh underlying rotoms

313
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,600
within the within that line system uh

314
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,560
the optical management uh will provision

315
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,200
those links and in this case because

316
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,680
they're separate your optical system is

317
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,200
actually provisioning with so-called

318
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
alien wavelength uh it has no idea of

319
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
the service between

320
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
the ends of that wavelength but

321
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
it's provision the wavelength and

322
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,959
and the ip system controls the

323
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,959
parameters

324
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,680
a different approach is to use a

325
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,639
combined ip and optical controller

326
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,800
where this multi-domain

327
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
controller the mdsc

328
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
as it said in the standards

329
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,279
uses the industry standard tapi

330
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,279
interface to

331
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,920
transmit and retrieve parameters from

332
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,079
the optical underlay

333
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,360
the

334
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,760
overall management

335
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,040
of the end-to-end uh link provisioning

336
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,200
happens at the ip domain with the with

337
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,760
the the multi-domain control

338
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,639
but the optical management system has

339
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,600
the optical uh parameters

340
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
under its control so you can see here

341
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,639
that the

342
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,800
the optical controller is actually has

343
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
control over the plugables the power

344
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,720
levels which you know become more

345
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,880
important as we get into the uh

346
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,760
the higher output zero dbm plugs

347
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,320
and then obviously all of the optical

348
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,639
layer as well

349
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,120
one thing to mention in this scenario is

350
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,600
that the optical

351
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
controller

352
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
is actually interfacing through the

353
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,920
router to the plugs so

354
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,600
you know in this case i'm showing uh

355
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
controlling it via netconf using an open

356
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,079
config model but that's something that

357
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,360
you're going to want to consider if

358
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,560
you're looking at this approach

359
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,160
so let's

360
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
talk a little bit about

361
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,519
why it might be a good idea for you to

362
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,920
consider

363
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
ip optical coordination and a

364
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
multi-domain controller

365
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,480
so the ip optical is a unique space um

366
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,040
because it's always been and continues

367
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,880
to be dominated by operational silos

368
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,079
and

369
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,440
operators

370
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,160
often rely on on different teams one for

371
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,480
optical one for ip

372
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,079
in a larger you know well staffed

373
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,920
group the person who starts an

374
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,760
investigation into a problem say on the

375
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,320
ip side likely isn't the person that's

376
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,399
going to solve it if it's an optical

377
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,839
issue

378
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,160
and so you end up with tickets and

379
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,600
it's an inefficient

380
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,279
communication of

381
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,519
of issues and even in the case of a

382
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,480
of a smaller team that are handling both

383
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,079
domains

384
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,760
they may have different tools and so you

385
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,199
end up end up

386
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
with cutting and pasting and it's

387
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,120
inefficient error prone

388
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,639
in either case

389
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,120
having a multi-domain controller that

390
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
you know has visibility to alarm

391
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,240
information and topology

392
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,360
makes for a more efficient

393
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,199
operating system to to work with

394
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
there's a number of use cases um that

395
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,079
take advantage of this cross-domain

396
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,360
control

397
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
but one of the main ones is related to

398
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,480
commuting

399
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
communicating the optical srlg

400
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
information or the shared risk link

401
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,000
groups

402
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,560
from the optical domain to the ip domain

403
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
so that

404
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,600
the pce on the ip side now has the has

405
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000
the information it needs to maintain

406
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,120
diversity between protection paths

407
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,399
if the pce

408
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,800
uh doesn't have the full picture

409
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,399
um it could uh route paths that are it

410
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,639
thinks they're diverse when actually the

411
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,560
underlying optical infrastructure is

412
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,800
routing that uh both paths across the

413
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,759
same

414
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,360
link and it's at risk

415
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,959
so with cross-domain coordination

416
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,480
you know that's one of the main use

417
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,440
cases but once you have that

418
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,759
that communication between the ip and

419
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,320
the optical domains uh it opens up a

420
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,639
wide array of uh valuable use cases

421
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,959
i like to split them into sort of three

422
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,959
categories the first one being the

423
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,120
discovery aspects

424
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,680
second is the correlation aspects and

425
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,800
then finally the optimization

426
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
use cases

427
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,600
the first one under discovery

428
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,560
really forms the basis of of all of the

429
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
remaining use cases

430
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,920
because it's where

431
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,079
the coordination between the ip ports

432
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,320
and the optical ports usually over a

433
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
grey optic link

434
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,399
is discovered automatically with

435
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,280
ldp snooping and once that correlation

436
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,959
once those uh

437
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,039
ports are are correlated

438
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,400
all of the other

439
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,919
use cases uh become possible

440
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,599
the first one being the diversity

441
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,760
analysis again being able to see the

442
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,480
underlying optical infrastructure and

443
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,959
and being able to alarm when

444
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,439
an lsp or two lsps that need to be

445
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,400
diverse are traversing an underlying

446
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,880
shared link

447
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,520
for coordination of uh assurance and

448
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,679
troubleshooting i mentioned that earlier

449
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,039
this is where

450
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,880
you have an ip alarm that has an

451
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,160
underlying root cause which is optical

452
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,919
and

453
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,440
you know you can be faced with a flood

454
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,039
of of unrelated alarms or sub alarms

455
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,440
that can be you know masked out

456
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
uh and uh have a root cause analysis

457
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,640
done if you understand the correlation

458
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,400
between the ip and the optical side

459
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,000
elastic ip and optical bandwidth

460
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,240
this relies on

461
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,440
the communication of the multi-domain

462
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,120
controller with both the ip and the

463
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,480
optical side

464
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,200
and it can dynamically change uh ports

465
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,880
on both sides of uh both domains

466
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,360
so for example if you've got um

467
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,720
you know during the day you've got a lot

468
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,559
of east-west traffic

469
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,880
or north-south traffic say happening on

470
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,799
a particular lag

471
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,880
say with three members and then in the

472
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
evening that traffic demand changes into

473
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,320
a more of an east-west uh

474
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,080
picture

475
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,640
a cross-domain coordination element or

476
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,160
controller

477
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,120
can

478
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,480
switch the the lag elements dynamically

479
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
by because it has control over both the

480
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,400
ip and the optical side this is just one

481
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,240
that's sort of a calendaring

482
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,080
application but you can also do it based

483
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,799
on

484
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,919
uh

485
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,840
the bandwidth utilization of a

486
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,600
particular lag or port and have

487
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,320
a series of inventory that can be added

488
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,400
to uh to a particular lag when when it's

489
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,880
required

490
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,520
the coordinated operations

491
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,559
control this relates to

492
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,480
performing maintenance on optical links

493
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,960
if you don't have a view to

494
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
the traffic that's running on an optical

495
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,559
link uh sometimes it can be difficult to

496
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,360
know uh whether you know taking that

497
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,280
link down is gonna have adverse effects

498
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,760
on on the traffic and so

499
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,799
with uh

500
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,320
visibility into both the ip and the

501
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
optical you could you could actually go

502
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,000
and simulate the impact of taking the

503
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,480
link down um on the lsps and see how

504
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,320
they see how they reroute within the

505
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,960
system uh and uh

506
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,760
for take that further and um

507
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,679
you know if you're satisfied with how

508
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,200
the pce is going to

509
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,440
going to reroute things

510
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,760
you can go ahead and instruct it to to

511
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,440
do that reroute but prior to

512
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,679
taking the link down

513
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,880
so then you can take the link down

514
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,640
perform the maintenance

515
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,880
and bring it back up with no impact to

516
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,280
traffic

517
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,679
cost-effective multi-layer protection

518
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,120
this is getting into more of the

519
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
optimization

520
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,240
features

521
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,799
this one is is related to uh

522
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,080
protecting lag members for example again

523
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,640
with the capability of uh controlling

524
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,880
the ip ports and the configuration and

525
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,000
the optical

526
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
port configurations you can um on a link

527
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,240
going down you can do an automatic

528
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,720
protection switch and sort of a one plus

529
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,440
or one for n uh protection scheme versus

530
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,000
having to duplicate the whole lag or all

531
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
the members of the leg

532
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,760
saves capex

533
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,039
and port

534
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,799
deployments

535
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,440
optical aware ip routing is

536
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,760
i guess it's an expansion of

537
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,480
the srlg communication but you can also

538
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,440
bring

539
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,320
across other optical parameters such as

540
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,760
latency for example into the pce so that

541
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
path computation and

542
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,159
path placement and optimization can

543
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,080
take advantage of knowing what the

544
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
latency is and the underlying optical

545
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,360
links

546
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,679
and make more efficient use of

547
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,840
of the path placement

548
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
and then finally the cross domain

549
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,400
connection management relates to

550
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,880
using the the cross domain controller

551
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,640
across multiple

552
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,039
vendors or multiple optical domains if

553
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,520
you've got a large network uh utilizing

554
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,120
the tapi interface

555
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
such that you have a consistent

556
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,640
abstraction of all of the

557
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,360
optical underlay and you can create more

558
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,559
easily create end-to-end services across

559
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,520
the different domains

560
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,159
so now some specific use cases related

561
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,720
to 400 zr zr texas right

562
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
so when it comes to adding coherent

563
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,360
optical plugs to your router

564
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,320
the complexity can range from point to

565
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,720
point you know very simple uh to a

566
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,679
hop-by-hop mesh type of architecture all

567
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,440
the way to as we said the

568
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,039
a rotom-based

569
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,320
brownfield

570
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,080
deployment

571
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,679
and these are different approaches and

572
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,919
they utilize different management

573
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,480
solutions

574
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,039
in the simplest case

575
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,200
you have the ip controller managing the

576
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,799
entire system

577
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,039
this still may require some planning you

578
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,200
know inventory of the optical

579
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,520
wavelengths and channels

580
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,240
and in the more complex case uh with a

581
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,200
fixed optical add drop mux or a photon

582
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,600
type of deployment

583
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,520
you can still have the ip controlling

584
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,039
the underlying

585
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,480
optical system

586
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,200
depending on the capabilities of the of

587
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,760
the management system

588
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
but you you may want to introduce the

589
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,880
optical controller in that case

590
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,679
and then finally if you combine them

591
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,280
using this multi-domain controller

592
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
you can then

593
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,039
instruct the underlying controllers

594
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,880
which have you know the best

595
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,200
capabilities per domain

596
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
combine them together and also utilize

597
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,720
some of the planning information that

598
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
goes along with the

599
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
the optical infrastructure

600
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,000
to uh to better

601
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,360
um route your uh your paths and

602
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,200
according to

603
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,480
the the requirements and the

604
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,240
capabilities of the underlying optical

605
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,559
system

606
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,640
so i want to dig a little bit deeper

607
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,120
into this hybrid scenario with the

608
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
bypass tunnels

609
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,799
so we've talked about using this this

610
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,880
multi-domain controller to set up your

611
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,000
400 zr zr link but once you have that

612
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,039
capability in place it actually unlocks

613
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,400
other possibilities for example with

614
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,559
intent-based provisioning you can

615
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,360
simplify the life cycle management of

616
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,960
your zr link

617
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,120
if you're not familiar with

618
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,400
intents

619
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,480
in its simplest form

620
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,120
it's about describing what you want as

621
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,279
an outcome versus how you want the

622
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,559
outcome to be

623
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,080
delivered

624
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,200
um

625
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,159
simplifying you know operations but what

626
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,279
it also gives you is a centralized

627
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,880
database a single source of truth

628
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,080
about the desired state of the network

629
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,360
so the operator then has a capability of

630
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,799
running audits on on the

631
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,400
on the state and

632
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,640
uh monitoring for sort of out-of-band

633
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,159
changes for example in the middle of the

634
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,520
night a cli

635
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
command gets

636
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,400
used uh and the the

637
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
network is now out of sync with the

638
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
intent

639
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,440
that can be flagged and you can actually

640
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,279
re-synchronize by pushing the intent

641
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,120
once again to the annoying network

642
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
elements and at least you know you've

643
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,919
got

644
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,440
a one-to-one correlation between your

645
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,919
network and what your

646
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,080
your management system believes the

647
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,320
intent is

648
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,799
so if we look at an example and intent

649
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,960
here

650
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,120
create a 400g connection between new

651
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,400
york city and san francisco

652
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,799
the multi-domain controller can use the

653
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,480
planning tool input

654
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,039
to determine the least expensive path to

655
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,000
achieve that desired link it may be zero

656
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
links over a hop by hop

657
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,640
infrastructure or by a long-haul optics

658
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,880
if if they're available and the and the

659
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,360
underlying link budgets are

660
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,918
work out

661
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,720
and this is all done in

662
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,840
in a model driven approach although

663
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,440
usually a

664
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,960
legacy

665
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,799
infrastructure is also supported using

666
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,158
an snmp for example

667
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,320
so with any new technology

668
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,559
you know there's a number of uh

669
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,159
challenges there's

670
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,400
also a number of solutions that are uh

671
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,720
being brought to bear now on uh

672
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,440
on this uh you know new way of

673
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,080
of transmitting uh coherent uh

674
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,960
wavelengths but again the key is that

675
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,840
there's no one size fits all solution

676
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,120
uh depending on the amount of

677
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,600
integration uh that you want to do with

678
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,439
your existing infrastructure

679
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,360
and and the architecture that you

680
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,520
actually select whether it's a uh

681
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,919
depending on the location in the uh in

682
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,679
the network whether it's rings versus

683
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,000
mesh

684
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,760
and the number of zr components that you

685
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,799
choose to use

686
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,720
this challenge of

687
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,480
overcoming separate ip and optical

688
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,760
domains

689
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,120
really this gap widens with 400 cr

690
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,760
because you are pulling the optical

691
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,600
domain for all intensive purposes into

692
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,840
the router so

693
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,400
this cross-domain coordination

694
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,240
capability becomes even more important

695
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,440
and then of course there's always

696
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,399
multi-vendor considerations

697
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,399
both at the ip level and at the optical

698
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,880
level or

699
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,080
network level

700
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,240
uh but also the plugs themselves you

701
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,799
know there's uh interop um promised

702
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,799
interrupt between plugs so that has to

703
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,600
be

704
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,480
qualified and tested which i think we're

705
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,600
going to see

706
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,279
the oif do some testing uh at ofc coming

707
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,440
up

708
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,919
so i mean there's a number of uh of

709
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,799
challenges to be overcome but i think uh

710
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,679
cross

711
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,640
controllers and the infrastructure of a

712
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,760
of an sdn enabled uh management system

713
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,240
can really help to uh to overcome

714
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,880
these challenges

715
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,760
that uh concludes my discussion and i've

716
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
provided some references here

717
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
to the tapi agreement

718
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,039
as well as a few others

719
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,440
all right we do have some questions on

720
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
the chat online and if any of you in the

721
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,559
room would like to get up and ask some

722
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,760
questions feel free to ask well

723
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
otherwise we'll just work through these

724
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,320
all right so blake says blake will this

725
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,399
talk is excellent thanks peter do you

726
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,640
have customers using coherent broadcast

727
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,360
and select with plc splitters instead of

728
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,679
rotom's alatera stream and if so any

729
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,279
feedback on the challenges faced would

730
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,360
be appreciated thanks again

731
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,600
hey blake how are you doing

732
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,919
thanks for the question um we may i'm

733
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,399
not aware of uh any customers doing that

734
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,840
but uh it's a viable option and uh i'm

735
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,440
sure we do we've got a lot of customers

736
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,279
and uh uh

737
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,960
i can't give you any specifics but yeah

738
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,000
and then

739
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,760
chris woodfield asks what is your

740
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,279
assessment of the swivel chair

741
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,120
operations model in terms of your

742
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,799
confidence that the industry has enough

743
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,960
engineers with sufficient skills and

744
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,360
training to work with both

745
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,760
yeah i mean that's that's a great topic

746
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
i think that's a whole discussion in

747
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,840
itself uh how you know

748
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,480
the the workforce and uh

749
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,559
you know the aging of the workforce and

750
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,679
uh

751
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,520
the optical teams and the ip teams

752
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,559
coming together i think you know the

753
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,960
this is where the multi-domain

754
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,679
infrastructure can really help

755
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,720
it's

756
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,440
not only combining the the layers and

757
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,120
the domains

758
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,039
but it's also providing some information

759
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,960
to you know a traditional um ip engineer

760
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,840
uh

761
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,200
through these tools can really learn a

762
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,799
lot about the optical infrastructure and

763
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,760
vice versa so

764
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
okay and then we've got one more on here

765
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,640
james harr asks why not do something

766
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,039
similar to a lower bandwidth wave side

767
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,200
channel to provide and propagate

768
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,840
information between optical components

769
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,000
including the 400 zr plus optic on the

770
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,080
client side and has there been any work

771
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,600
in this area

772
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,760
uh well sounds like an optical service

773
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,159
channel that uh it's referring to and

774
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,000
that that is done um and and um that is

775
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,279
something actually that we're looking at

776
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,000
as well on the cr side to provide sort

777
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,080
of uh some out-of-band

778
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,120
uh capabilities but um yeah that's a

779
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,279
good point

780
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,120
that's all i see here

781
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,279
anybody

782
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,120
all right well thank you very much peter

783
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,520
thank you

784
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,260
