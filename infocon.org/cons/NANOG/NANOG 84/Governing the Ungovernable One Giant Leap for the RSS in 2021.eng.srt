00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,359
hello from london england this is going

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,559
to be a talk on governing the

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,519
ungovernable now you'll notice that

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,759
that's in quotes because nothing is

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,160
truly ungovernable but i want to talk

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,320
about what i'm calling one giant leap

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,800
for the root server system in

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,039
2021 the year just gone it was a big

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,400
year for the root server system and i'm

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,240
going to explain why

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,160
now to begin you might know this already

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,320
but here's the high points i'm a lawyer

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,840
i've been working with the internet and

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,920
information technology for 30 years i've

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,760
been teaching legal and regulatory

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,559
aspects of cyber security for 20 years

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,440
and i was closely involved in assisting

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,719
with the development of the rsac

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,559
document that i'm going to be discussing

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,800
later in this presentation i'll spend

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,239
more time talking to you about all of

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,840
that and of course the big old legal

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,360
disclaimer all of my comments are

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,120
personal do not necessarily represent

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
the opinions of anybody possibly not

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,399
even myself

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,280
now

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
today's agenda i'm going to take us

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,399
through three things

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,879
i first want to give a brief history of

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,799
the root server system and when i say

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,200
brief i mean brief and it's going to be

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
as told by a lawyer

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,240
i'm then going to talk about an effort

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,200
by a sovereign state to regulate the

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
root server system specifically the

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,520
draft eu nis 2 directive and then i'll

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
be walking you through

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
essentially the success criteria that

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,360
were developed for root server system

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,920
governance in rsac o58 so those are our

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,479
three points now to begin

44
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,799
this is incredibly dangerous i'm about

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,280
to talk to a room full of experts about

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,079
a highly technical subject which i can

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
claim only limited understanding so i'm

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,720
going to do this in a way on the

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,640
assumption that there might be one or

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
two people in the room like me who are

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,360
lawyers who would like an explanation so

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,439
since i'm only going to explain this for

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
people like me who are lawyers i thought

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,520
the simplest way to do it would be to

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,640
reduce it to a socratic dialogue and as

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,200
i'm sure you all know a socratic

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
dialogue is where an old and crusty

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,318
professor asks questions of a young and

59
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,038
eager student questions like

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,920
so where can i find the ip address of

61
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,120
www.example.com the student being a good

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,520
student says that's easy ask the

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,959
authoritative server for the domain

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,560
example.com now socrates is not to be

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
put off by that and says

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,879
where can i find the ip address of the

67
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,319
authoritative server for the domain

68
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,239
example.com to which plato replies why

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,080
you just ask the authoritative server

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,319
for the dot com top level top level

71
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,760
domain

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
all right next question from the

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,720
professor

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,800
where can i find the ip address of the

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,040
authoritative server for the dot com top

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,760
level domain to which the answer is all

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,200
you need to do

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
is ask any one

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,599
of the root servers

80
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
in the root server system the root

81
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,040
server system the rss

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
okay because a root server system does

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,200
what a root server does what a root

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
server publishes to the world the

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
contents of the root zone which is to

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,440
say a list of ip addresses and ip number

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,159
addresses of the authoritative servers

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,360
for each and every top level domain

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,959
registry

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,239
and who operates the root servers see

91
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,159
this is truly an example of an easy

92
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,040
question

93
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,440
the root server operators are the people

94
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,400
who operate the root servers

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,480
and very good you get that kind of a

96
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
cookie

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,200
now this is where the student turns

98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,879
things around on the professor and says

99
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,319
hang on a second

100
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,879
we've talked about what the root server

101
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,400
system is but who are these root server

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,720
operators at this point the professor

103
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
takes a sidestep and says well that's

104
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
not socratic dialogue that's merely a

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,280
recitation of history so let's look at

106
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,000
the great scroll of history of the rss

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,720
or as we call it rsac o23

108
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
and we find that the very first root

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,400
server for dns as we know it was set up

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,720
in 1984 by john postell and paul

111
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,040
mccapetris at the university of southern

112
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,599
california and we find that by the end

113
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,160
of 1985 there wasn't just one root

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,720
server there were four two of them at

115
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,759
the university one at sri and one at the

116
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
ballistic research lab u.s army

117
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,240
now a few more years roll by

118
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,560
1991 there's only six root servers and

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,919
six rsos and october 91 is a special

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,600
time for me that was when i sent and

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,800
received my first ever internet email

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
now in 1994

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,440
the organization i work for isc suddenly

124
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,479
appears in this club with ns.isc.org

125
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,440
and by 1995 there are nine route servers

126
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,240
and nine rsos that was also the year

127
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,199
that they were renamed to

128
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,840
rootservers.net with the lettering

129
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,639
scheme abcdfghi

130
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,960
so what happens next a little bit more

131
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,280
of the same

132
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,840
1997 the system added letters jklm and

133
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
as you can see in that same year k ended

134
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,720
up with ripe in europe m ended up with

135
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,880
wide in japan in 1998 icann was founded

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,440
wow gosh we're 14 years after the

137
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,039
establishment of the first route server

138
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,960
and now icann has found it and that same

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,680
year l root moves to icann a couple

140
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,320
years later verisign acquires nsi with

141
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,560
it they acquire a root and j root i root

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,199
moves to net nod cogent acquires psi in

143
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,120
it and gets c root

144
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
and that's kind of it

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,160
really i mean from 2002 until today for

146
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,720
20 years that's kind of

147
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,680
the entire group no one really changes

148
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
identity after that

149
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,960
meanwhile changes to the surrounding

150
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,080
environment in 2002 f root our

151
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,479
organization isc the first route server

152
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,960
to be any casted internationally

153
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
eventually just about everyone follows i

154
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,720
think now everyone has followed that

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,600
practice and then in 2014 to 16

156
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
something incredibly important happens

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,360
the iana function

158
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
transitions from the us government to

159
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,680
icann

160
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,800
so

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,160
who do we see today january 2022 i

162
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,880
should say february 2022

163
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,400
as of today

164
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,240
here's your list of 13 letters 12 root

165
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
server operators and their corresponding

166
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,199
iep address numbers

167
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,199
total statistics

168
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,600
12 operators

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,960
use the 13 letter addresses

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,199
those addresses resolve to more than one

171
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,639
thousand four hundred and fifty root

172
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,639
server instances if the number is over

173
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,080
fourteen hundred and eighty if you wanna

174
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,520
point your browser at root hyphen

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,280
servers dot net you can get the exact

176
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,520
count as of right now

177
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
those root server instances are located

178
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,199
in more than 100 sovereign states they

179
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,319
operate 24 365 without interruption

180
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,319
they've done so for 30 years

181
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
and they do one thing they publish the

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
root zone to the world

183
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,400
at no charge

184
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
pretty good system

185
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,199
pretty stable

186
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,599
it's worked very well for a very long

187
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,599
time

188
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,599
step two of our talk today

189
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,280
i'm going to slow the pace down because

190
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,199
now i'm talking about

191
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,360
something slightly different

192
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,599
this is a piece of legislation nis 2

193
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,639
which i'm calling the accidental maybe

194
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,919
rss killer possibly or at least maybe

195
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,360
that was maybe it would have maybe it

196
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,039
would not have time

197
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,720
not quite there yet all right what am i

198
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
talking about those of you who don't

199
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,560
follow legislation and with any luck

200
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,160
that's most of you because who wants to

201
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,199
do that other than someone like me

202
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,919
the first nis directive as many of you

203
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,840
probably already know came around in

204
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,800
2016 and basically it was a european

205
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
directive

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
where the european union said to its

207
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
member states hey cyber security is kind

208
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
of important especially where critical

209
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,599
national infrastructure is concerned

210
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,240
so why don't all of you pull yourself

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,879
together and raise the standards a bit

212
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
let's raise the bar let's actually try

213
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,759
to secure critical national

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,360
infrastructure throughout the european

215
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,560
union wouldn't that be nice now nis 1

216
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,800
did not apply

217
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
to dns

218
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,520
services

219
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,759
as such

220
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,440
now roll the clock forward to late 2020

221
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
and everyone kind of realizes you know

222
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,360
what nis 1

223
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,160
isn't really going far enough we need to

224
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,919
be much more aggressive about what we

225
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,599
think of as critical and what we think

226
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,240
of as things we rely on and trust and so

227
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,279
nis ii a draft law it's still draft it

228
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,320
hasn't been passed yet it is still draft

229
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,958
draft comes out in late 2020 and it

230
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,200
includes dns services along with a lot

231
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,560
of other things

232
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,080
dns is a small part of nis 2 and the

233
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
root server system is an even smaller

234
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,080
part of nis 2 just a part that's very

235
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,959
important to root server operators

236
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,080
this draft law specifically targets

237
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,600
calls out names describes root servers

238
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
as a subject for regulation and although

239
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
this law has a small business exception

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
the small business exception does not

241
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
apply

242
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,279
to root servers

243
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,360
in the late 2020 draft of the law

244
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,080
so

245
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,440
why was this or why is this i'm not

246
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,519
quite sure which of those two words is

247
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,880
correct yet

248
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,360
why was it a problem

249
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
it's a problem because of the geographic

250
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,240
scope of the regulation

251
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,200
the commission draft in 2020

252
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,959
would mandate the regulation of everyone

253
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,640
who provides root server services

254
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,760
to

255
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,040
people in the european union

256
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
this formulation should start to sound

257
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,240
familiar to many of you who follow the

258
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,920
european union in its legislative

259
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
process but that's a story for a

260
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
different day or for the question and

261
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
answer session

262
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,040
so

263
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,120
the problem of course is that the root

264
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,920
server system is a globally unified

265
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,959
system

266
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
massively distributed highly resilient

267
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,480
service

268
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,440
and

269
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,519
all 12 root server operators manage

270
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,040
maintain

271
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
some

272
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
equipment that is located in the

273
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,440
european union people in the european

274
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,920
union consult route servers that are

275
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,959
geo-located both inside and outside the

276
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,200
european union and they consult and they

277
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,440
consult root servers that are operated

278
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,160
by all 12 of the rsos so the bottom line

279
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,000
of why is this a problem

280
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,320
is that regulating people who operate

281
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
root servers delivering service to

282
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,760
people in the eu means regulating all 12

283
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,800
of them so we're talking about everybody

284
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,959
in the organization

285
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,079
so

286
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,000
why is that a problem rob what's wrong

287
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
with regulating root server operators

288
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,120
okay here it is the slippery slope of

289
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
let's say one

290
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
national regulation and even under the

291
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560
directive it wouldn't be one

292
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,000
because under the directive the

293
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,640
directive says that eu member states 27

294
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,240
of them

295
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
can each theoretically

296
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,640
regulate the rss

297
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
that wouldn't necessarily be all 27 but

298
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
it's going to be more than one for

299
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,399
reasons we can talk about

300
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,760
well if these 27 sovereign states have

301
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
the authority and the right and the

302
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
obligation to regulate the root service

303
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,320
system

304
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,360
why not sovereign states number 28 29 30

305
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,440
all the way up to 192 which is the

306
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,959
number that i chose because i believe

307
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,399
it's the number of states that are full

308
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,839
members of the united nations today

309
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,240
what's wrong with that picture the risk

310
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
of conflicting standards reporting

311
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,440
requirements etc eventually would create

312
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,120
operating pressure to fracture the rss

313
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,079
along

314
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,440
national border lines and that threatens

315
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,480
the unity and the resilience of the rss

316
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,320
and besides

317
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,079
isn't this the type of issue that the

318
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,320
multi-stakeholder model is designed to

319
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,560
resolve don't we have a solution for

320
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,399
this problem already why create a

321
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,079
problem that we have already solved

322
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,959
now i do wonder

323
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,760
if that was intentional and the reason i

324
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,240
wonder about that is there is some

325
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
evidence that maybe some people inside

326
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,279
the european commission maybe it wasn't

327
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,079
their intention to regulate all 12

328
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,880
global rsos some of the foundation

329
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
documents uh that they prepared only

330
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,920
talk about the two rsos whose center of

331
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,399
business is in the european union some

332
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,399
of the informal discussions with the

333
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,880
staff and contact meetings suggested

334
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,800
that they didn't quite understand why we

335
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,040
were concerned there seemed to be some

336
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,480
suggestion that they weren't sure they

337
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,800
were regulating anyone except those

338
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,320
those those two but even regulating

339
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
those two i would argue creates the same

340
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
problem we're talking about because it's

341
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
a globally unified system

342
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,920
even so enter the european parliament

343
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
the european parliament more than 700

344
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,040
members of the european parliament

345
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,360
specifically a committee charged with

346
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,680
looking at this particular law

347
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,839
and a member of the european parliament

348
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,560
who acted as the reporter for this

349
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,800
particular piece of law draft law

350
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,079
and the european parliament works

351
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,760
differently from the u.s congress in the

352
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
european parliament they don't have a

353
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,200
thousand staff members who do everything

354
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
for them they actually find someone who

355
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
sits and votes and argues and talks and

356
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,760
says hey you know why don't you go

357
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,079
uh work on this for a while and draft a

358
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,160
draft a report and the guy who did it i

359
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,920
really encourage you to read this report

360
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,320
any of you who are worried about nis 2

361
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
in your businesses and i should say many

362
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
of you might need to be worried about

363
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,680
nis 2 and your businesses

364
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,600
should have a look at this report it's

365
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,959
very good

366
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,680
one of the very first things

367
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,399
this gentleman said in his report was

368
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,760
this root name servers should be out of

369
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,600
scope out of scope from the log because

370
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,880
regulating them is contrary to the eu's

371
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
own vision

372
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
of a single open neutral free secure and

373
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,720
unfragmented network

374
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,120
reason two if we regulate them it could

375
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,800
encourage and empower

376
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,040
other states which other states that's

377
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,480
not anything

378
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
other states

379
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
who advocate for a top-down state

380
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,639
controlled governance approach instead

381
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,360
of multi-stakeholder now this is a

382
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,680
really polite way in fact i'm surprised

383
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,639
at how strongly worded this is given

384
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,480
that this is a given this is a

385
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,959
legislator in the european parliament

386
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,600
but this is i interpret this to mean hey

387
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,279
we shouldn't regulate this because we

388
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,519
could break the internet

389
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,279
and let's not do that please

390
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,519
the parliamentary committee

391
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,000
said yep we're completely on board with

392
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
the whole report and they voted 70 to 3

393
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,279
in favor of it so pretty popular and the

394
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,120
parliamentary redraft came out in

395
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
november of 2021 they not only removed

396
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
the references to root servers they

397
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
actually wrote into the draft law their

398
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,519
draft version of the law root servers

399
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,839
are not

400
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,120
included i mean that's not the exact

401
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,880
words but that's the that's the gist of

402
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,040
it that's the legal impact of it

403
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
and so now the question comes up what

404
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,680
happens next well what happens next is

405
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
the european parliament sits down with

406
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,360
the european council or at least

407
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,279
representatives of both of those groups

408
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,120
and they try to reach an agreement on

409
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,040
exactly what the directive is going to

410
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,279
say they're aided by the european

411
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,720
commission which is why these are called

412
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,800
the trial log discussions we're keeping

413
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,480
an eye on that this year and we'll see

414
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,639
what happens next now that's what

415
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,480
happens when sovereign states start

416
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,920
looking at the problem of governance

417
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,000
what happens when the governed

418
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,320
themselves start looking at the problem

419
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,680
of governance

420
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,839
so here what we see or what i want to

421
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,920
tell you is a little story about root

422
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,680
server system governance

423
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,600
what's been happening with it and what

424
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,160
was a pretty big deal

425
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,000
about this last year

426
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,600
okay let's begin

427
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,120
with the rss governance challenge

428
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,279
see the thing you need to remember

429
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,480
is that the root servers

430
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
are not

431
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,880
directly

432
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,839
incorporated within the overall icann

433
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,079
governance structure

434
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,920
now i'm trying to choose my words very

435
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,440
carefully because i don't want you to

436
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,920
read either too much or too little into

437
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,360
that statement

438
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,839
the root server operators

439
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,839
take

440
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
as uh effectively take as the ultimate

441
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,759
source of truth the root zone as

442
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,920
published by ayana

443
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,240
you know we don't decide what's in or

444
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,959
out of the root zone that's not the job

445
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,880
the job is publishing

446
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,800
the root zone as it's handed to us

447
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,720
so the root servers

448
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,440
root server operators themselves

449
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,480
live in a slightly

450
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
different position

451
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
to a lot of other people

452
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,359
at the bottom of internet architecture

453
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,000
so we have this governance challenge

454
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,079
someone makes the observation

455
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,480
there is no governance structure

456
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,000
for the rss

457
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,400
i've heard people say this

458
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,959
or is there

459
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,559
foreshadowing

460
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,000
okay

461
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
first i'm going to talk about one small

462
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
step and by the way when i when i use

463
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,520
this i just want to go from one small

464
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,679
step to one giant leap in fact i'm i'm

465
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,760
really not giving this next this next

466
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
slide does not give nearly enough credit

467
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
to what happened here

468
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,919
the root server operators over a three

469
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,640
year period basically recognized you

470
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,799
know hey we really need to do something

471
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,640
about governance i mean bear in mind

472
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,080
remember 2014 to 2016 is when ayana is

473
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,400
transitioning over to icann so it's

474
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,200
about the same time that the rsos say

475
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,160
hey we need to do something to formalize

476
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,360
to bring forward to crystallize to our

477
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,919
governance structure they go through a

478
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,600
series of workshops during that

479
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,679
three-year period and that results in

480
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,600
the publication of something called rsac

481
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,080
o37

482
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,360
rsac o30 so rsac yeah that's the root

483
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,160
server system advisory committee for

484
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,919
those of you who don't play you know

485
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,640
icann bingo the root server system

486
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,880
advisory committee

487
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,039
it is a group of people

488
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,160
who are

489
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
who exist to give advice

490
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,640
to the icann board as well as issue

491
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,559
publications of concern

492
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,919
related to

493
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,200
the root server system it has 12 voting

494
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
seats 12 rsos 12 voting seats that was

495
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,840
not an accident

496
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,080
plus a whole series of icann liaisons

497
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,559
observers staff people to

498
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
come and make representations and give

499
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,559
information and get information it's

500
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,400
it's it's a good thing and it's a very

501
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,799
formal body with formal rules so arsako

502
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,520
37 a proposed governance model for the

503
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,720
dns root server system 50 pages i mean

504
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,760
this is a pretty hefty document it has a

505
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
lot of stuff in it it's a very very good

506
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
read

507
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,160
plus 038 an accompanying document which

508
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,080
is three specific recommendations to the

509
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,640
icann board saying hey i can board we

510
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,240
just wrote this big document about

511
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,160
governance and here are three things we

512
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,480
think you should do

513
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,760
marvelous

514
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,640
so

515
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,280
what does the icann board do well

516
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,520
responding to those recommendations say

517
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,200
hey great recommendations thank you

518
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,320
arsak

519
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,840
they do a couple of things after

520
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,120
spending some time in public

521
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,720
consultations they say okay here's what

522
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,919
we're going to do

523
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,840
we're going to charter

524
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,240
a special ad hoc

525
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,160
group a committee whatever whatever you

526
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,679
want to call it

527
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,760
the root server system governance

528
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,360
working group the

529
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,440
gwg i'm going to be saying the letters

530
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,919
gwg a lot for the rest of this talk so

531
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,640
might as well just settle in now

532
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,240
the icann board gives the gwg the rss

533
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,280
governance working group the task of

534
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,080
proposing

535
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
a model

536
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,000
root server system governance structure

537
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,880
that takes account of our sac o 37

538
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,400
another document called osa rsac o42 and

539
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,799
a bunch of other stuff

540
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,480
so what happens well whenever you

541
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
charter a group like this it takes some

542
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,840
time to figure out who's going to be

543
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,760
seated at the table various communities

544
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,120
have to appoint people all that kind of

545
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,919
good stuff they started work in january

546
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,600
2020 and early in 2021 they produced a

547
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,960
draft

548
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,559
model

549
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,400
a draft model

550
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,640
not their final output they produce a

551
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,720
draft and they start

552
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,120
getting the idea of let's

553
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,479
let's expose this a little bit

554
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,919
now the root server operators

555
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,000
all of them

556
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
read the draft model

557
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,799
and that's when things started to get

558
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,240
really interesting really fast

559
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,400
so the reason things get interesting is

560
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,720
because the draft model produced by the

561
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,480
gwg early in 2021 has actually

562
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,240
drifted

563
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,080
pretty far from arsako 37 i mean that's

564
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,919
my opinion other people might say well

565
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,159
it's a little closer to rsac37 it's not

566
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,480
that far it's a little far well amongst

567
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,960
the rsos the feeling was

568
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,679
this doesn't really seem to have taken

569
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,880
close account

570
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,919
of o37 and o42 and a bunch of other

571
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,120
things

572
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,640
so the question becomes how are we going

573
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,600
to structure a productive conversation

574
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,080
with gwg how do we push this forward

575
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,720
option one everyone shouted each other

576
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
no i mean that's as as as fun as that

577
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
can be sometimes no that that's not the

578
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,840
way to you know to be grown up about it

579
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,400
and advance the cause option two which

580
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
was a very heartfelt and sincere

581
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
suggestion was well you know if you

582
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,520
don't like that model

583
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
let's look at this other model or here's

584
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,039
something else we have on the shelf that

585
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,559
does something else what do you think

586
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,159
about this other model

587
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,520
and that actually prompted an

588
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,360
interesting inquiry

589
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,320
which led to the looking at option three

590
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,520
how would we know the difference between

591
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,280
a good

592
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,400
model

593
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,799
and one that wasn't good

594
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,720
how do if we're prepa if we're shown two

595
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,400
different models

596
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,159
what system would we use to choose

597
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,600
between them is it just sort of like oh

598
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,360
i feel better about this or i feel worse

599
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,200
about the other

600
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,840
so option three is why don't we

601
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,880
retire a little bit and spend some time

602
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
creating our own framework to analyze

603
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,679
proposals like this

604
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,360
and that is draw up a list of what the

605
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,280
rsos believe a good model should look

606
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,840
like and then use that

607
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,960
list

608
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
to develop a structured dialogue at

609
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,960
least that way you can create an agenda

610
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
and go through things one step at a time

611
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,960
and option three is precisely what was

612
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,480
chosen

613
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,640
now this wasn't

614
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
what we thought would happen when we

615
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,039
started the discussions but the end

616
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,640
result was two new rsac publications

617
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
arsako 58 success criteria for the rss

618
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,720
governance structure 21 pages long and

619
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
an accompanying recommendation for

620
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,799
recommendations now one thing i should

621
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,000
emphasize

622
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,640
is that i'm i'm relatively new to the

623
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,080
icann governance universe but i'm told

624
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,440
that this is

625
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,880
pretty good

626
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,720
speed in terms of coming up with

627
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
something this complex

628
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,720
from the first informal discussions

629
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,600
among rsos to the final output which was

630
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,640
a unanimous 12-0 approval vote of both

631
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,240
rsac go58 and o59

632
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,559
and in a very formal sense by the root

633
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,640
service system advisory committee

634
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,480
more than 22 hours of meetings and

635
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,880
workshops spread out over 15 online

636
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,000
sessions

637
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,240
very well attended i mean we never had

638
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,080
fewer than 15 people in the room and a

639
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,320
few of them we had as many as 40. all

640
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,360
that was done and dusted and adopted in

641
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,000
seven calendar months which i'm told is

642
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
pretty speedy for something this

643
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,240
complicated but i have to say what made

644
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,559
it go that fast was the way that the

645
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,159
rsos

646
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,840
very quickly coalesced around some key

647
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,120
messages so

648
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,480
this went over the icann board and

649
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,320
immediately when they were published and

650
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
within a couple of days of publication

651
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,760
the icann board held a special session

652
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,000
and they said essentially this is a

653
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,400
shorthand yeah we like these

654
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,200
yeah

655
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,559
good going

656
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,400
and they transmitted those documents

657
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,159
with a covering note an endorsement a

658
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,799
bit of a guidance note sent it over to

659
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,200
our friends at gwg and said here here's

660
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,480
some documents

661
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,600
now i'll tell you more about what

662
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
happened with gwg at the very end of the

663
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,559
talk

664
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,000
before i do that i want to spend a

665
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,760
little time talking about what's

666
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,360
actually in

667
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,480
these success criteria or what is in

668
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,480
rsac058

669
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
first of all

670
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,679
the document implicitly acknowledges

671
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,720
a current reality that we can tease out

672
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,840
by asking this question is there an rss

673
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
governance structure

674
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,919
today

675
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,480
is there one right now to answer that

676
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,559
question let's look at the difference

677
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,919
between a technical standard and a

678
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,279
governance structure a technical

679
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,440
standard describes what technical

680
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
systems do a governance structure

681
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,400
describes what people are supposed to do

682
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,840
in other words a governance structure is

683
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,919
something that influences the behavior

684
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,000
of people and you ask yourself the

685
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,840
question is there something that

686
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,159
currently influences the behavior of the

687
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,960
people who run the root server system

688
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,559
and the answer is

689
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,400
yes it's a governance structure well

690
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,159
it's governance jim but not as we know

691
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,240
it

692
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,200
what does it look like

693
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,840
if you look at our sakura 58 section 1.2

694
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,360
you will find this

695
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,520
recitation of a history of governance

696
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,080
success the root server operators acting

697
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,919
under three conditions

698
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,960
acting collectively with each other

699
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,880
collaboratively with other stakeholders

700
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
while remaining independent those the

701
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,559
three conditions have had three

702
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,600
indicia of success have defined the core

703
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,120
principles that govern how the root

704
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,960
service should operate have delivered

705
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,240
the root service in accordance with

706
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,559
those principles and have served as a

707
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,000
group to maintain trust in the integrity

708
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,880
of

709
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,799
the service

710
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,840
that success can also be

711
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,520
expressed this way which it does in the

712
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,039
very next paragraph

713
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,520
says from the very early days of the dns

714
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,720
rsos have undertaken both an operational

715
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,360
and a collective governance role

716
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,159
in delivering the root service they've

717
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,720
worked to assure a stable single

718
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,440
internet by defending the principles

719
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,200
that make it successful against all who

720
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
threaten those

721
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,720
principles

722
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
and that ladies and gentlemen is the

723
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,559
very definition not just of a governance

724
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,320
structure but of a governance structure

725
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,360
that has up until now

726
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,520
been successful

727
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,200
24 hours a day

728
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,679
365 days a year

729
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,120
no interruptions

730
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,520
to the root server system

731
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,760
so looking to a governance future the

732
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,000
document then sets out this position the

733
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,159
continuing status

734
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,000
of rsos

735
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,880
as autonomous independent entities with

736
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,520
a significant voice in governance

737
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,120
remains an important principle for the

738
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,520
success of the governance structure no

739
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,279
definition of what a significant voice

740
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,960
means that's for the next set of

741
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,320
discussions to take place we're

742
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,399
establishing the principle so when you

743
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,840
look at the document and you think of

744
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
the process of establishing or creating

745
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,399
a new governance structure think of it

746
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,559
kind of like this if you begin with the

747
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,559
success criteria i mean the success

748
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,159
criteria clearly aren't the real

749
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,399
beginning it's more like rsac o37 and

750
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,919
even that's not the real beginning you

751
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,840
go all the way back to um

752
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,159
to john postel for the you know and paul

753
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,320
marketpetries for the real beginning but

754
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
we begin today with the success criteria

755
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,159
we then produce what are sacco 58 calls

756
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,440
the rss gs functional description

757
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,919
or to borrow language from the gwg what

758
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,240
they call the model

759
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,320
once you conclude once you have a

760
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,080
functional description once you have a

761
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,919
model that works that people are on

762
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,039
board with you then translate that into

763
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,360
constitutional documents i don't know

764
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,720
what they're going to be

765
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,120
contracts memorandum of understanding a

766
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,840
corporate charter shareholders agreement

767
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,240
heaven knows and we will let other

768
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,640
people figure that out downstream

769
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,799
as you settle and conclude those

770
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,799
constitutional documents eventually

771
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,720
reach the point of agreement and

772
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,880
signatures will there be signatures i

773
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
certainly hope so to be nice and sign

774
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
something but there will be a defined

775
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
end point where yeah that's it it's

776
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,039
crystallized that's what it has all the

777
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,799
rules are laid out everything's

778
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,919
completed and ready to go and then

779
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,440
we see a transition to the new structure

780
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,360
so how are these success criteria laid

781
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,120
out now by now i suspect that there will

782
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,399
be at least 10 of you who've already

783
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,919
downloaded this document you're reading

784
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,840
the document rather than listening to me

785
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,679
that's fine i've been doing this for a

786
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,760
long time i teach graduate students in

787
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,919
cyber security so i'm lucky if even half

788
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,200
of them are listening to me at any given

789
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
time so god bless you go on do whatever

790
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,480
you want to do so when you look at the

791
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,399
document what you're going to find is

792
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,240
the success criteria broken up into

793
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,399
three categories

794
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,960
the largest category by far are the

795
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,000
substantive criteria section a that deal

796
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,399
with rights and responsibilities

797
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,360
that deal with checks and balances

798
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,520
section b is about transition process

799
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,600
about maintaining stability of the route

800
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,440
even during transition define when

801
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,080
transition starts and section three is

802
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,640
what i call the clear statement criteria

803
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,799
and that is basically all of them exist

804
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,880
for one purpose make the functional

805
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,360
descriptions sufficiently detailed to

806
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,679
move everyone forward and let's avoid

807
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,919
all of this we'll figure that out later

808
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,159
or we'll give it to some sort of super

809
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,399
powerful individual who will arbitrarily

810
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,840
decide all those questions at some

811
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,000
future date we want to avoid that oh

812
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
let's push everything downstream let's

813
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,880
make hard decisions now

814
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,279
so when looking at them as well

815
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,039
the one thing that makes these very very

816
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,880
different from success criteria you may

817
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,120
have seen in other projects

818
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,760
or perhaps not is that there is no

819
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,919
guarantee that all of them will be

820
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,120
completely fulfilled

821
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
there's a balance to be struck here in

822
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,520
fact some of these success criteria you

823
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,840
could argue uh successfully are in

824
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
tension with each other the obvious the

825
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,480
a.1 criteria about accountability and

826
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
transparency on one hand

827
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,720
and the a.2 criteria which talk about

828
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,039
rso autonomy and independence on the

829
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,880
other well clearly autonomy and

830
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,240
independence are great but if you're

831
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,360
going to have accountability and

832
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
transparency autonomy and independence

833
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,960
have to have limits

834
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
but you if our accountability and

835
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,720
transparency are great but also you have

836
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,320
to have autonomy and independence so how

837
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
do we balance these various criteria

838
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,360
against each other that requires

839
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,600
negotiation

840
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,039
so now i just want to take you through a

841
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,559
few highlights and you can read these

842
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,080
things at your leisure but i did want to

843
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,760
call out a couple of them that are sort

844
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,919
of interesting or a little unusual

845
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,519
one of the one of the interesting ones

846
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,519
a.1.1.1

847
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,519
was

848
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,360
introduced the governance structure must

849
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,200
include provision for cyber incident

850
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,960
oversight and disclosure obligations

851
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,799
codify security threat and vulnerability

852
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,399
information sharing

853
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,640
um this came in because there was a

854
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,720
strong desire expressed

855
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,480
in the process of discussing this said

856
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,120
you know look we need to find a way to

857
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,360
formalize security incident reporting

858
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,600
and security management we might as well

859
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,919
collectively pull ourselves together and

860
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,600
get that right

861
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,720
let's concentrate that into some part of

862
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,320
the governance structure so that we're

863
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,159
all operating to a common standard hmm

864
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,760
why did rob spend the first part of this

865
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,039
talk talking about nis 2

866
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,600
because of course we are all concerned

867
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,279
that if the european union can think of

868
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,440
this everybody else can as well so we

869
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,200
want to be ready with an answer to the

870
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,360
question how do you actually deal with

871
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,640
this kind of issue 8.1.1.1

872
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,600
in the financial function a.3

873
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,279
a.3.4 is one of my favorites frankly

874
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,279
methods of raising funds to support the

875
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,600
root server system should to the extent

876
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,840
practical preserve the status of the rss

877
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,159
as a public good

878
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,600
made available for no charge at point of

879
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,399
use the rsos i mean

880
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,080
right now the rsos don't get paid to

881
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,159
provide the root server system they

882
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,240
don't there's no way to charge for it

883
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,399
and we don't want to charge for it uh

884
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,399
that's what i heard everybody say and i

885
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,679
know that my company doesn't want to

886
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,159
either but nonetheless it's expensive it

887
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,480
costs money to run so there needs to be

888
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,640
a funding mechanism but what we're all

889
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
unified around is the idea that whatever

890
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,960
the funding mechanism is it can't be

891
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,640
some ridiculous system where we're

892
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,159
charging everybody who looks up the

893
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,159
directory you know a hundredth of a

894
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,919
penny for every lo we're not we're not

895
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,320
doing micro pay this is not what we want

896
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,399
we want the root server system to

897
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,120
continue as a public good

898
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,080
similarly a34 the governance body

899
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
if it's going to be a governance body

900
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,159
it has to operate on a not-for-profit

901
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,519
basis

902
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,240
and also an interesting one that some

903
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,440
people might not appreciate a37

904
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
while the governance system must provide

905
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,200
opportunities to finance street server

906
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,600
operators there must be no obligation to

907
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,399
accept those sources of funding some

908
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,159
root server operators might be

909
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,960
constitutionally unable to accept

910
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,799
third-party sources of funding and some

911
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,440
of them might just might not want it

912
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,840
so you know again it's a it's an

913
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,159
interesting point that that this came up

914
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,840
that that people asked for this

915
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,200
protection in the success criteria list

916
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,440
last couple of points here under b1

917
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
transition is conditional on prior

918
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,199
settlement of constitutional documents

919
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,119
it's just kind of a way of saying we

920
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,599
can't kick the can down the road

921
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,679
to make the really hard decisions if

922
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,520
we're going to transition to a new

923
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,280
system you've got to get all the rules

924
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,639
you've got to get it settled you've got

925
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,320
to get it sorted

926
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,679
whatever the documents are going to be

927
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,280
get them all lined up and get them all

928
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,040
agreed checks and balances need to be

929
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,719
clear before we have a new structure in

930
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,560
force

931
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,359
and we must

932
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,359
over everything else

933
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,280
make sure

934
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,159
that

935
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,280
the root

936
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,960
servers remain

937
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,679
stable during whatever transition period

938
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,879
comes

939
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,399
that is

940
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,599
critical

941
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,359
to the entire internet

942
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,560
to the world

943
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,760
and that's why it's in the success

944
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,359
criteria my last slide here it is

945
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,960
you've been waiting a long time for this

946
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,000
so here's the last slide

947
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,839
are the next steps well i told you the

948
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,680
icann board said hey love these

949
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,880
documents

950
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
sent them to the rss governance working

951
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,640
group

952
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,040
the gwg on the 2nd of december at their

953
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,280
meeting accepted both of those documents

954
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,280
into their work plan

955
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,960
and then after that meeting was over or

956
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,160
during the meeting i can't remember

957
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,680
which they

958
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
basically asked for

959
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,800
comments

960
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
from all the rsos

961
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,760
on

962
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,119
possible changes to how the gwg was

963
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,640
structured

964
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,720
and those comments were made and thought

965
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,680
about

966
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,839
and on the 17th of january the

967
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,440
governance working group transmitted a

968
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,920
letter to the icann board

969
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,280
asking the icann board to amend the gwg

970
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,880
charter in two very important ways

971
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,560
amendment number one

972
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,320
invite all 12 rsos to the table

973
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,480
to continue this discussion

974
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,160
which is now being built around rsac o58

975
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,200
and amendment number two change the gwg

976
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,839
decision making procedures because

977
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,320
the original decision making procedure

978
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,800
was decide by consensus if you can but

979
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,560
if you can't you can decide by simple

980
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,520
majority and amendment number two is no

981
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,760
let's make this like so many other

982
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,240
things in the multi-stakeholder process

983
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,839
let's make this a consensus issue

984
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,400
only

985
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,720
and with that i will be very happy to

986
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,520
take your questions

987
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,240
excellent presentation thank you rob

988
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,800

again i encourage everybody in the room

991

and

992
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,879
on our platform online to ask questions

993
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,560
hello oh sorry

994
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,640
hello uh patrick gilmore deep edge

995
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,599
realty

996
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,400
um

997
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
your last slide move to consensus can

998
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,040
you define consensus is that unanimous

999
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,480
or 11 out of 12 or

1000
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,359
can

1001
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,760
can you define consensus that's uh well

1002
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,040
is it sort of like that's sort of like

1003
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,320
going to law school and saying can you

1004
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,960
define reasonable um so no it can be

1005
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,720
done but you might not like the answer

1006
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,040
uh the i mean the

1007
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,440
it's a request that's been made and

1008
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,240
various icann governance forum for uh

1009
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,320
have different definitions

1010
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,079
of the meaning of consensus but i

1011
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,920
believe the nature of the request was by

1012
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,119
consensus we mean uh there's there's

1013
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,800
nobody dissenting in other words

1014
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,720
everyone's got to be aligned as i

1015
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,040
believe the request that was made

1016
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,359
i'm speaking from memory here i can

1017
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,200
occasionally use as other definitions of

1018
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,920
consensus which basically boils down to

1019
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,040
it's

1020
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,440
it's uh almost everyone is aligned in

1021
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,599
other words if there's only one sore

1022
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,320
thumb sticking out then we'll call that

1023
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,520
almost

1024
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,599
consensus or nearly consensus i can't

1025
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,800
remember the precise term of art that

1026
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,880
they use but like i say gwg has

1027
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,480
requested that change to the charter but

1028
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,920
i don't know if icann board has

1029
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,560
responded yet to that request

1030
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,799
thank you

1031
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,800
okay we're waiting for more questions

1032
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,720
i'm going to go with the next rob can

1033
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,320
you expand on

1034
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,000
you mentioned making those root servers

1035
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,440
more secure i can give some examples of

1036
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,839
what would that look

1037
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,079
like uh well the security criteria that

1038
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,040
i mentioned um was uh

1039
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,280
well first let me let me

1040
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
caveat this if you want sort of like

1041
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,119
technical answers to technical questions

1042
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,520
all of you need to find ray bellis who's

1043
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,359
there in texas who runs f root for us

1044
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,359
and just drag him to a bar and buy him

1045
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,800
plenty of beers i'm sure he'll answer

1046
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,079
all of your technical questions because

1047
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,440
he loves talking to people hey ray

1048
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,320
the

1049
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,839
in terms of the question about security

1050
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,400
and the success criteria that's

1051
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
mostly about coordinating reporting

1052
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,160
uh of incidents and sharing information

1053
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,920
so in terms of what that would look like

1054
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,800
i i can't prejudge it but the the the

1055
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,119
kind of idea was if we're going to have

1056
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,640
a governance structure fruit server

1057
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,920
operators if there's going to be

1058
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,320
something sitting at the center

1059
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,160
that sort of like monitors coordinates

1060
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,560
liaisons does all of that then this

1061
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,200
would be a really good time to create

1062
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,599
some type of a centralized coordinated

1063
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,280
reporting authority

1064
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,960
for all of the route servers what will

1065
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,560
that look like i've no clue

1066
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,320
gotcha any mentioned

1067
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,200
security management and reporting is it

1068
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,800
the expectation now that those things

1069
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,400
will start happening to where there is a

1070
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,839
unified way of doing reporting is that

1071
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,640
on the horizon do you see the operators

1072
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,320
embracing that and following those

1073
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,920
guidelines

1074
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,400
well the root server operators

1075
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
lined up behind these particular success

1076
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,440
criteria unanimously 12-0 and when this

1077
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,560
issue was discussed there was really no

1078
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,960
dissension in the room

1079
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,440
with the idea that we need to find a way

1080
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,280
to address this now agreeing that we

1081
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,119
need to find a way to address this and

1082
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,720
we need to find a mechanism that does

1083
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,680
this

1084
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,119
is not the same thing as agreeing

1085
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,200
precisely what the mechanism looks like

1086
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,119
but there is good will and there is

1087
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,599
unity of vision that we do have to put

1088
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,280
something together like this it's it's

1089
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,200
what we you know we there seems to be a

1090
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,599
strong unanimity behind the need and the

1091
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,720
desire to create it

1092
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,280
gotcha we have a question online will

1093
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,640
the process of moving to a new gs

1094
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,560
be revisited the next time something

1095
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,359
like

1096
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,480
un

1097
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,520
and this two happens again or is there a

1098
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,839
plan to revisit it regularly

1099
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,640
well

1100
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,800
the governance structures

1101
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,720
change over time i mean we're all

1102
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,200
familiar with governance structures both

1103
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,079
in public law and in private business

1104
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,079
that are modified or amended sometimes

1105
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,240
that amendment process comes naturally

1106
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,839
from within the group they decide that

1107
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,920
they want to change the rules of the

1108
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,560
game so to speak sometimes particularly

1109
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,880
in businesses you get an intervention a

1110
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,720
regulatory intervention that forces you

1111
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,560
to reconsider

1112
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,640
the approach that we've taken so far i

1113
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,599
think

1114
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,200
is in part designed to try to reduce

1115
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,800
the need for or the perceived

1116
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,680
desirability of

1117
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,880
intervention

1118
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,960
by sovereign states in other words

1119
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,200
as this seems to already be a part of

1120
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,560
the multi-stakeholder system and the

1121
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,319
multi-stakeholder system has already

1122
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,359
been more or less accepted by sovereign

1123
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,359
states as the way things should be done

1124
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,640
in this space

1125
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,440
um

1126
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,920
this gives me some comfort and i think

1127
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,760
gives the rso some comfort that we're

1128
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,400
moving down a pathway that sovereign

1129
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,040
states will at least know how to embrace

1130
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
gotcha another question from

1131
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,400
online

1132
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,319
online robert

1133
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,920
this is allowed to absorb obviously a

1134
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,319
lot of information does it still address

1135
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,680
the concern of keeping the rss

1136
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,520
out from under nation

1137
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,960
nation state control a group deciding it

1138
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,440
is governing itself doesn't preclude

1139
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,560
nation states from deciding they have a

1140
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,560
right to override that self-governance

1141
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,520
all right well

1142
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,040
okay then let's go let's flip in the

1143
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,960
other direction let's talk about the

1144
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,040
dramatic things that states have the

1145
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,720
power to do the nuclear meltdown

1146
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,040
scenarios i do this with my

1147
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,960
students in teaching jurisdiction a

1148
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,680
sovereign state has the

1149
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,839
regulatory authority to do all kinds of

1150
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:42,720
things

1151
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,560
and if the sovereign states of the world

1152
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,040
wanted to just completely jump into this

1153
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
space take over this that and the other

1154
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,720
thing and say we don't care you know we

1155
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,560
don't care about rsos we don't care

1156
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,200
about the rss we don't care but i can we

1157
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,720
don't care about icann it's like this is

1158
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,800
my country i'll do what i want with it

1159
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,400
um

1160
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,319
sure sovereign states are sovereign

1161
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,560
states they have armies they have money

1162
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,240
they have resources they have all kinds

1163
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,119
of things

1164
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,440
the trick is there's a reason they don't

1165
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,960
do that

1166
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,200
and i'm hoping that the reason they

1167
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,119
don't do that is because the

1168
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,000
multi-stakeholder system that exists is

1169
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,760
acting as

1170
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,960
a

1171
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,319
you know within bounds globally trusted

1172
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,599
mechanism

1173
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,880
to

1174
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,599
maintain

1175
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,280
some degree of

1176
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,720
high degree of interoperability and

1177
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,240
communication

1178
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,640
particularly at the standards level

1179
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,280
of the internet so if you want to talk

1180
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,440
about massive interventions

1181
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,839
i think that the rsos

1182
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:44,800
are

1183
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,119
particularly sensitive to this because

1184
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,720
if a state wanted to take over some part

1185
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,000
of the internet

1186
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
and if i were a regulator i suppose

1187
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,760
that's where i would start

1188
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,280
let me know i'll turn this around if i

1189
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,960
were a regulator if i were king of

1190
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,359
ruritania and i wanted to just split

1191
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,200
ruritania and internet away from

1192
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,119
everything else i think the quickest way

1193
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,400
to do it would be to pass a law that

1194
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,480
says ruritania no longer recognizes the

1195
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,400
root zone uh instead we have the

1196
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,839
ruritania root zone and we have a

1197
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,520
rotanian root server operator and if

1198
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,280
anybody doesn't point their dns resolver

1199
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,640
to this one we're gonna we're gonna take

1200
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,319
you out of your house and kill you

1201
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,839
um you know states have a lot of

1202
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,839
authority to do bad things

1203
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,880
um

1204
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,040
if that but

1205
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,280
so far with a couple of obviously

1206
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,200
dramatic exceptions

1207
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,640
that hasn't happened

1208
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,839
and god willing that will continue to

1209
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,720
not happen because god willing we will

1210
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,640
continue to get

1211
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,280
the multi-stakeholder balancing system

1212
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,319
right

1213
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,920
that's my hope and that's why that's why

1214
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,119
i think there's everything to play for

1215
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,880
in this process

1216
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,560
excellent thanks rob we are running out

1217
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,400
of time but one last question

1218
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,839
a good question is will the

1219
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,920
constitutional documents include a

1220
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,079
process for a change of hands

1221
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,560
of one of the root servers or for the

1222
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,200
retiring of a root server

1223
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,520
well they should because the process of

1224
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,680
changing hands or retiring or creating

1225
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,200
new root servers are specifically

1226
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,640
addressed in the success criteria

1227
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,200
themselves uh we spoke briefly about the

1228
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,400
need to

1229
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,119
um address the process of of of how

1230
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,119
that's done as well as the financial

1231
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,720
impact of how that's done so if you read

1232
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,960
the success criteria i hope they're not

1233
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,359
that difficult to read um

1234
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,040
you know that you'll get some sort of a

1235
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,640
flavor for that now in terms of how that

1236
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,160
will work in practice

1237
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,920
there's a lot of detail yet to be worked

1238
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,599
out and all of these criteria have to be

1239
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,000
balanced against one another

1240
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,400
awesome again this was a great q a rob

1241
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,839

1243
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,359
and now

1244
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,480
