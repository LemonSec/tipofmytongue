[Music]

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,680
at this time i'd like to introduce doug

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,240
midori who will presenting on

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,759
measuring rpki adoption with netflow

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,560
doug is a director of internet analysis

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,400
for kentic where he works on the

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,920
internet

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,720
infrastructure analysis prior to kentic

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,519
he was the lead analyst for oracle's

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,840
internet intelligence team formally

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,960
dying research in renesas this is doug's

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,440
sixth time presenting at nanag

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,280
doug's first nanog was in 2010 during a

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,120
lightning session

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,960
about accountability

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,040
importing censorship

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,360
know i'm sorry about accidentally

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,440
importing censorship

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,440
welcome back to nandog doug

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,039
we are certainly glad to have you with

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,079
us today

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,320
all right happy valentine's day now

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
so my name is uh

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,120
i'm sorry

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,160
yeah to you too thank you

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,280
uh so here's my valentine to nanag uh so

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,199
i'm doug midori as michael said uh this

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,320
is a

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
a talk that i put together with joe

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,799
snyder's out of fastly who

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,799
isn't with us today but he's over in the

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,880
netherlands and hopefully listening in i

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,520
believe he may be in the chat

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,119
if there are any questions

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,759
so this is our talk measuring rpki rov

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,640
adoption with netflow

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,240
so to get us started so where are we

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,439
with rpki rv adoption

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,159
so rpi still stands as the internet's

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,040
best defense against uh bgb hijacks

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,119
stemming from a routing

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,720
from typos

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,439
uh bgb mishaps other types of uh

44
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,399
routing uh mistakes origination leaks

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,360
but with that like any broad security or

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,759
distributed security mechanism requires

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,159
many individual actions in order to

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,720
to adopt and um

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
to deploy

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,119
this internet wide functionality and to

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,799
get at the outset of something like this

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,079
you have a couple you have a check under

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,600
the egg problem

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,560
of

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,719
why would anybody bother rejecting any

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,878
invalids if there are no if no one's

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,800
signing routes no there are no roads and

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
why bother creating any roads if there's

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,520
no

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,160
nobody's rejecting invalids

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,239
we're going to revisit that question

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,239
because in the last couple of years

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,560
there's been a lot of progress made here

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,520
so this is a so we have two sides of

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,720
this of what makes rpi work you have the

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,239
dropping of imbalance and nowadays

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,200
you've got

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
many tier one isps

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
have come out in the last few years that

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,280
are dropping in valids we have lumen

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
aurelion some other

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,920
tier ones that have yet to rebrand into

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,599
some

74
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,879
fun new name

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,720
and then according to this is a

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,360
screenshot from the nist rpi monitor

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,080
it's a website uh put on by nest that

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,400
tracks row creation has a lot of

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,920
different uh

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,159
dimensions that they uh

81
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,760
uh study

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,640
row

83
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,879
row creation a lot of it's temporal so

84
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,319
you can see what's happening over over

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,480
time the links at the bottom but the

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,840
thing i'm trying to highlight here is

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
that you know as a couple of years ago

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
we started to see an inflection point

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
and things started to change where the

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,519
yellow is how many b2b routes are in the

91
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,280
global routing table

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
that are without aro

93
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
so they are as far as rpi is concerned

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,319
unknown

95
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,879
uh and the green line is those that are

96
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,519
have a rowa and are presently routed in

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,799
a uh will be evaluated as as valid by

98
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,519
rpi and thirdly there's a red line it's

99
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,040
hard to see because it's just hugging

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
the x-axis and those are those routes

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,920
that are

102
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,120
persistently

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
invalid and it's a very very small

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
number but the point being is that as of

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,760
a couple years ago we started to see a

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,480
lot of movement um and this is just just

107
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,879
by counting uh routes from from bgp

108
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,319
so as i mentioned there's kind of two

109
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,319
steps uh to

110
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,000
filtering an invalid route which is the

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
objective you've got to have people

112
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,239
creating the roas in step one and you've

113
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,159
got to have people dropping the invalids

114
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,439
in step two

115
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,080
uh over in step one as far as evaluation

116
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,720
of progress uh we've got a couple of

117
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
resources i mentioned the nist page is

118
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
pretty neat

119
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,199
ripe's ripe stat tool has incorporated a

120
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,720
new little widget that

121
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,000
provides

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
rpi status by country there's a bunch of

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,520
different ways that you can look at it

124
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,199
has v6 v4 percentage absolute numbers

125
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,960
on the other side then it's an active

126
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,880
area of research and arguably it's a

127
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,400
harder thing to to uh try to assess

128
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,919
globally what are the networks that are

129
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,080
dropping in valids and there's a a lot

130
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,000
of different projects that go along

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,520
they're trying to study that

132
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,960
this talk is focused a little more on

133
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,479
the left-hand side something that maybe

134
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
we thought we were this was a solved

135
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,479
problem but i've got some new data that

136
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,400
i'd like to share that i think puts a

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,160
new perspective on where we stand here

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
so back to where we are back to roac

139
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,639
creation so going back to the nist stats

140
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
uh this is a graphic i pulled a few days

141
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
ago off the uh of the nist rpa monitor

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,160
and we're looking at this is v4 the big

143
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,520
graph is v4 uh routes how many are valid

144
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,880
versus uh not found or unknown

145
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,600
uh right now it's reporting 34.1 percent

146
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,240
of v4 bhp routes presently signed and

147
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,199
valid

148
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,440
uh if you were to pull up v6 it's going

149
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,320
to be about 32.6 either way it's about a

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,840
third and so it's

151
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
we're

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
it's about two to one unknowns to valids

153
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,000
and that's the uh those are the two main

154
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
categories because the other uh uh

155
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,759
either invalid

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,840
or we'll see and valid but covering

157
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
those are very very small uh categories

158
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,160
so it's a it's a fight between unknown

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,960
uh and valid and it's two to one

160
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,639
but the question is how much uh traffic

161
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
is safeguarded by that 34 34 or 32 for

162
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,120
v6 that's the question i'm interested in

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
and before we get into that

164
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,199
let me take a quick little detour uh to

165
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,360
something three years ago

166
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
a lifetime ago an attorney to go prior

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,880
to the pandemic

168
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,199
uh in back way back in 2019

169
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,720
my co-presenter

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
joe schneiders and paolo lacente while

171
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
joe was at ntt

172
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,560
they worked together to extend the

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
capability of the pma cct network

174
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,880
analytics tool to include a

175
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,160
functionality

176
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
to

177
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,199
incorporate rpki evaluation into netflow

178
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,440
and the chief objective here was to try

179
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,759
to put to rest the concern that dropping

180
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
invalids was going to disrupt important

181
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
customer traffic or at least allow a

182
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,319
user to investigate this

183
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,880
to determine on their own without going

184
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,479
ahead and starting to drop stuff you

185
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,000
could see what would be the impact

186
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,120
before you

187
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
do it and this was helpful for a lot of

188
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
companies who were on the fence to go

189
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,560
ahead and embrace this technology but at

190
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,639
the end of his uh he put in a long

191
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
note to uh nanog describing the work

192
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,280
that they did everybody can take can

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,120
benefit from this and i put out a

194
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,919
challenge to the chief uh um netflo

195
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
analytics platforms that they ought to

196
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,960
adopt this uh uh this this feature

197
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,039
because it could serve the public um in

198
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,560
a in a big way

199
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,199
so the challenge was extended uh kentic

200
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,840
accepted and in 2020 uh we incorporated

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,240
this into our network analytics platform

202
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
and it's a pretty cool feature

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
uh in fact a lot of this talk is going

204
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,360
to be about us stemming from our our

205
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
implementation of that feature

206
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,120
i don't know about the other company but

207
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
uh but but it's part been part of the

208
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,719
kentic platform for a couple years

209
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,680
so if we go one more month ahead in

210
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,400
march 2019 we're still in the ancient

211
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,879
past of a couple years ago

212
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,879
uh job gave a talk at dknog and 9

213
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,720
looking at you know having having built

214
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,080
this tool the pma cct tool with paolo

215
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
and now they were looking at ntt traffic

216
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
a pretty big network and trying to

217
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,360
assess like what does it look like from

218
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,240
ntt standpoint uh this is a graph out of

219
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,160
the um

220
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
uh out of that presentation and keep

221
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,280
this in mind because we're gonna see

222
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,039
some of these a newer version of this

223
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,360
kind of thing but as you can see i don't

224
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,440
have the percentages here but

225
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,599
the vast majority is unknown again we're

226
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,000
before that inflection point on the nist

227
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
graphic that i mentioned earlier and

228
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,080
if i had to guess

229
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
uh generously maybe that's 20 of valid

230
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,280
traffic this is by bits per second

231
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,879
and we've come a long way

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,719
since then

233
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,679
as a as an aside another another point

234
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,360
that job made was you know i had to

235
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
slide is a bit of a provocative title

236
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,760
maybe not everybody needs to do rpki

237
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,039
he's probably the world's chief

238
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,560
proponent of this but

239
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,720
his argument was due to the

240
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,560
consolidation and centralization of the

241
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
internet if we only were able to get

242
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
some major

243
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,399
content providers and major access

244
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,720
networks either networks maybe maybe

245
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
some dns service providers to implement

246
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,880
uh archicad drop invalid sign routes we

247
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
would have protected a lot of the

248
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,160
internet traffic and maybe we never get

249
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,000
out to the extremities so keep that in

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
mind because we're gonna see how this

251
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,839
ended up playing out

252
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,440
all right so why does kentic have any

253
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,560
perspective uh to add to this story so

254
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,160
kentic scott i'm not sure what the

255
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,560
current count is over 300 customers avi

256
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,920
can give us an update uh uh

257
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,440
what the what the number should be you

258
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
have about half of those have elected to

259
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
have allowed us to use uh some of the

260
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
flow data that they provide us

261
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839
in as part of aggregate analysis and so

262
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,760
when i if you follow me on twitter or

263
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
see some of the stuff i put in the media

264
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,560
when we're

265
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
writing up a blog about a military junta

266
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,480
and myanmar we're publishing a traffic

267
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
of

268
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,399
traffic falling off a cliff or ortonga

269
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,680
last month

270
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
we put something out with reuters

271
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,279
looking at the the effects of the

272
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,279
volcano and then the restoration

273
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,160
um

274
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,680
that's coming from this aggregate

275
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,200
netflow analysis that's where that comes

276
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,640
from

277
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,279
it's important to know also just from a

278
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,000
from a scientific standpoint that

279
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,720
there are biases in this data we have a

280
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,040
variety of types of customers of large

281
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,160
nsps cdns digital businesses but we do

282
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,880
have a sku towards the us so but i

283
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,360
despite those biases notwithstanding i

284
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
think the analysis still holds up that

285
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
there's a lot that we can learn from

286
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,839
this

287
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,959
so

288
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,000
back to the uh the feature that uh

289
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
kentic put together of

290
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,120
doing rpi evaluation upon intake of

291
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,200
netflow and again this originally was

292
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,519
built so we could for our customers help

293
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,000
them uh get off the fence about what

294
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,480
would be the impact of dropping invalids

295
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
but what's really cool for a guy for

296
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,760
analysts like me is that i can now use

297
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,920
uh this this functionality to explore

298
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,200
all kinds of things like we're going to

299
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,880
see in a minute

300
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
all right so what are the four

301
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,680
uh

302
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,519
cases that we're tracking as far as uh

303
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,040
rpi outcome

304
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,880
we're associating that we're assigning

305
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,440
um flows one of these four states this

306
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
is essentially the same states that were

307
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,360
that job and paolo have put into the pma

308
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,920
cct tool uh and so what's happening is

309
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
if it's a flow to a destination ip that

310
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
ip has got a bgp route if that route is

311
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,839
valid unknown invalid those are the uh

312
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,600
options that it's assigned there's also

313
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
this possibility of

314
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
uh it was to a route that was invalid uh

315
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,160
however uh there was a covering prefix

316
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,440
that was either valid or unknown you

317
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
wouldn't have dropped that had you been

318
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
dropping uh invalids and so therefore

319
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
you potentially could have

320
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,079
delivered it it was important to

321
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,519
job that i i emphasized that

322
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,640
state number four is not part of any itf

323
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
or bgp spec this is this exists solely

324
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,519
in the analysis plane

325
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,079
uh and on the right is an example of of

326
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,839
uh what this would look like so you've

327
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,240
got a slash 24 that's rpi invalid you

328
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,519
can see this is out of hurricane

329
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,560
electrics handy bhp.at.net website

330
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,880
little red key says that's uh that slash

331
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,240
24 is invalid would have been dropped

332
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,639
had you been uh rejecting invalids but

333
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,600
you

334
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,360
at least routing would have taken you

335
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,720
taken your packets onto the destination

336
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,639
uh with that uh covering prefix that was

337
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,720
valid with the green key

338
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,959
17.

339
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,399
all right

340
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,560
so we've established about a third of

341
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,920
the bgp routes either v4 or c v6 i've

342
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,399
got valid uh roas

343
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,800
how much traffic is that

344
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
all right so i took a period of analysis

345
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,720
i've run this many times but i settled

346
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,480
on this seven days ago just to

347
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,160
pick a pick a period of time and then

348
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,920
here are the main observations we saw

349
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
about you know less than a percent

350
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
that's invalid covering so this is kind

351
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,040
of inconsequential you if you were

352
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,240
dropping in values the traffic would

353
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,600
have been delivered anyway due to a

354
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,120
covering prefix

355
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,720
uh 42

356
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,639
unknown

357
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,959
and fifty six point four percent

358
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,959
valid and so i'm going to use this the

359
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,040
term if you will if you'll permit me

360
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,839
valid traffic that's flows going to a

361
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,160
route that would have been evaluated as

362
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
uh archetype valid uh we're seeing the

363
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,440
majority of traffic uh globally just we

364
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
pull it all up uh traffic going to any

365
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
destination it's going to a valid route

366
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
that is a big difference from what job

367
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
was presenting three years ago

368
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,760
and then we've got a tiny amount that's

369
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,440
invalid again

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,760
uh not a reason to not drop val in

371
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,160
ballads

372
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
all right so i mentioned the swipe stat

373
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,760
widget with the rpi um

374
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
functionality and we're gonna use that

375
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,839
to take a tour a little around the world

376
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:36,800
uh

377
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,519
uh of what what does this look like um

378
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,600
with country level stats

379
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,279
i mean why don't we start we're here in

380
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,600
the us we'll look at the us so if we

381
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
looked at v4 v6 based on the right stat

382
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,519
tool i think it would look the same if

383
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,880
you were to pull this up right now we're

384
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,040
at 24 20 percent a distinct minority of

385
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,320
the routes

386
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,920
with the way ripest does it it's not

387
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,760
counting pgp routes it's doing ip

388
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,680
address space that's that's fine i don't

389
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,600
have any problem with that

390
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,240
what we're seeing in netflow is 58.5

391
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
of uh this is in bits per second from

392
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,959
that flow combined v4 v6 it's a big

393
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,839
difference

394
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,160
um it's and it's a lot more it's a lot

395
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,519
more

396
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,839
and so why why is that well

397
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,000
good thing i've got a an analytics

398
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,079
platform to dig into this because

399
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,079
what ends up happening is

400
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,639
we're seeing the outcome of these major

401
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,040
rpki deployments

402
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,320
on the eyeball network side uh spectrum

403
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
charter and comcast are some of the

404
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,040
biggest uh eyeball networks in the u.s

405
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,399
we see traffic too

406
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,360
in fact if you stick around in two talks

407
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,279
tony tober from comcast is going to tell

408
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,399
the story of comcast's uh rpki

409
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,839
deployment which is going to be pretty

410
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,519
cool but we're seeing like almost all

411
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,120
traffic to these major networks in the

412
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,920
us

413
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
as a valid traffic traffic going to a

414
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,680
route that's

415
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,120
rpi valid

416
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,399
on the flip side of that content

417
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
providers google and amazon we're seeing

418
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,519
100 may push a ton of traffic cloudflare

419
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,639
also very high not quite 100 but

420
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,320
these networks both these eyeball and

421
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
content networks may not account for a

422
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,399
majority of bgb routes

423
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,600
but they do

424
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
account for a lot of traffic it's not

425
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,600
58.8 it's 50 58.5 but it's pushing a lot

426
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,160
it's pushing that number up out of those

427
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,959
smaller uh percentages for v4 and v6

428
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,360
space

429
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
so i won't

430
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
ask you to read this thing but we went

431
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,959
and looked at you know what's the top 20

432
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,279
or so countries how does it how do these

433
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,199
stats work for other countries

434
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,519
and so if we take a little tour

435
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,839
around the world uh the the numbers are

436
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
all over the map as the countries are

437
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,120
so

438
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,560
we mentioned to the u.s these are the

439
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,639
numbers we just saw a moment ago

440
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,880
uh canada brazil they both look so in

441
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,720
these these colors here the blue is the

442
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,240
bits per second coming from netflow

443
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,480
combined v4 v6

444
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,240
again we saw 58 58 in bits per second um

445
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,160
a majority of traffic distance to the

446
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,800
united states is now going to uh routes

447
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
with valid roas

448
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,399
um

449
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,199
uh orange is v uh is v4 a gray is v6

450
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,279
uh mexico is one of those few uh

451
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,320
countries that goes actually in the

452
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,560
other direction uh that there's there's

453
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,040
maybe more uh routes than we see traffic

454
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,680
for again potentially could be a bias of

455
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,279
ours but um

456
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,800
if we look at europe we have a lot we

457
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,959
have a lot of countries here

458
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,680
with turkey uh as

459
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,839
one of the top countries that have done

460
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,560
major rpi deployments and most of these

461
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,959
stats kind of track with each other uh

462
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,120
so we see mostly before space covered in

463
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
turkey and most of the traffic going uh

464
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,399
there is valid traffic maybe the biggest

465
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,639
difference in this set in europe is

466
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,680
probably the uk uh listed as gb here

467
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,320
we're seeing uh you know v4 uh

468
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,360
percentages at like 30 something percent

469
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
and then the uh um

470
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,399
uh the percent of traffic to to the uk

471
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,000
at 56.1 percent again the the netflix

472
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,480
looks a lot better than the ip address

473
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,599
space

474
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,880
um

475
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,400
if we go over to asia plus australia um

476
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,559
discuss some we have wide extremes here

477
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,760
so taiwan and the philippines have got

478
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,880
massive rpk deployments that's evident

479
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,799
in either metric

480
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,400
and on the other side of

481
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,079
the spectrum you've got china and south

482
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,280
korea again both have like almost none

483
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,039
by any metric

484
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,320
hopefully one day

485
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,280
we can address that

486
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,600
so there's a lot of if you have netflow

487
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,880
to play with there's other dimensions

488
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,480
you can kind of explore

489
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,840
i'll just go through these because

490
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,679
they're kind of interesting so

491
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,440
one of those is that you know we we

492
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,240
typically by default merge our v4 v6

493
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,080
drop it together but you can always pull

494
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,640
that back apart and we're seeing

495
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,120
a much higher percent of valid traffic

496
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,160
traffic to

497
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,600
valid routes in bits per second for v6

498
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,960
and v4

499
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,559
i've got some theories on that if you've

500
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,919
got some step up to the mic at the end

501
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,240
of this talk and let me hear them

502
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,360
because there's these are some

503
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,440
interesting observations in my mind uh

504
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,120
if you go by port

505
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
we see very high

506
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,400
uh valid traffic stats for port 443 i

507
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,720
think that probably comes back to the

508
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,960
uh those content providers uh deploying

509
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,919
rpki and now they're pushing up port 80

510
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,000
but you know we can we can go we can go

511
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
a lot of dimensions here

512
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,039
one of the things that i noticed in

513
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,440
playing around with the rpki i sorry the

514
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,919
ripe stat widget is that you know

515
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,440
they've got a neat thing another like

516
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,559
the nist

517
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,400
website it's got a temporal dimension so

518
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,320
you can see what was what was some

519
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,640
dimension uh changes over time and so

520
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,799
this is an example from poland i mean i

521
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,480
remember what what what carrier it was

522
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
but they at the end of september had a

523
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,960
big

524
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
archive deployment

525
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,919
um and if we look at v6 by percentage

526
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,039
they recover going from 39 of ip address

527
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,520
space covered to 64 percent when we pull

528
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,640
up our data i can see the same of

529
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,960
a similar movement it's not exactly one

530
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,039
to one but the movements are correlated

531
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,919
as we're going from 46 percent to 60 in

532
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,400
bits per second again combined v6 v4

533
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,840
um another thing that maybe is an

534
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,400
important uh study to

535
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,640
our event to be aware of is that there

536
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,480
was a taiwan nick outage in september

537
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
it was such an outage that for a brief

538
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,799
period of time no one on earth was able

539
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,919
to evaluate an rpi

540
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,000
routes from taiwan

541
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,919
and there's always a lot of concern and

542
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,840
handwriting around this kind of scenario

543
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,000
of that would this cause an outage the

544
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
technology's been built to fail open uh

545
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,440
but

546
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,520
uh be that as a may there's still

547
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,039
lingering concerns so here's a here's a

548
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,080
case of a of an outage of our outage um

549
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,760
and from our standpoint when i dug into

550
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,919
this i could find no uh disruption to

551
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,919
traffic and our system was just

552
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,919
dutifully as as the um caches uh as the

553
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,400
um yeah the cache is timed out we

554
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,720
reclassified all the traffic volume from

555
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,960
valid uh to unknown and then when it

556
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,360
came back on from unknown back to valid

557
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,120
and like nothing ever happened you can

558
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,200
see there's a diurnal pattern there of

559
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,600
traffic going into taiwan and um it was

560
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,919
a non-event as far as traffic goes and

561
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,039
that's a that's a good sign

562
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,360
other kind of weird phenomenon if you

563
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,240
keep playing with it you can keep

564
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,080
finding more stuff uh you know these

565
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
routes in the course of a day don't

566
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,559
change that much but these percentages

567
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,200
still change a little bit there's a a

568
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,360
little undulation going throughout the

569
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,960
day

570
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,000
we see a high around 200 utc 57

571
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,919
valid traffic down to

572
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,280
0 200

573
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,880
at 54 and this kind of shifts every day

574
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
i've got these marked out with little

575
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
arrows and this has more to do with user

576
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
behavior obviously the network

577
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,200
infrastructure stays the same for the

578
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,960
most part during the day

579
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,200
and i mentioned those massive

580
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,919
deployments for comcast charter spectrum

581
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,679
uh that are are big sources of of

582
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,960
um

583
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,280
fixed line connectivity but in the

584
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,120
mobile space in the united states we

585
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,880
still have a long way to go uh there's

586
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,440
some deployments in 18t verizon not so

587
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,159
much

588
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,080
and so when we switch when users are

589
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,919
switching from their fixed line devices

590
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,760
to the phones primarily and they're

591
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,320
going back and forth it's it's it's

592
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,559
shifting the volume of traffic of what's

593
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,440
going

594
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,919
to uh either valid or unknown again the

595
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,480
two main states that we see in rpki

596
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
all right so uh

597
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,799
here are our um

598
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,840
best practices uh put together mostly

599
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,760
from job so do sign that do sign routes

600
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
there are major carriers that are

601
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,960
filtering and that's going to protect

602
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,240
your routes

603
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,480
uh do reject

604
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,280
rpg valids and what by doing this you

605
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,840
are likely if this analysis holds up

606
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,159
and it's uh similar to what your network

607
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,159
is experiencing it's going to protect a

608
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,559
majority of your outbound traffic

609
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,159
against bgb hijacks due to typos

610
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,520
other mishaps like origination leaks

611
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,799
again

612
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,760
we feel this is not a risk to legitimate

613
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
traffic but don't take my word for it

614
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,799
you've got the pma cct tool where you

615
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,200
can run an evaluation on your own and

616
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,080
you can also do a trial with kentic pipe

617
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,679
your flow in and go and do your own

618
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
analysis so you don't need to take my

619
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,799
word for it you can you can study this

620
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,280
very easily on your own

621
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,679
on the do not

622
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,960
it's highly discouraged to be modifying

623
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,679
uh either local pref or bgb communities

624
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,679
based on validation states and here's

625
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,200
why so last year there were a couple of

626
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,280
vulnerabilities that surfaced around uh

627
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,640
validators

628
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,960
in it you could

629
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,039
send some bad information into a

630
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,039
validator causing it to crash

631
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,039
uh it's been that's been addressed and

632
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,840
fixed but uh the downstream impact is

633
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,480
that if you had a very large network

634
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,200
that was changing communities or um

635
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,880
maybe less so of an effect of changing

636
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
local pref based on

637
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,400
uh validation states and you're sharing

638
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,919
this out to the internet maybe it's okay

639
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,960
if you keep it within your network but

640
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,159
if this is going out to the internet

641
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,159
it's going to cause all your routers to

642
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,520
everything that's valid is gonna have to

643
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,760
re-issue that re-announce that announce

644
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
the route

645
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,080
with a new state now it's unknown

646
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,480
because it lost all its ability to

647
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,600
access to see a validator

648
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,679
that has the potential to create a ton

649
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,679
of messages at one time and it could be

650
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,600
disruptive at least uh causing some

651
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,120
instabilities

652
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,880
uh job's gotta

653
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,600
reject invalids guide uh if you have any

654
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,480
questions and um

655
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,679
like i said if you have any questions

656
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,400
about archicad or this analysis reach

657
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,120
out to the bgba team that's job's uh

658
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,559
moniker uh that the team consists of me

659
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,960
job and job's cat

660
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,720
i have a cat too he didn't make the team

661
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,320
all right and we have any questions

662
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,720
we have oh two online okay

663
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,279
since jeff was the first one to post to

664
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,919
go to him first jeff houston says let me

665
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,320
rephrase the question sorry is the flow

666
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,480
data looking at traffic

667
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,679
so

668
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,000
esters to the clients

669
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,760
it looks like the server to the client

670
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,720
data and the issue is that it seems to

671
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,279
be more critical to be protecting the

672
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,760
route servers not the client's routes

673
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,279
comments doug huh uh the route

674
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,080
yeah

675
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,240
the route servers

676
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,440
sorry where is it right here

677
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,480
traffic to s

678
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,200
sd certificate servers to clients

679
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,919
i mean this is this is traffic egressing

680
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,880
uh the um

681
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,840
uh the the flow from the customers so it

682
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,440
can either be going

683
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,120
i mean we've got

684
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,760
access level access layer networks as

685
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,640
well as um

686
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,440
content providers so i guess

687
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,360
it's it's just destination flow

688
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,679
so i don't know if i all right sorry

689
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,000
the next question or comment comes from

690
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,520
randy bush huh a valid 17 trump's an

691
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,679
invalid 24

692
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,120
and the announcement is in the 24.

693
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,080
yeah so that was the slide about um

694
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
if you were to drop a if you have a if

695
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,159
you drop a valve so in that i gave that

696
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,960
example of a slash 24

697
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,279
um that's the case for

698
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,320
yeah case four uh that's not in the spec

699
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,559
job um of anything

700
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
uh so if you were to drop that 24 can

701
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,000
you still do you still have a route to

702
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,120
deliver the uh the uh the ip if there's

703
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,039
still a slip 17 that's a covering then

704
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,559
yes i don't maybe i don't understand

705
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,840
what's controversial about that one

706
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,039
you know while you're digging up another

707
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,360
question i think a question of i might

708
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,799
ask myself where i came up i gave a

709
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,000
little presentation to this a little

710
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,159
preview to the the this team that makes

711
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,240
does their um doug montgomery and his

712
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,919
team and uh you know

713
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,960
uh a point he made was we're emphasizing

714
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
um

715
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,159
there's a conceit here that a route is

716
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,159
more important uh

717
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,720
that if it's got more traffic um

718
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
and that's not always the case there are

719
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,360
some routes that uh are very important

720
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,960
that don't maybe they don't have no

721
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,720
traffic but they don't have uh it's not

722
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,679
a ton of traffic uh the example would be

723
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,320
a traffic queries going to like a dns

724
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,720
authoritative uh server uh and so we've

725
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,600
seen uh cases where there's hijacks that

726
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,240
um that uh deliberately go after uh the

727
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,440
rapid three hijack go after

728
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,400
authoritative servers um and and so they

729
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,640
are they are the dns world is very

730
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
important but maybe not as uh traffic

731
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,120
intensive as something like video so

732
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,840
that's a that's a valid critique got one

733
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,240
more question from tony lee if an

734
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,360
invalid more specific causes disruption

735
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,199
would that be an attack vector

736
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,919
let's see if an invalid more specific

737
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,200
causes disruption i guess the idea is if

738
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,880
it was an invalid

739
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,159
you would be dropping it

740
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,279
causes more destruction would be an

741
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,640
attack vector

742
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,919
i don't know if i quite understand that

743
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:42,960
one

744
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,840
i don't know obviously

745
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,600
well just as a reminder to people just

746
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,760
learning or pki this is origin

747
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,840
validation not path validation that's

748
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
true so if you

749
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,320
could

750
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,679
originate

751
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,640
as whoever is actually signing it

752
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,520
and

753
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,200
you know the path is i'm not actually

754
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,679
that is i'm just taking that as in vain

755
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,360
then that would be an attack vector but

756
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,840
yeah i think in general in theory that's

757
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,279
the point is

758
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,640
that it would be dropped you know

759
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,159
because it doesn't validate if you're

760
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,000
you know if you're using rpki if you're

761
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,320
validating rpki right and so if you

762
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,679
wanted to be evil

763
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,279
i could take your as in vain and then

764
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,039
origin validation doesn't necessarily so

765
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,799
this is why there's there's a there's a

766
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,799
lot of uh thought going into some of the

767
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,840
wording choices of uh you know i think

768
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,279
in this space we call it the determined

769
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,520
adversary the scenario the obvious like

770
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,600
could you uh with a with some

771
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,480
sophistication defeat the the mechanism

772
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,799
as stands and the answer is yes so right

773
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,399
now we're just trying to this is where

774
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,600
we're at with reality security we're

775
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,760
trying to just reduce or eliminate the

776
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,880
bonehead mistakes the fat fingers the

777
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
screw-ups because we've got plenty of

778
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,080
those and then we're going to move up

779
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,760
the stack as as we go but

780
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,679
um

781
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,240
we have one more from bruno i'm not even

782
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,440
go for the last name on it

783
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,799
oh thank you i think

784
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,880
uh there's some there are still lots of

785
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,720
sps at least in my country who believe

786
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,600
that our psl irr requirements for a

787
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,720
better internet is optional do you think

788
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,039
rpk ai will be

789
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,679
all around one day

790
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,960
uh

791
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,520
i think so i mean i think i think

792
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,320
so

793
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,880
uh better than so yeah

794
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,200
the world before rpi is a lot of

795
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
different uh

796
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
homegrown hatched together hacked

797
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,960
together uh methods of filtering that

798
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,320
have kind of you know

799
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,600
served its purpose but we've got a

800
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,799
better we've got better stuff

801
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,520
coming down the line and i i think the

802
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,279
at least the data that we're we're

803
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,640
seeing here things are moving in the

804
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,360
direction of adoption and um and i guess

805
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,520
i guess my my main point is uh now we

806
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,000
have a majority of traffic uh again this

807
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,559
analysis holds up this is uh this is

808
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,960
what we're seeing as far as um

809
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,440
we have a lot of traffic that's now um

810
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,360
at least signed so now we just need the

811
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,919
rest y'all to drop drop the invalids to

812
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,080
complete the circle we have 40 seconds

813
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,440
left i got one more here from aaron

814
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,840
aaron weintraub yep thank you um is

815
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,600
there any research being done

816
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,720
during rpk outages to see if people are

817
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,440
taking advantage of these outages

818
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,200
uh that's a good question i've tried to

819
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
do there's been a couple of rpi outages

820
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,440
in the past uh when i was uh i guess at

821
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,640
oracle there was one there was a

822
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,320
afroneck outage i remember digging in

823
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,080
trying to see like kind of maybe they

824
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,440
answered this was it was anybody taking

825
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,039
advantage of this uh the only thing i

826
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,520
could find was uh as far as like impact

827
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,360
in the global routing table is you've

828
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,640
got a bunch of routes that were uh

829
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,960
invalid that are now going to be uh

830
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,080
unknown and those had much lower

831
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,480
propagation rates and as soon as soon as

832
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,640
uh you don't you have no way to evaluate

833
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,399
them all sudden they're globally uh

834
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,840
routed when the system comes back up

835
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,880
they go they go back that was the only

836
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
uh it's really hard to

837
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,200
find um

838
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,840
to be certain to find a hijack

839
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
a lot of a lot of these hijacks require

840
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,960
some uh some a priority or outbound

841
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,559
information to know the context like

842
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,919
this one that just happened in south

843
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,760
korea you know if i were to stumble upon

844
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,440
that i wouldn't know that just strictly

845
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,000
from the routing to know that this was a

846
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,760
a very sophisticated hijack um

847
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,360
you you need some out of affirmation so

848
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,080
it's

849
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,840
it's not it's easier said than done to

850
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,120
find those kind of incidents it may have

851
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,640
happened

852
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,240
well thank you doug all right thanks a
