practical

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,959

at our nano conferences going forward

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
our con a code of conduct is important

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,200
it makes our attendees feel safe

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,560
it allows us to share ideas and work in

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
a community environment that's very

69
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,519
important to all of us

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,239
we

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,760
do not allow

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
aggressively pushing your services

73
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,560
distribution of alcohol other than

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,920

audio and video recordings of the

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
sessions that where recordings are not

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,959
permitted in those cases that's because

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,000
um

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,120
the speaker

80
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
you know has requested as such

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
or engaging any illegal activity

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
obviously

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
offensive verbal comments um sexual

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,959
orientation um gender identity

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,800
any comments regarding those things are

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,560
not acceptable

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
sexual images

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
deliberate intimidation and demeaning or

89
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,000
disruptive behavior all unacceptable we

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,599
want a very welcome opening um

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,760
an open community for all to feel

92
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,040
comfortable coming to the mic and

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,640
expressing their ideas

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,440
um

95
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
more of that no unwanted sexual

96
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
attention or appropriate physical

97
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,920
contact um these should all be givens in

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,200
our community

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,000
uh

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,519
and we want everybody to feel very

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,440
welcome at the socials as well as in

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,760
this environment the code of conduct and

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,040
applies to all of our events

104
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,760
we are introducing a nano ombudsman um

105
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,040
for

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,000
and the idea of this will be

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,360
that they will be a designated impartial

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
person at our meetings

109
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,959
they can provide conflict resolution

110
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,879
and be neutral

111
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,760
the idea being that they will if

112
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,238
somebody were to experience um some sort

113
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,160
of uh

114
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,120
bias slight comment something that they

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
did not feel comfortable dealing with or

116
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
wanted to report they could go to this

117
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,479
neutral person

118
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,160
but more than that the ombudsman is

119
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,520
going to give us feedback on our

120
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,040
meetings and what we could be doing to

121
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
improve and make our environment more

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
diverse and welcoming

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
uh

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,280
so

125
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,360
we will be introducing the actual

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,040
environment during the community meeting

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,560
as well they cover harassment

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,880
group conflicts confusion around

129
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,919
policies procedures ethical dilemmas

130
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,080
bullying all of these things

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
and we will have an ombudsman at all the

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,120
meetings going forward

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
i've hosted as cat said 10 times it used

175
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400
to be really hard we'd work down in

176
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
miami i think was the first time we'd

177
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,280
have spent two weeks busting our butts

178
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
pulling fiber or doing craziness trying

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,280
it already it's really kind of easy now

180
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,039
but it's still an honor to do this and

181
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,919
host things um i made a video because i

182
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,120
didn't know if i was gonna get covered

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
or not so we made a nice video and i got

184
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,639
to talk in my com josh voice which i

185
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,639
don't do very well so i had a big

186
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,560
microphone and i slowed it all down um

187
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
but what you're about to see is is

188
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,440
pretty neat it talks about quantum

189
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,360
loophole this is my time to do unabashed

190
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,560
marketing because i'm a sponsor and

191
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
you're stuck um code of contact code of

192
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,680
conduct aside to get the video um i will

193
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,360
give you one little caveat what you're

194
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,960
about to see and and talk about our

195
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,639
campus is pretty neat but to equate the

196
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,759
amount of power we're bringing to the

197
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,400
site it's 3 000 megawatts that's equal

198
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,240
to all of the energy produced on a daily

199
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,000
basis in the city of austin so this is

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
the 10th biggest city in the u.s all the

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
energy on a daily basis that's how big

202
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,840
our single campus is but guys it's movie

203
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,960
time everybody pay attention you get to

204
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,520
watch a movie

205
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
greetings and welcome everybody to nanog

206
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
in austin texas i'm proud to be the host

207
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
of nanak for more than 10 of all nanos

208
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,520
that have ever existed and with multiple

209
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
companies truly being a benefit to the

210
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,319
ecosystem that we give back to every day

211
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,000
thank you for attending it's really a

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,080
good thing that we can do this together

213
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
telling everybody about quantum loophole

214
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,199
is i'm sure important to you and i'm

215
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,479
sure you have a lot of questions about

216
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,120
what we're doing

217
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,120
quantum loophole is really a provider of

218
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,000
the elements of the data center business

219
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
we sell land to support data center

220
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,479
infrastructure and services

221
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,319
a hyperscaler or multi-tenant company

222
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,919
can come along or even an enterprise or

223
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,840
government entity could come along and

224
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
acquire a piece of land on our campus up

225
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,280
in frederick maryland

226
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,520
which is located just 20 miles from the

227
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,000
ashburn ecosystem i think we all kind of

228
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,599
agree the center of interconnection for

229
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,080
our community in north america

230
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
we will occasionally build a powered

231
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
shell if somebody really wants it but to

232
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,120
clear we are not in the multi-tenant

233
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,479
data center business we don't build

234
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,080
buildings and operate data centers

235
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
that's really for others to do we

236
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,159
provide those elements the pieces that

237
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,640
people really need

238
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
energy services are essential to what

239
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,919
people do in our business and on our

240
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,880
campus

241
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
being a former alcoa aluminum smelter

242
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,719
this site has access to massive

243
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,800
transmission scale power

244
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
we believe at full scale we'd be able to

245
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,600
do up to 3 000 megawatts on the campus

246
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
obviously depending on the density that

247
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,959
can go in there with liquid cooling and

248
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,640
other future technologies we have

249
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
entitlement to deliver up to 28 million

250
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,240
square feet of data center space on the

251
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
campus with the entities and other data

252
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
center providers who acquire land from

253
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,839
us it's our job to make sure that we can

254
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,080
support them with energy services

255
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
it is also essential to look for future

256
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,160
technologies for backup power services

257
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,839
diesel generators at the scale of what

258
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,279
we're doing and what we're building

259
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,959
really aren't tenable

260
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,640
moving away from fossil fuels and being

261
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,399
a transmission scale power allows us to

262
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,800
work towards a future technology for

263
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
battery storage or even compressed air

264
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,320
energy storage or pumped hydro

265
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,200
and other variations of that

266
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
that means we can start really focusing

267
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,080
on the future of the internet and being

268
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,880
completely sustainable

269
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,399
another large thing that quantum mobile

270
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,560
does is water services we have up to

271
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,320
seven million gallons of grey water that

272
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
runs adjacent to our campus on a daily

273
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,200
basis

274
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,040
this is treated sewage water that dumps

275
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
into the potomac river every day

276
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
as population growth will continue in

277
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,360
the area that will grow to over 11

278
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,600
million gallons a day that means we have

279
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
access to cooling water that is recycled

280
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,279
instead of using traditional drinking

281
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,519
water from a farm or irrigation water we

282
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,200
can actually use treated gray water that

283
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,279
would simply go out to the river and use

284
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,360
that to cool the data centers and also

285
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,480
in dealing with future liquid

286
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,959
technologies and other things like that

287
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,720
it is a huge advantage and a benefit for

288
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
sustainability goals that the industry

289
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,000
has

290
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,360
when the largest thing we're doing and

291
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,279
something that is completely different

292
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,959
industry is building the largest fiber

293
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,120
backbone that has ever been created

294
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,959
our q loop platform has the capacity of

295
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,680
over 200 000 strands of fiber it's a 43

296
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,279
mile ring linking our campus to the

297
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,160
ashburn ecosystem to the south

298
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
we cross the potomac river twice those

299
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,839
river crossings are getting underway and

300
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,240
construction will start around the april

301
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
2022 time frame very large very deep

302
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,160
borings

303
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,600
across the river

304
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
our entire ring is built to millcom

305
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
standards with a depth of at least 56

306
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,000
inches we have 33 2 inch conduits going

307
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,519
in place

308
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,279
on campus for interconnection we have

309
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,360
two network centers we'll be doing

310
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,040
telecent automated robotic cross

311
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,000
connects

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
those cross connects will be able to be

313
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,440
delivered in two minutes without a human

314
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
being touching it

315
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,600
even more exciting is that those teleset

316
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,120
machines can be located in various

317
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
buildings throughout the ashburn or data

318
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
center alley area and linked into our

319
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,320
campus

320
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,079
we could simultaneously do a cross

321
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,079
connect let's say across 20 different

322
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,079
interconnected buildings using these

323
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,880
machines it would only take two minutes

324
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,399
you have a thousand cross connects with

325
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,079
some variability on batching and you're

326
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,240
talking about 2 000 minutes to deliver

327
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
those without a human being ever

328
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,920
touching them all done simultaneously

329
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
without truck rolls very exciting and a

330
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
big change for our industry

331
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,279
on our campus we have multiple

332
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,640
distribution rings going back to the

333
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
network centers to the point where 120

334
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
conduits

335
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
are coming up in a single point into the

336
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,800
network centers

337
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,399
each of these network center campuses

338
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,320
are over five acres and will facilitate

a tab especially if you're nervous about

414

staying in front of the microphone this

415
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,480
is a great way to still ask your

416
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
question whether you're remote or in

417
