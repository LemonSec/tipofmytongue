1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
[Music]

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,640
so today we have one lightning talk for

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,280
you guys here at nanaki84 so please

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,240
welcome

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,320
michael deboer to the stage and he'll be

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,679
presenting

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,920
nocus nakis

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,840
knock us 7330 incoming storm uh michael

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,680
is from tamp net and he's actually based

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,279
in amsterdam so he traveled a bit of a

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,000
way to get here uh this yeah

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,920
this is his second time presenting uh

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
his first time was at dallas um at nanox

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
68 for a lightning talk called peering

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,480
management system about a service called

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,000
hibernia

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,040
welcome back michael thank you very much

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,200
all right i think that i'm actually

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
the last speaker on stage then

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
so my name is michael debour and

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
i work for tom net

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
and i want to tell you a little story

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,399
dominant is specializing in offshore

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,399
telecommunication

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,879
telecom offshore telecommunication poses

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,000
his own set of extra difficulties

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,440
opposed to the regular networking that

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,879
we already know and

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,479
were explained

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,119
uh one of the problems that we have in

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,600
the in our gulf of mexico network is

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,159
incoming storms internally it's known as

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,600
knock us 7330 incoming storm

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,439
so i'm going to talk to you a bit about

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,960
it and hopefully you'll find that

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,439
interesting

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,000
first a little bit what tom net is doing

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
in our business areas i promise you this

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,759
is not a commercial talk but we need to

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,040
set the stage a bit we specialize in

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
providing connectivity in oil and gas

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,079
industry offshore wind farms

43
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,880
maritime and since we are running fiber

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,280
from offshore asset to offshore asset we

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,840
also have a very unique fiber outs

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
through the north sea in the gulf of

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,119
mexico so with that we can also

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,720
supply the international carrier market

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,360
um yeah i said again i am

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,079
this is our this is our gulf of mexico

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,679
network which you can see over here

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,399
it's a coverage area we are building a

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,639
lte 4g network

54
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,360
to supply maritime industry

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,200
rov vessels

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,800
exploration oil and gas industry

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,239
we also have a fiber running

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,319
from

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,840
which you can see the landing stations

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
on the top left

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,560
to

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,519
pascal on the right side

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,080
our network consists of microwaves

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,519
from platform to platform to platform um

65
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,680
so they're all very intertwined and we

66
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
also try to connect platforms into uh

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,080
into the fiber which you can see is the

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,120
green line

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
on the bottom

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,560
so uh

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,599
in august 2021 hurricane ida was the

72
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,280
deadly it was a deadly and destructive

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,120
category four hurricane

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,800
that become the second most damaging and

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
intense hurricane to make landfall in

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
the us state of louisiana on the record

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,920
behind hurricane katrina in 2005.

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
so

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,040
that actually hit our network pretty

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
pretty hard

81
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
and i am sitting in europe

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
at my desk and i receive an email from

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
my boss sitting here in the room as well

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,480
uh that the storm now has changed to a

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,959
tropical storm and it is named ida

86
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,239
and then back then we were still

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,159
expecting it to be a category two or a

88
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
category three

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,280
and

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,200
yeah for me working in the north sea

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,080
area not from the us is very remarkable

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
to see such emails land to your inbox

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,120
who is expecting hurricanes

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,480
over your network or through your

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,480
network

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,319
so what we see here is the estimated

97
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,159
trajectory of hurricane ida over our

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,040
network

99
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,760
uh

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,000
again you can see the platforms that we

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,959
are

102
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,360
building with the micro microwave hops

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,480
in between

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,040
you can also see the fiber so all the

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,480
operators in the gulf they were

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
evacuating their platforms

107
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,920
um

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,720
everybody left their assets as is

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,360
put everything nice and tidy and went

110
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,400
off their

111
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,680
platforms

112
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,040
category 4

113
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,519
hurricanes mean wind speeds up to 140

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,959
miles an hour with gusts up to 165

115
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
and it was expected to hit on sunday the

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,240
29th of august

117
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
yeah obviously we were expecting uh

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
outfall on our microwave systems

119
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,400
we uh we accounted for all our personnel

120
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,240
a lot of that a lot of our personnel

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,400
lives in louisiana so we account for

122
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,479
their safety as well

123
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,960
we rent it rented backup generators and

124
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
we checked our spare supplies

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
so hopefully we can recover as quickly

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,440
as possible

127
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,479
so this is what it looks like if a

128
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,960
category 4 hurricane travels over your

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
network you

130
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
can see the eye of the hurricane winking

131
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,639
at you

132
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,120
yeah this is frightening

133
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
for us as a network operator but it's

134
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,600
not even it's it's our network but it's

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,440
the entire state of louisiana who has a

136
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,840
big problem at this point in time

137
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,160
so yeah it's very

138
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
unfortunate

139
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,039
so the problems that occur obviously

140
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,880
power issues

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,360
we power our equipment based on

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
generators which are supplied from the

143
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
operators of the platforms

144
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,600
they shut down their generators

145
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,280
batteries drained our equipment got

146
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,759
offline

147
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,360
we had dishes

148
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
microwave dishes which were out of whack

149
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,560
so that needed to be realigned

150
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
we had a lot of damaged equipment we had

151
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,080
microwaves

152
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,120
dented

153
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,520
we actually had dishes missing

154
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,520
yep sorry it's gone um yeah

155
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,880
all the platforms were unmanned and um

156
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,039
and there was no way of telling

157
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
what uh what

158
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
the damages is

159
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
or what the damage was

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,560
uh

161
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,160
we

162
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
the recovery challenges was obviously

163
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,400
damages to the platforms as well uh

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
flares broke off

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,199
railings of the platforms were unusable

166
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,759
uh all the helicopters which we used to

167
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,840
fly off to the assets were relocated out

168
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,240
of state so we could actually not head

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
out to the platforms

170
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,000
joe biden was just was nice to visit the

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,479
state of louisiana closing off the

172
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,880
airspace so we could not fly again

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,319
yeah very unfortunate but

174
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,680
and then port fushon which is a very big

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,199
or the most important um

176
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,639
base

177
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,479
for the oil and gas industry in the gulf

178
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,440
of mexico was damaged the roads to the

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,720
base were covered with debris

180
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,360
the power lines at the base were all

181
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,479
destroyed

182
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,280
and

183
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,759
the water was rising so that was very

184
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,000
unfortunate as well so all the operators

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
who were actually supplying their

186
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,479
offshore assets from port fujon needed

187
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,680
to set up new supply bases

188
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,919
which just delays

189
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,080
our repairs as well you can't fit a

190
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,120
microwave dish in a helicopter

191
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,199
we had weather challenges uh in the week

192
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
after obviously we had the good co-fed

193
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,960
co-fit situation still going on

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,840
and

195
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,479
yeah since everybody has problems it's

196
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,039
not only us so there was a very limited

197
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,639
amount of technical resources in the

198
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,039
industry

199
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,319
so to summarize at worst point in time

200
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,360
we had 112 sides down

201
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,039
10 people worked around the clock to

202
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,199
bring the assets back online and again i

203
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,720
find it's very remarkable that the

204
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,800
people who work for us

205
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
they also they live in louisiana they

206
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,879
also have problems at home and still

207
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,560
come out

208
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,199
to get the network reports repaired as

209
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,120
quickly as possible so i have a lot of

210
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,759
respect for that

211
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,560
after six days we had 45 of the network

212
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,680
recovered there were 110 tickets created

213
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,440
for our operations team in the u.s and

214
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
we had around 50 dispatches

215
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,039
offshore to get it all fixed

216
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,440
the the ticket that we had opened the

217
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,560
big ticket

218
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,840
dragged out for a long time uh

219
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,160
some platforms actually never got fixed

220
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,399
because the damage was so big

221
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,839
um

222
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,839
yeah so let's have a quick look

223
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,839
on the left side you see a microwave

224
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,039
dish

225
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,760
with a dent in it rendering it useless

226
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
on the right side you see them just

227
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,160
blown out of whack

228
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,240
and unfortunately if you have a

229
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
microwave system and you want to realign

230
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,920
the antennas you need to do that on both

231
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,959
sides

232
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,399
so you need an engineer on one side

233
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,080
engineer on the other side you need to

234
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,040
fly to both assets

235
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
to get that link back online

236
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,839
we also have the intermediate hops

237
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,600
which are offline and then stuff on the

238
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
on a stick

239
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,360
it's also offline because of some of the

240
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,680
links

241
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,720
on the left side you see a port fusion

242
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,399
you can see the power lines being

243
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,839
destroyed you see the water rising

244
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,000
and on the right side you see one of our

245
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,839
beach crossings you see

246
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,399
our own antennas on the bottom just

247
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,080
misaligned but also all the other

248
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,240
operators who have equipment in that

249
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,600
same tower

250
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
having

251
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
so everybody wants to get into those

252
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,640
towers to realign their antennas at the

253
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
same time

254
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,599
which also gives problems

255
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,560
sorry

256
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,959
now we see

257
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,600
we see more uh

258
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,920
dishes being dent by the mere force of

259
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,839
the wind pushing from the front to the

260
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
back of the uh

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,120
of the dish

262
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,959
you also see the the cover or the

263
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,360
protective parts of the dishes blown off

264
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,480
on the on the right picture

265
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,760
so yeah obviously we learned lessons uh

266
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
as an offshore or as a company

267
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,839
specializing in offshore communication

268
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,800
we are

269
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
used to rough

270
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,519
rough terrains uh yeah but we learned as

271
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,640
well

272
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,959
renewable power solutions uh could help

273
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,600
us like wind or uh or solar to keep

274
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
stuff online or at least at a low power

275
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,519
situation

276
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,240
uh even if

277
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,560
installing solar panels is also

278
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,480
difficult you don't want them to blow

279
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,040
away in the next hurricane

280
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,720
we are re

281
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
evaluating our antenna structures and we

282
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
are improving in that we are adding

283
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,959
redundancy more microwave links we are

284
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,200
tying more assets into the deep water

285
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
fiber

286
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
we train for hurricane readiness so

287
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,240
we are prepared for uh for more

288
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,079
hurricanes to come

289
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,480
we are strategically relocating spare

290
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,560
parts so we're not depending on one

291
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,320
stock of spare parts in our network but

292
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,760
we could actually

293
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,920
have it geographically

294
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,880
separated over several locations and we

295
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,200
reserve more helicopter and technicians

296
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,279
prior to incoming storms as much as

297
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,680
possible

298
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,240
so yeah i hope you find this

299
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
interesting

300
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
if you have any questions

301
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,360
please

302
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680
we didn't

303
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,200
we do not currently have any questions

304
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,760
in the chat

305
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,200
okay we've got one

306
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,240
hi i'm lee martes with aws

307
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,720
i guess i was wondering um i think in

308
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,839
the tech field it's very difficult to

309
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,959
think about

310
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,760
um environmental ramifications to

311
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,279
technology

312
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,880
um

313
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,959
and with your company what were the

314
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,839
financial distresses that were related

315
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,800
to

316
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
an unforeseen

317
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,560
natural disaster like this

318
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,399
and it's an actual a very good question

319
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,880
which i am uh i can't give you the

320
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
answer to

321
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,760
um

322
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,839
but yeah it's difficult to account for

323
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,160
national disasters in our network

324
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,040
um we're also expanding to canada and

325
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,160
we're exporting to uh maybe to africa or

326
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,360
brazil

327
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,399
and well we are already thinking maybe

328
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,360
of uh problems with icebergs or pirates

329
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
posing threats to our networks as well

330
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,240
so

331
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
offshore is interesting uh next to the

332
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,200
network so a good warning for other

333
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,399
people just

334
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
think about it maybe exactly yes of

335
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,600
course

336
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
we did get one question i'll jump that

337
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
one in here and then go to you next um

338
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,959
george emojio asked what is the ballpark

339
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,120
cost per year to operate the network

340
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
uh again yeah these are great questions

341
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,760
well uh i don't know the exact details

342
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,639
uh

343
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,399
we are operating a network in the north

344
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,720
sea we're operating in in norway we're

345
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
operating in the netherlands we're

346
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,320
operating it in the uk and all the

347
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,519
networks are built uh different uh the

348
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,440
norwegian network has a lot of fiber in

349
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,320
it

350
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
uh and you and a lot of times the

351
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
companies build the fiber from platform

352
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
to platform um

353
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,800
they just have them the the

354
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,320
platforms are staying there for so long

355
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,200
that it's

356
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,440
uh it makes sense

357
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,000
uh but in the netherlands the

358
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
infrastructure is older and it doesn't

359
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,160
make sense to invest in fiber so we

360
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,240
build microwave to microwave which adds

361
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,760
a lot of cost as well

362
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,560
so yeah these companies they pay a lot

363
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
of money for uh

364
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,120
well relatively low bandwidth uh links

365
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,199
as you can imagine but i can't give the

366
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,560
exact numbers i don't even know him

367
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,600
good so warren kumari google

368
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,079
so on one of your last slides wow this

369
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,320
mic's overdriven you spoke about

370
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,560
improving the antennas to survive better

371
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,959
wind loading how do you sort of do that

372
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,920
so it survives hurricane weather

373
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,440
yeah good question

374
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,519
so the microwave fontanas they are

375
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,920
mounted with side struts

376
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,720
and it's just reevaluating the way the

377
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,399
side struts are connected to the

378
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,480
structure of the platform where they are

379
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
connected to the platform uh the

380
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,959
thickness etc

381
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,639
i mean it sort of seems like if you had

382
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,560
a shroud over the front of it that made

383
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,639
it more aerodynamic it wouldn't catch as

384
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,560
much wind and

385
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,839
get a hold of it but i'm guessing

386
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,279
somebody's already thought about this

387
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,760
thank you

388
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
we do have a few more questions here uh

389
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
jeff bartok asks did your network map

390
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,800
show that you have underwater fiber

391
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,880
paths to some of your offshore nodes and

392
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,639
was there any damage to this fiber and

393
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,800
if so how do you handle the repair

394
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,199
uh luckily uh yeah to answer the

395
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,000
question yes we do have uh uh

396
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,160
shopsy fiber traveling to uh to the

397
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,399
platforms unfortunately the fiber was

398
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,480
not damaged during this specific

399
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,519
incident

400
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,240
but yeah obviously these fibers

401
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,360
get

402
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,079
damaged as normal subsidy fibers are get

403
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,079
damaged as well so we have companies on

404
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,079
standby

405
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,279
if they get damaged by shunt fault or uh

406
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,639
they reel them up

407
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,800
splice them back together and and repair

408
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,639
them and let them sink down again yeah

409
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
we have another question on the virtual

410
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,120
since i don't see anyone standing up

411
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
blake willis um i'll probably butcher

412
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,639
the pronunciation but i think he's

413
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,519
saying thank you in dutch

414
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
how about a hurricane do you think you

415
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,920
can withstand and still recover like

416
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
this without a complete rebuild

417
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,279
is there gear that can stand up to a

418
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,199
category five

419
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,880
who yeah

420
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,480
uh

421
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,440
i

422
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
i don't even want to think about it to

423
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,480
be very honest

424
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
um

425
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,079
the the idea of a category four

426
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,639
hurricane and what dad did on land and

427
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,639
to the people

428
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,440
it's

429
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
crazy so i don't want to think about it

430
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,519
but eventually

431
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,680
our company can overcome obviously

432
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,639
well that's all i have in the chat here

433
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,079
and looks like we're out of questions

434
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,759
here as well all right thank you so much

435
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,230
for your time

436
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,120
[Applause]

437
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,720
[Music]

438
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
you
