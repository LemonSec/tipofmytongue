00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
[Music]

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,440
i'd like to introduce kyle like

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,760
presenting effects of electromagnetic

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,320
energy on electronics uh kyle works in

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,559
the high power electromagnetic group of

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,039
applied research associates he runs the

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,119
electromagnetic testing and technology

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,840
development center in san antonio texas

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,840
this is kyle's first time presenting at

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,439
nanog and we're certainly happy to have

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,359
him speaking with us today welcome kyle

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,200
good morning yeah this is certainly my

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,040
first uh nano because i've been calling

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
it nano g this whole time just learning

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,160
the rest not how you say that

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,719
so um

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,239
i realize that this talk seems a little

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,760
bit out of scope from a lot of the other

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,760
talks they're typically given here but

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,719
uh the motivation really is to talk

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,480
about a threat to data centers and

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,399
network infrastructure in general it's

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,960
often overlooked i know that there's a

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,640
lot of time and effort spent into

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,760
ensuring

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
the reliability of data centers and the

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,439
infrastructure around them

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,640
accounting for

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
physical security and redundant power

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,119
source and backup data storage but

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,960
what's often not considered is

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,880
electromagnetic threats

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,799
so during this presentation i'm going to

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,159
give a

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,080
variety of sources of electromagnetic

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,840
threats and how you can mitigate them

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,040
so uh the outline of this talk there are

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,640
three em threats i'm gonna talk about

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
the first being geomagnetic disturbances

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,840
we're gonna move on to the high altitude

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
um nuclear

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,960
detonations that give rise to

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,360
electromagnetic pulses last one's going

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,200
to be intentional electromagnetic

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,280
interference or just emi some people

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,240
call it

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,320
and then finally talk about how you can

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,240
protect yourselves and then mitigate

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,439
these

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,839
effects

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,320
so

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
before i actually jump into this i want

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,920
to talk about the the mechanism by which

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,680
electromagnetic energy

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,000
is actually going to damage electronics

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,960
so

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
much like an antenna works it's it's a

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,120
conductor that's meant to pick up

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,480
electronic energy right but when

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,560
electric fields are are so large they

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,160
can actually drive currents on places

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
that currents are not supposed to be

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
going and if you get a large enough

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,200
current in a in a small enough area you

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,440
can get heat in you can burn out devices

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280
sometimes just driving current where

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
it's not supposed to go can flip

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,239
transistors and turn parts of your

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,680
circuitry out that should not be on

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,519
anymore and it's these kind of uh

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,200
variations that lead to damage in their

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,839
equipment

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,560
so

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,599
a lot c shouldn't be there

75
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,840
first talk or the first subject is about

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,800
geomagnetic disturbances and generally

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
what happens in these types of events

78
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,720
you have high energy particles from the

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,519
sun typically protons electrons alpha

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,519
particles that interact with air of the

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,920
atmosphere and it creates this hot

82
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,640
ionized pocket of air really and this

83
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
pocket interacts with our geomagnetic

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
field to create electromagnetic

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
radiation

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,080
and now typically this happens in um you

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,760
know concentrations that are so small

88
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,599
that the effects are typically benign

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,120
and you only see effects if you're doing

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,440
something like uh launching 49

91
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,920
satellites into orbit and you

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,560
suddenly lose 40 of them and in that

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,319
case it wasn't really an electromagnetic

94
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,879
effect it had to do with uh a denser

95
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,280
pocket of air intercepting the path of

96
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,799
these satellites and just the increased

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,640
drag on them slowed them down to cause

98
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,560
them to fall into orbit or fall out of

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,879
orbit

100
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
so

101
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,360
this steady stream of particles from the

102
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
sun typically called solar wind

103
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,840
is uh you know it's always hitting the

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,519
earth and typically our geomagnetic

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,319
field

106
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,000
protects us from it it concentrates its

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,480
particles toward the pole but if you get

108
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,040
enough of them such as in a coronal mass

109
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,080
section it can become a large issue the

110
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
the interactions between the ions and

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,519
the atmosphere and the geomagnetic field

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
produce strong vm radiation and these

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,239
are typically low frequency signals and

114
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
low frequencies like to couple to long

115
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,280
conductors such as transmission lines

116
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,160
and uh communication lines maybe long

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,959
ethernet cords that kind of thing

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,918
and so

119
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
because the power grid of course is made

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
up of a lot of very long conductors it's

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,440
particularly vulnerable to a geomagnetic

122
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,680
storm and things like this have happened

123
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,639
before

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,680
so back in 1989 we have what's called

125
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
the hydroquebec event or sometimes

126
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,720
called the great geomagnetic storm

127
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
but for about two to three days there

128
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,400
was a

129
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
burst of impulses from the sun that were

130
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,719
focused along the us canada border

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,479
and so

132
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,560
this resulted in large currents being

133
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
driven on these transmission lines and

134
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,160
actually tripped a lot of circuit

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
breakers that were handled in the grid

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
in the quebec area and the entire city

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,800
was without power for hours that day

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,039
and then you know down uh in the states

139
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,039
here there's a nuclear plant in salem

140
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,720
new jersey and that experienced a

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,280
particularly devastating effect one of

142
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
the transformers which is actually shown

143
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
over here uh so much current was driven

144
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,759
into it that the installation of wires

145
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,240
evaporated wires melted together and

146
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,919
these these large transformers are not

147
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,759
something that you can just buy a new

148
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,600
one and replace you know it can take

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,919
months to get one so in this case only

150
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,080
one transformer went out but if you have

151
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,600
many of these things going out you could

152
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
have portions of your grid down for

153
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,400
months to over a year

154
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,039
now even

155
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,440
before that event

156
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,120
before we actually had power lines

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,639
crisscrossing the nation we still had

158
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,320
telegraph lines

159
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,600
all around um the carrington event

160
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,080
1859 about a little more than 100 years

161
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
before the quebec event

162
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,880
it's typically regarded as the largest

163
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
recorded geomagnetic disturbance

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,600
and so at that time telegraph operators

165
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
were reporting that they were being

166
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,560
shocked by their equipment some said

167
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,319
that they could send signals down their

168
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,319
line without even having to supply power

169
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,360
to them

170
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,160
um

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,759
general corruption in the signals that

172
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,440
were being sent and the same thing could

173
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,199
happen today at communication lines

174
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,639
whenever you're putting power on these

175
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,400
lines it's not supposed to be there it

176
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
can interact with your intended signal

177
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
if a similar event

178
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,560
in in magnitude to the character event

179
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
would happen today a lloyds of london

180
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
report uh estimated between 600 billion

181
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
to 2.6 trillion dollars in damage you

182
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,479
know and and you get that kind of damage

183
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,720
from these large transformers going out

184
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,960
in data centers or sorry in uh

185
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,639
substations and then taking out

186
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,319
equipment and data centers taking things

187
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,639
offline for large periods of time

188
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,600
um even if you do have backup generators

189
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
how long can they run for if the grid is

190
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,599
down for pushing a year you're not going

191
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,039
to have enough fuel to keep it going all

192
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,440
the time

193
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,039
and this is um it's a serious a serious

194
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,720
enough threat that there have been

195
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
multiple documents issued by the doug by

196
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,240
the government directing for the

197
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,960
protection of critical infrastructure so

198
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,120
power grid uh financial systems and

199
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,560
banking systems communication networks

200
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,479
so the next source of electromagnetic

201
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,919
energy i'm going to talk about is the

202
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,400
emp an electromagnetic pulse from a high

203
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,360
altitude nuclear detonation

204
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
so what's shown in this uh contour plot

205
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,759
here is peak electric field in the

206
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,880
background you can make out the

207
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,960
continental united states and so you can

208
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,120
see the rains of impact an event like

209
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,520
this could happen

210
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,240
when a nuclear weapon is detonated among

211
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,560
other things that releases gamma rays in

212
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
the atmosphere and these gamma rays

213
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,360
serve to strip electrons away

214
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,160
from air molecules and you end up with

215
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,000
this high energy current in the

216
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
atmosphere that again is turned by the

217
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
geomagnetic field and this creates a

218
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,120
propagating electromagnetic pulse

219
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,199
now this is something that on the ground

220
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,479
can lead to

221
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,240
tens of thousands of volts per meter

222
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,720
huge electric fields and it gets up to

223
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,280
those levels in billionths of a second

224
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
it's very fast

225
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,919
now like uh geomagnetic disturbances

226
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,440
there are some very low frequency

227
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,360
signals in emp that will couple to your

228
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,440
power grid and your transmission lines

229
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
in general there are also a lot of very

230
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
high frequencies and it's a high

231
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,039
frequency signals that can be damaged

232
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,760
into smaller electronics your computers

233
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,399
your routers your switches

234
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,159
and that's not just theoretical you know

235
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,880
we uh we do testing to show that kind of

236
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,599
thing does happen

237
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,480
one of the first times that people

238
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
started to actually piece together that

239
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
emp was a thing resulted from nuclear

240
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,800
weapons at the time they called it emp

241
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
they called it radio flash

242
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
but while we were doing above ground

243
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,040
testing this one took place in 1962

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,480
people were noticing effects on their

245
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,800
electronic equipment resulted from them

246
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,040
starfish prime was a 1.4 megaton

247
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,800
nuclear weapon

248
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,640
if you're not familiar with megaton it's

249
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,000
equivalent of 1.4 million tons of tnt

250
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
equivalent

251
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
and about a thousand miles away in

252
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
hawaii people were noticing effects um

253
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
in addition to satellites in orbit that

254
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,279
were taken out

255
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,519
uh folks noticing that burglar burglar

256
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,760
alarms are being set off for its parts

257
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
of their power grid were being disabled

258
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
telephone and radio services were going

259
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,320
down

260
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,240
and

261
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,600
you know while america was doing this

262
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,959
kind of testing other countries were

263
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,839
doing similar testing as well the k3 184

264
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,800
nuclear test was done by russians

265
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,040
same year as a starfish prime test and

266
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,279
similar effects were seen

267
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,120
there were reports of

268
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
power supplies for radio equipment

269
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,399
burning up so the radio equipment became

270
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,720
useless and just uh

271
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,560
anything in the area connected to a long

272
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,119
conductor is pretty much blown out

273
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,360
in march of 2019 an executive order was

274
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,959
issued that directs the strengthening of

275
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,040
our critical infrastructure to emp

276
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,120
specifically like the one issued for

277
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
geomagnetic storms it calls for the

278
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
protection of our power grid and banking

279
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
and financial systems and federal

280
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,399
networks in general

281
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,240
there are already power utilities and

282
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
financial institutes that are investing

283
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,560
in protecting their infrastructure from

284
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
general electromagnetic threats in

285
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
general joint base san antonio down the

286
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,160
road has organized an electromagnetic

287
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,079
defense initiative

288
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,000
and the goal of this is to ensure the

289
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,240
resiliency of not only their power grid

290
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,480
but also a lot of the new 5g equipment

291
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,360
that's being installed around the city

292
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,720
and it's very important that this kind

293
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,560
of equipment is protected because we

294
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,399
know it is vulnerable

295
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,120
we do emp testing

296
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
now of course we're not actually

297
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,040
setting off a nuclear weapon and seeing

298
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,519
what happens to it the dod maintains

299
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,680
these large-scale emp simulators where

300
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
testing can occur

301
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,000
and in these situations

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,640
the pictures here shown to test of a lot

303
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,600
of i.t equipment we set this all up in a

304
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
functional way

305
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
it's a work in before we test it and

306
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,959
it's important that happen one because

307
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,640
it's important that all of the

308
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,240
conductive connections that are made to

309
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,320
these devices are actually there because

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
they all serve as antennas to drive

311
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,079
energy into the device

312
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,279
and also we want to make sure it's

313
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,519
working because then when you zap it you

314
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,959
know something goes wrong you could say

315
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,240
that you actually broke it because it

316
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,800
used to be working

317
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,160
so

318
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
hollywood gives people this idea that if

319
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,639
an efp event were to happen that planes

320
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,399
would fall from the sky and your phones

321
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,839
would explode that kind of thing and

322
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,440
it's just simply not true there are a

323
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,279
lot of things that would generally be

324
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,160
okay

325
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
small devices like your cell phone would

326
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,959
generally be fine um who knows if

327
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,800
there'd be an actual cell network to

328
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,079
make them useful that's a different

329
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,000
story but

330
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,360
as long as your phone doesn't say

331
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,000
connected to a power cord that can drive

332
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,639
energy into it it'd probably be fine

333
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,079
there are instances where things are

334
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,480
just temporarily upset we've seen

335
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
computers that will just freeze

336
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,480
and your it department will be happy to

337
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,760
know that you can just turn it off and

338
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,000
on again and it'll be fine

339
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
and then sometimes things are actually

340
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,800
damaged so things connected to ethernet

341
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,639
cords are particularly vulnerable just

342
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,240
because these long ethernet cords

343
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,320
channel a lot of energy into these ports

344
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,519
sometimes you can load the port

345
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,040
permanently sometimes they'll come back

346
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
online

347
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,240
sometimes the switch of the router is

348
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
okay and you can just move your cord to

349
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,680
another port but at all it all depends

350
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,120
okay the final source of electromagnetic

351
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,560
energy i'm going to talk about is

352
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,279
intentional electromagnetic interference

353
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,360
and some people consider this

354
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
the the most worrisome in terms of

355
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,639
likelihood and severity of effect you

356
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,240
know geomagnetic storms are something

357
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
that are certainly going to happen one

358
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,200
day but the um actual effect of them is

359
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
going to be unknown it's going to be

360
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,480
related to how strong the storm is a

361
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,079
nuclear emp is something that we hope

362
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,800
never happens um iemi is something that

363
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
very realistically

364
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,000
could be done

365
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,880
and

366
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,360
unlike the last two sources of vm i

367
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,720
talked about this is something that's a

368
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
more localized attack and it's something

369
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
that can be carried out by individuals

370
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
rather than mother nature or

371
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,160
state-sponsored activities

372
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,800
iemi comes in a variety of forms and

373
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,639
really any type of electromagnetic

374
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,880
radiation that is intended to interfere

375
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,279
with or damage electronic equipment can

376
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,519
be considered iemi

377
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,440
some of the devices are built to target

378
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,839
specific equipment say somebody knows

379
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,959
about a particular make and model of a

380
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,560
piece of vital equipment you use they

381
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,880
can make an ie device to target that

382
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,760
particular piece of equipment

383
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,279
but a lot of times people build these

384
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,920
devices just to jam the airwaves and

385
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
kind of

386
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,120
take out anything that is trying to

387
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,760
receive a signal

388
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,480
shown in this photo this is a a

389
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,040
suitcase-sized high-powered microwave

390
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
source and this is something an

391
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,199
individual could say try to sneak into a

392
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,920
facility say they know that the bathroom

393
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,240
shares a wall with a server room you

394
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
know maybe they're they're able to get

395
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,959
to the bathroom and they plant the

396
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,639
suitcase device in there pointed out

397
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,199
your equipment

398
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,399
and things like this do happen

399
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,639
um what i have here is a list of some

400
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,680
cases i was able to dig up about iemi

401
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,240
instances over the world um

402
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,040
three of them are pretty much

403
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
the intention is criminal activity

404
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,680
robbery in general the first item here

405
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,720
is a man using an em disruptor to

406
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,880
trigger a win in a gaming machine just

407
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,639
consider thievery

408
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,000
but then there are also folks that are

409
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,959
able to disarm security systems so there

410
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,720
is a case of a man in i think it was

411
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,480
russia who is able to build around these

412
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,560
devices disarm material restore a

413
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
security system and just get in and get

414
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,440
out

415
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,959
and folks have also done this with

416
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,279
security systems on on limousines that

417
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,440
were meant to use a cellular network to

418
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
call out to get help disabled they

419
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,240
couldn't call out

420
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
there are also cases of uh

421
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
chestnut rebels used in similar devices

422
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,360
to take out police police radio systems

423
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,920
and then gain access to controlled areas

424
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,560
the last one here is a an instance of

425
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,240
revenge a man of the netherlands was

426
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,079
denied a bank loan and he wasn't too

427
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,160
happy about that he went online learned

428
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,839
how to make an em disrupter and was able

429
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,000
to take out their iq system for a few

430
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,839
hours before they tracked him down

431
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,839
and you know what's scary is that all

432
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,279
the things i just talked about they're

433
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,199
not things you have to be particularly

434
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,440
tech savvy to do you know you can look

435
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,959
online at how to build these things you

436
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,720
don't have to be very knowledgeable and

437
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,160
if you don't even want to do that you

438
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,600
can just buy them

439
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,320
this suitcase hpm source right here a

440
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
company in austin makes it you can buy

441
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
it from them this is designed for for

442
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,880
testing you know scientific purposes of

443
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,480
course i doubt they would sell it to you

444
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
if you adjust your average joe at least

445
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,519
i hope not um the other two devices here

446
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,519
i found on ebay you know not too

447
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,199
expensive either that meant to jam

448
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,120
cellular networks and and gps signals

449
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,000
probably on a list somewhere from

450
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,199
looking all this stuff up though

451
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,639
okay so you know it's not all doom and

452
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,399
gloom there are ways that you can

453
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,079
protect yourself from electromagnetic

454
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,399
threats and that's when we get into

455
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,680
shielding and hardening in

456
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,160
so in this little figure here the idea

457
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,600
that i'm trying to convey is that you

458
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,199
don't always have to block all of the

459
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,040
electromagnetic radiation you just have

460
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,359
to get it down to levels that are safe

461
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,760
you know it's not um

462
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,199
not enough power to actually damage

463
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,679
equipment

464
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,640
so i'm sure a lot of you are familiar

465
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
with the concept of a faraday cage it's

466
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,319
a conductive enclosure that

467
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,599
electromagnetic radiation cannot enter

468
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,480
an ideal shield would be say a

469
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,360
a hollow conductive sphere you know but

470
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,559
of course there are issues with the

471
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,400
sphere like you can't get anything in or

472
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,640
out of it you know you need a door and

473
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,799
for shielded enclosures like this there

474
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,400
are specially designed doors such that

475
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,000
when it's closed it forms a fully

476
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,960
conductive seam around the door usually

477
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,360
they're installed in pairs in a man-trap

478
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,600
configuration so only one can be opened

479
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,960
at a time

480
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,480
although that's not always foolproof

481
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,960
i've seen situations where people will

482
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,799
override the system and drop open both

483
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,080
doors because they're complaining they

484
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
couldn't get a cell signal inside it's

485
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
like that's the point

486
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,480
um what's um what's important to

487
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,160
consider with something like a faraday

488
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,520
cage and and shielding in general is

489
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,000
it's not a situation where every little

490
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
bit of shielding helps it's really an

491
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,919
all or nothing situation as soon as

492
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,160
there's a small crack in the shield it's

493
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,840
a place where electromagnetic energy can

494
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
get in and damage your equipment your

495
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,559
shield might as well not even be there

496
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,240
and now i realize that what i just said

497
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,600
might conflict with the photo i'm

498
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,919
showing here of this rf shielded rack

499
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,840
that has a whole array of holes in it

500
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
these are actually what's called wave

501
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,520
guides below cut off these are devices

502
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,320
that maintain a certain ratio of width

503
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,160
to distance such that em energy that

504
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,919
goes into them is exponentially

505
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,760
attenuated so by the time it gets in

506
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,440
it's so low level it's not going to harm

507
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
your equipment at all

508
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,080
and these uh wbcs they're good for

509
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,480
passing non-conductive

510
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,720
things into your shield so fiber optic

511
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,039
cables or in this case it's shown is for

512
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,600
ventilation so air moves in and out um

513
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
what they're not for is to pass your tv

514
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,840
antenna through so you can watch tv

515
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,080
because that's just a channel for em

516
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,679
energy to come in i've seen that happen

517
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,160
as well

518
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
i've also seen the case where somebody

519
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,880
tried to

520
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
there was a a bank putting together a

521
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
server room and they wanted to shield it

522
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
and they were talking to my team to see

523
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,559
if the shield was going to be effective

524
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,080
i asked what the materia what the

525
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
shielded material was made out of they

526
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,679
said they'd get back to me and the next

527
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,360
week they they sent me in the mail a

528
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,600
sample of the material that they had cut

529
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,440
right out of their shield

530
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,720
and so it doesn't matter what it's made

531
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,080
out of you know there's a huge hole in

532
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,679
your shield i can promise you it's not

533
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,000
working

534
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,600
um

535
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,760
but of course you can't uh or you don't

536
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,600
only need to bring non-conductive things

537
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
into a shielded enclosure you need to

538
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
bring things like power and maybe

539
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,400
signals and so to bring those kinds of

540
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,160
things into a shelter you can use

541
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,120
filters that are good for say directing

542
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
anything above the 60 hertz electric

543
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,559
signal you want to see

544
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,159
to ground and then

545
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,760
various forms of transient voltage

546
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,799
suppression um movs gtds and these

547
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,120
things will short over voltages to

548
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,039
ground and just bypass your shielding

549
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,600
enclosure

550
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,880
and then even if you don't want to

551
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,960
implement these kind of hardcore

552
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,480
shielding approaches there are ways that

553
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,960
you can mitigate what effect in the imp

554
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,080
that would actually have on your

555
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,400
facility

556
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,559
so i'm sure data centers you guys are

557
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,320
all familiar with having backup

558
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,760
generators

559
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,280
up systems automatic transfer switches

560
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,440
um how often are drills conducted you

561
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,280
know the people do you know first of all

562
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,840
this equipment is functional do people

563
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,000
know what's going to happen if say your

564
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,600
your automatic transfer switch doesn't

565
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
switch do they know what to do and who

566
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,080
to go to

567
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,760
and is that person contactable when this

568
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,640
kind of thing happens

569
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
it's also important to

570
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,720
keep distance just physical distance

571
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,960
between your important equipment and any

572
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,120
publicly accessible location that really

573
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,400
mitigates a lot of the iemi effects

574
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080
it's also very helpful to use

575
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
non-conductive material where possible

576
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
fiber optic cables are strongly

577
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,600
recommended or if you have to use

578
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,520
ethernet cords keep them as short as

579
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,840
possible

580
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,000
and and some things you can do right now

581
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
some um

582
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
you know simple ways to improve it again

583
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,000
shorten the ethernet cables they sell

584
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,159
these ferrites you may see them on the

585
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,919
end of power cables they're little beads

586
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,919
and what they do is they increase the

587
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,640
inductance of conductors and it prevents

588
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
high frequency signals from being driven

589
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,600
on them

590
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,120
that's what's shown in the uh the upper

591
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,400
right here

592
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,720
and then below that uh the point i just

593
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,159
want to make with that photo is one you

594
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,080
know keep everything organized so the

595
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,520
cables are no longer than they need to

596
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,080
be and then two if you find yourself in

597
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,880
a situation where you need to say

598
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,360
swap out an ethernet cable because the

599
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
port was blown you know it's going to be

600
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,480
very difficult to find where that cable

601
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,000
actually went if it's not organized

602
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,240
well went a little fast but that's it

603
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,880
for me are there any questions

604
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,000
um so do we have any do you have any

605
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,080
questions in the room

606
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,320
um

607
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,039
anybody

608
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,840
okay i do not see any questions in the q

609
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,440
a chat

610
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,360
if you were in the chat and you have

611
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,919
questions uh please post them

612
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,039
in the next minute or two

613
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,280
okay i don't think we have any questions

614
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
so thank you very much

615
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,840
thank you

616
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,160
[Applause]
