2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,480
at this time i'd like to introduce

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,440
richard

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,519
steenbergen who will be presenting

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,880
everything you always wanted to know

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,240
about optical

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,840
richard is the founder and ceo of

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,400
petabit scale and this is actually his

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,000
34th time presenting at nano

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,000
sorry richard's first time speaking in

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,320
anag was on a panel discussing xsb

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,720
security vulnerabilities at nanak 34 in

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
seattle 2005

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,640
welcome back to nano richard we are

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,079
certainly happy to have you back with us

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,320
today

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,399
thank you

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,360
all right so welcome to my tutorial

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,480
everything you always wanted to know

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,480
about optical otherwise otherwise known

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,239
as richard talks for two hours and

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,039
everyone tries not to fall asleep

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
so the purpose of this tutorial and this

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,199
is one that i've given many times and it

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,840
continues to be very popular because

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,680
it's really addressing something that is

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,480
not well understood in the internet

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,080
community

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,799
lots of us here run routers plug into

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,720
fiber we don't really understand the

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,479
details of what's happening why it's

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,920
happening what are the economics what

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,520
are the technology factors that are

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,880
driving that

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
and why we do what we do with it so the

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,080
purpose of this talk is really to kind

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,799
of introduce everyone to that space and

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,479
make sure that we walk through every

39
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,720
kind of major component that's involved

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,920
in in working with optical so it's not

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,079
going to make you a

42
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,079
optical expert there's a whole lot of

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,720
math in here that i'm leaving out but it

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,600
really

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
the point is to make everyone informed

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,560
about all of the major issues so you you

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,680
kind of understand what you're working

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
with when you're when you're doing it

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,079
so start with the very basics of fiber

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,920
optic transmission so

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,680
ultimately what is fiber why do we use

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,040
it what's what's the big deal well

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,600
really fiber is a waveguide for light so

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,200
you put light in one end and it comes

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,880
out the other end and it's usually made

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,119
of glass some silica of some form can

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,439
also be made of plastic but

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,759
big reasons to use fiber it's very low

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,079
cost you can you can make

60
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,199
very cheap very long uh very high count

61
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,878
thousands thousands and thousands of

62
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,000
strands of fiber in a very small cable

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
uh it's very light especially compared

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,480
to copper so that that matters shipping

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,200
logistics putting on a boat deploying it

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
in the field

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,879
it's very easy to work with

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,400
and you can carry a tremendous amount of

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
information and the weird thing about

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
fiber is it can either carry

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
as little information as you want if the

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
fiber itself is cheap you can light it

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,000
with very cheap optics and it really

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,280
doesn't need to carry a lot of

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,959
information or if the fiber is

76
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,640
constrained you put a little bit more

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
time and effort into the optical system

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
and you can light an enormous amount of

79
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,200
capacity more capacity than almost any

80
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,879
application needs

81
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,879
so it really the economics of it are

82
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,480
very interesting but it really fills

83
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,800
that role very well

84
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
and you can really carry a large number

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
of completely independent signals so

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
there's a mechanism called wdm wave

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,879
division multiplexing you take multiple

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,480
signals and stack them

89
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
and they in theory don't interfere with

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,440
each other

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,680
so it lets you grow a network it lets

92
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,800
you do

93
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
very long distances you can do thousands

94
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,560
tens of thousands of kilometers without

95
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,200
having to do a signal regeneration and

96
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,120
the technology continues to improve uh

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,920
you know we work with fiber that is 25

98
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,840
years old in the ground that is just as

99
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,640
capable today carrying 76 terabits as it

100
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,319
was when it was put in designed to carry

101
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,360
100 megabits and it will continue to do

102
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,599
so

103
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,280
so a little talk about the physics of

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
fiber so light propagating through

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,159
vacuum theoretically the fastest speed

106
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,000
that anything can travel in the universe

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,280
without getting into more complex

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
physics and it's necessary so the speed

109
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,239
of light is about

110
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,560
300 000 kilometers per second

111
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,920
which we call c

112
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,680
but when you propagate through a

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
material that is not a perfect vacuum

114
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
you propagate slower and so the the

115
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,360
ratio of that

116
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,280
is called the materials refractive index

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,439
so for example water has a refractive

118
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,439
index of 1.33 so it's 1.33 times slower

119
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,519
through water than it is through a

120
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,040
vacuum

121
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
and when light tries to pass from one

122
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
medium to another and there's a

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,639
different index of refraction then you

124
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,840
get a reflection and so that's

125
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,320
that's how fiber works so it's a

126
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,840
mechanism called total internal

127
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,919
reflection so as long as you have you

128
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,600
have two different kinds of glass you

129
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,360
have a core and a cladding if you didn't

130
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,199
have the cladding fiber wouldn't work

131
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,720
the cladding is what reflects it back

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,320
into the core

133
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,880
as long as the the light comes in at the

134
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
appropriate angle it will continue to be

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,160
reflected through the fiber

136
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,320
and it's very easy to manufacture that

137
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,080
that fiber cable

138
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
so here's kind of a demonstration of how

139
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,759
this works using a laser pointer and a

140
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
big piece of acrylic so it's the the

141
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
same kind of mechanism

142
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,280
that's that's just the big version of

143
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,039
how your your fiber optic signals work

144
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,240
so

145
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,639
remember that a lot of what we work with

146
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,280
we work with duplex fiber so it's

147
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,199
cheaper and easier for us to you have a

148
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,280
signal going one way you have a signal

149
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,880
coming the other way and it's cheaper

150
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
and easier for us to just throw two

151
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
strands of fiber at the problem but

152
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,880
that's not always the case right you can

153
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
you can use a point-to-point fiber in a

154
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
duplex link you can take one strand of

155
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,240
fiber and you can send

156
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,919
the signal over that one strand if you

157
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,560
really want to slightly more expensive

158
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
but but the fiber itself is perfectly

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,840
capable of carrying massive amounts of

160
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,039
information and really the economic

161
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,120
question is at what point do we

162
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
make the transition through the

163
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,280
different technologies

164
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,520
so the the most basic distinction when

165
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
you talk about fiber is multi-mode

166
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
versus single mode

167
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,800
so multi-mode is designed for really the

168
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
the point is to be used with cheaper

169
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,880
light sources so it's got an extremely

170
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,520
wide core you don't need as precise a

171
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,600
laser um

172
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,120
so the optics themselves end up being

173
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
much cheaper but it comes at the expense

174
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,280
of distance so what happens is because

175
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,360
the core is so wide the signal will

176
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,039
actually bounce around and you'll get

177
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,360
what's called modal dispersion uh modal

178
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,319
distortion so you you limit your

179
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,479
distance from thousands of kilometers

180
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,319
down to you know tens of meters

181
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,520
potentially

182
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,199
but it lets you use these very cheap

183
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,639
optics and interestingly the fiber

184
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,160
itself is actually more expensive so

185
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
multi-mode fiber is more expensive than

186
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
single mode but it's the optics that you

187
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,560
get to use are much cheaper

188
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,759
so there's a couple different kinds of

189
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,280
multi-mode out there

190
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
you've got om1 and om2 so these were the

191
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,919
original with called fitty grade

192
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,520
so this was the stuff that was designed

193
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
for 100 megabit fitting

194
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,160
so it's either got a 62.5 micron or a 50

195
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,199
micron core and that's the stuff that

196
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,199
really starts to break down at 10 gig

197
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,680
and beyond and then you move into the

198
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,199
the newer generation they laser

199
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,840
optimized so there's an aqua and a like

200
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,880
violet

201
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,280
colored jacket now for om4

202
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,360
and that's what you use for your 10 gig

203
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
and higher signals and it's specifically

204
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,039
designed for kind of what we're doing

205
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,680
with modern laser optimized stuff

206
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,400
so you know you can take a 10 gig signal

207
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,039
and take it from 26 meters and that's on

208
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,479
a good day to going 300 to 500 meters so

209
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,199
you really absolutely require it for

210
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,639
40 hundred

211
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,199
and beyond signals

212
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,440
single mode on the other hand is the the

213
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,199
fiber that you use and everything

214
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,479
interesting so if you're going to go any

215
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,240
kind of distance whatsoever if you're

216
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,720
going to to do anything real carry any

217
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,319
real capacity it's going to be single

218
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,960
mode and this fiber has a much smaller

219
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,479
core size so it's between 8 to 10

220
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,639
microns in size and so there's no

221
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
inherent distance limitations caused by

222
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,479
modal dispersion um so the the typical

223
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,840
figure that you look at when you talk

224
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,080
about a single mode fiber length without

225
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
any kind of amplification is 80

226
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,919
kilometers give or take

227
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,759
and you amplify new amplify and you

228
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,360
amplify but you don't have to regenerate

229
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,800
the signal i'll talk more about that in

230
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
a minute but

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
so smf has a million different

232
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
classifications it's it's even more

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,319
interesting so it also has a you know

234
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,879
just like multimod had om1om2 it has an

235
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,120
os1 and os2 but here we're talking about

236
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,680
the packaging of the fiber so os1 is

237
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,120
what's called tight buffered so that's

238
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,759
for your your patch cables uh an os2 is

239
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,759
the the kind of fiber that that's loose

240
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,400
and is blown into ducts

241
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,520
you'll hear smf referred to as smf 28 as

242
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,440
the standard fiber and so this is this

243
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,479
is a

244
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,240
product this is a corning product name

245
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,399
of one of the early original kind of

246
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,240
standard fiber designs

247
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
but there's lots of different variants

248
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,479
and each each even manufacturer and type

249
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,000
of fiber can have slightly different

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,720
properties uh so it comes in things like

251
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
low water peak dispersion shifted

252
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,399
non-zero dispersion shifted bend

253
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,880
insensitive uh and many many other

254
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,560
varieties

255
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,120
so here's a picture kind of showing the

256
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
the difference between the coarse eyes

257
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,320
just so you have an idea of what it

258
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
looks like in your in your mind and you

259
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,040
have this very very small fiber uh

260
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,920
inside the the core and interestingly i

261
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,600
wanted to add a slide about this but one

262
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
of the the new developments that people

263
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
are pushing towards for higher density

264
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,600
fiber is to put multiple fiber cores

265
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
inside of a single cladding

266
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,000
which is a little weird for splicing but

267
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,920
you can you can increase that density

268
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,000
kind of tremendously uh and people are

269
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,360
using that to do all their hero

270
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,839
experiments so we did 304 terabits per

271
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,600
blah blah blah yeah you just added more

272
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
cores inside of the the same cladding

273
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
but you have the room you you have the

274
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,760
room to add you know 8 16 even cores

275
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
inside of a single cladding and that is

276
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,440
you know technologically where things

277
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,360
are going

278
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
so there's a lot of different fiber

279
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
connector types that are out there you

280
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
could spend 30 minutes on this topic

281
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
alone but i threw in a slide with some

282
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,680
pictures

283
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,440
just to show the the weird things that

284
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
are out there

285
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
the the major things that we run across

286
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,920
in most data centers um older stuff sc

287
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,519
fiber

288
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,680
newer stuff lc and and then the higher

289
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,079
density more modern stuff the mtp mpo

290
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,839
kind of stuff but there's all these

291
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,920
other variants uh if you're in telco

292
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,079
land you might be dealing with fc uh you

293
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,760
might be dealing with the the uh you

294
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,839
know old stab and twist uh there's still

295
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,360
a lot of that stuff out there it really

296
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,720
depends on your environment and the

297
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,880
technology

298
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
all right so basic optical terms and

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
concepts so

300
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
uh we'll start by talking about optical

301
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,880
power so this is this is basically um

302
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
you know you put light into the fiber

303
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
and over time you're going to have loss

304
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,120
you're traveling through a non-vacuum

305
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,959
there's going to be some loss

306
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,160
there's going to be microscopic

307
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,680
imperfections in the fiber there's going

308
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,120
to be

309
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
you know things that are that are

310
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,440
absorbed and converted to heat

311
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
so over time you're going to have

312
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,200
attenuation so that's just the loss of

313
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,480
brightness

314
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,959
so we measure attenuation in decibels so

315
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,120
a decibel which is one tenth of a bell

316
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,160
is a logarithmic scale unit and the

317
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
interesting thing that most people don't

318
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,839
understand about a decibel is it doesn't

319
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,360
actually say anything itself a decibel

320
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
is simply expressing a ratio you have to

321
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,000
compare it against something else in

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
order for you to have an absolute value

323
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,079
so this is what's called a dimensionless

324
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
unit

325
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,040
so here i'll talk about that

326
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,000
so for example if you see someone say

327
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,640
minus 10 db what that means is one tenth

328
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,000
of the signal

329
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
and if they said minus 20 db that means

330
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
one 100th the signal so every 10 db is 1

331
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,040
10.

332
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
and then one that's not exactly precise

333
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,160
but is really close is plus 3 db is

334
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,800
double and minus 3 db is half but

335
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
remember this doesn't tell you double of

336
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,440
what so when you talk about an absolute

337
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
like how bright is this thing uh you

338
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,399
need a reference so in optical we use

339
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,560
what's called dbm so this is a decibel

340
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,200
relative to one milliwatt of power so if

341
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,760
someone says 0 dbm that means one

342
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,279
milliwatt if they say three dbm that

343
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,880
means two milliwatts if they say minus

344
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,639
three that means point five

345
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,040
um and sometimes i see people what's the

346
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,120
correct way to express zero and the

347
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,959
answer is negative infinity but no

348
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,200
router will actually show that correctly

349
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,519
but confusion between db and dbm is

350
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,959
probably one of the biggest mistakes

351
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,240
that you'll run into in the field

352
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,000
because the people don't they're not

353
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
precise about what what they're doing

354
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
so when you're out with test gear

355
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,959
you'll have a db in a dbm setting and

356
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,480
you'll be am i looking at this to

357
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
measure an absolute value or am i

358
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,839
looking at this to measure loss on a

359
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,040
cable and you'll get very different

360
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
results if you're in the wrong mode so

361
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,800
be be very careful of what you're

362
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,040
looking at and what you're talking about

363
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,519
so why do we use decibels to measure

364
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,680
light so it light like sound follows

365
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,600
what's called the inverse square law so

366
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,279
the signal is inversion inversely

367
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,800
proportional to the distance square so

368
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,720
for example if the signal travels

369
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,240
distance x and it loses half its

370
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,920
intensity and it travels another

371
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,959
distance x and it loses another half so

372
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,360
at 2x you're down to 25 percent at 3x

373
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
you're down to 12.5 percent et cetera so

374
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
if you use a lot of a logarithmic scale

375
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,639
to express this it lets you do your math

376
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,399
with addition and subtraction so that

377
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,920
anyone can do it you don't have to stop

378
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,399
and get a calculator and think very hard

379
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,320
so

380
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,200
here is a table that you can look at for

381
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,519
a handy reference as to what that means

382
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,440
so by the time you're down in the you

383
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,160
know minus 50 that's when you're 99.999

384
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,760
percent but even down into -30

385
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,519
that's that's pretty effectively a dead

386
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
signal that that is pretty useless

387
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,760
you see it falls off very quickly

388
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,240
so a big problem that we run into when

389
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
we work with signals over fiber is

390
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,639
dispersion so dispersion simply means to

391
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,240
spread out

392
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,600
and there's many different kinds of

393
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,839
dispersion but in the end it results in

394
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,760
signal degradation you end up not being

395
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
able to distinguish what was a one and

396
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,440
what was a zero

397
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,959
so in optics the the ones we're

398
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,040
primarily concerned with are what's

399
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,480
called chromatic dispersion and

400
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,120
polarization mode dispersion so

401
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,040
chromatic dispersion is what happens

402
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
when different frequencies of light

403
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,639
propagate through a non-vacuum at

404
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,320
different speeds

405
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,079
so that's that's less of a problem if

406
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,000
your channel one is propagating slower

407
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
than your channel two but it's more of a

408
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
problem if channel one itself the start

409
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,160
of the signal propagates differently

410
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,600
than the end of the signal that's where

411
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,920
you you need that to be

412
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,079
fixed so you can decode it

413
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,240
so historically chromatic dispersions

414
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,839
has been one of the biggest limiting

415
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,000
factors in everything that we've done in

416
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,920
optical especially uh in what's called

417
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,360
nrz uh signaling direct detect uh so the

418
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
faster your symbol rates the faster your

419
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,880
baud rate the faster you transition

420
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,839
between ones and zeros uh the wider your

421
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,880
signal line widths and so the the impact

422
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,959
of chromatic dispersion uh increases at

423
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,880
the square of the baud rate so

424
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
historically uh we we really kind of

425
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,399
limited ourselves to 10 gig because of

426
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,320
chromatic dispersion for quite a while

427
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,959
so that's why we went through these all

428
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,440
all the way up to 160 by 10 gig wdm

429
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
systems uh until

430
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,199
we we found ways to solve that but it's

431
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
it's still a pretty limiting factor it's

432
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
uh it's the reason that we don't have

433
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,720
15 50 100 gig signals uh very easily uh

434
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,360
and a lot of of optics and i'll talk

435
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,279
more about this later but um so we

436
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,040
measure chromatic dispersion in what's

437
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,240
called picoseconds per nanometer um

438
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,199
and it

439
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,720
yeah that's the gist of it so

440
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
polarization mode dispersion is the kind

441
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,639
of dispersion that happens when

442
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,880
different polarizations of light so

443
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
remember light is a

444
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,120
wave-ish propagating through space and

445
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,440
it can wave this way or it can wave this

446
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,079
way and if the fiber is not a perfect

447
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,240
cylindrical shape you end up with

448
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,480
different polarizations propagating at

449
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,920
different speeds

450
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,680
so this is what's in technical terms

451
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,320
called dgd differential group delay and

452
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,639
that's just measured in picoseconds uh

453
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,639
so this this can become a problem

454
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,880
usually it's not a problem for a very

455
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,720
long time until it is a problem and then

456
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
it becomes a very severe problem uh so

457
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,040
for example a lot of the early early

458
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,639
early fiber that was deployed in like

459
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,600
the early 80s that wasn't properly

460
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,160
shielded where they had water get inside

461
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,399
freeze kind of compress the fiber and

462
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,880
make it non-non-cylindrical

463
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
those fibers are not able to carry

464
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,880
modern high-speed signals as a result

465
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,800
but for the most part you you don't run

466
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
into this until you get into something a

467
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,320
little more interested and complicated

468
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,040
in the in the modern world

469
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
so fiber has a bunch of different

470
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,360
transmission bands so there's four

471
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
really three that that we typically deal

472
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,920
with and four and even beyond if you

473
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,279
want to look for

474
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,199
new ways to use fiber

475
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,279
so the the first one that we talk about

476
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,000
is 850. so this is

477
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
the band of highest attenuation but it's

478
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
it's one that works and it works well

479
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,279
for cheap optics in some cases you don't

480
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,199
even need lasers

481
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,079
you can use leds diodes you can do do

482
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,279
different things

483
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,199
but it's it's the the really short reach

484
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,199
really cheap and easy kind of a signal

485
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,959
and this this typically falls into

486
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,720
multi-mode at this point

487
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,839
um 1310 is

488
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,679
what's called o-band uh the original

489
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,799
band

490
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,599
and so this is the point of lowest

491
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,599
dispersion for classic single mode fiber

492
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,599
so this is your your intermediate reach

493
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,520
applications your two to ten kilometer

494
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,319
kind of stuff uh though we're seeing in

495
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,000
in modern like 100 gig optics for

496
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,960
example uh you have 1310 signals because

497
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,640
you need your your baud rate has

498
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,559
increased so much that you need to be

499
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,960
very close to 1310 and so we put more

500
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,280
and more effort into taking 1310 further

501
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,120
so you can you can take 1310 in some

502
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,039
cases do 80 kilometers with extreme

503
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,600
amplification but historically the the

504
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,039
cheap optics the ones that are mostly

505
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,200
out there uh it's it's the intermediate

506
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,799
reach uh role

507
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,919
um and then you have 1550 uh so this is

508
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,840
a chunk called c band so it covers

509
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,600
between 15 30 to 1565 and 1550 is the

510
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
center frequency so we just when we have

511
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,720
to reference it we reference it by the

512
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,240
center frequency

513
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
and this is the the area of fiber that

514
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,320
has the lowest rate of attenuation so

515
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,200
the signal itself is law it has has

516
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
lower loss

517
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,400
but it has more dispersion

518
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,280
so i'll i'll talk about why that matters

519
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,039
why dispersion matters but typically

520
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,520
this is the band that you use for your

521
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,080
dwdm applications anything long reach

522
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,000
anything high capacity uh pretty much

523
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,440
lives in this space

524
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,520
and then there's there's a band called

525
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
l-band which is very similar to c band

526
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,080
uh it's it's almost a mirror uh and it

527
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,000
works almost exactly the same way but

528
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,280
with slightly different physical

529
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,720
properties so

530
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,640
you use a different

531
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,679
dopant in your amplification to get the

532
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,280
same results but it kind of works the

533
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,960
same way and so for people that are

534
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,440
running very very high capacity systems

535
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,360
they will move into we'll just double

536
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,840
everything into l band

537
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,200
and and you can do that it works and

538
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,799
there's there's more exotic things out

539
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,720
there there's uh every you know

540
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,200
germanium doped things so you can go

541
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,640
into other bands there's all kinds of

542
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
stuff you can do but these are the ones

543
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,400
that make up the vast vast majority of

544
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,120
the commercial systems that you'll see

545
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,520
so here's a graph kind of showing

546
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,240
what the different bands are and and why

547
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,320
uh so if you look at the very top line

548
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
you look at the the early fiber it had

549
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,880
what's called water peak so there's

550
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
there's little hydroxyl molecules that

551
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,360
are inside the glass that absorb certain

552
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
frequencies of light and make certain

553
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,039
bands kind of unusable

554
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,960
and so you see that the the bands that

555
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,880
were picked were kind of work arounds

556
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,000
for those

557
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,760
those those water peaks and then you see

558
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,480
the evolution of fiber

559
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,720
so the modern fiber for the most part

560
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,640
doesn't really have that issue but it's

561
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,919
still

562
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,600
it's still there to some extent right

563
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,799
it's not unusable but it's uh of

564
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,960
less effect

565
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,080
uh and so when you're when you're

566
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,760
designing a system you know it might be

567
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,840
the difference between needing to put a

568
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,240
hut every 80 kilometers or every 60

569
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,760
kilometers which doesn't seem like it

570
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,039
would be that big a deal but that that

571
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,039
becomes really expensive really quickly

572
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,360
uh so you try to get the most efficiency

573
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,640
out of your fiber possible and that's

574
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
why we kind of target the bands that we

575
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,720
target

576
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,480
so another big thing that you you talk

577
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,760
about when you're dealing with optical

578
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,159
signals is something called the the osnr

579
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,320
the optical signal to noise ratio so

580
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,799
this this works uh like rf anything else

581
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,960
uh you have a you have a signal uh it

582
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,880
comes along certain certain strength and

583
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,720
power and then you have some background

584
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,960
noise and the background noise can be

585
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,120
uh leakage from other transponders it

586
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,799
can be spontaneous noise from

587
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,880
amplification but whatever it is when

588
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,720
that background noise you you look at

589
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
the ratio between the quality of the

590
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,400
signal and the background noise that

591
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,159
that is you know going to disturb that

592
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,039
signal

593
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,039
and if you look at modern long-haul

594
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,679
systems osnr is really the single most

595
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,120
limiting factor it's the the thing that

596
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,559
you care about the most and it's the

597
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,320
thing when you're designing your

598
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
transmission system that you're really

599
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,720
trying to to optimize and i'll talk more

600
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,760
about that

601
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,000
when we get into signals

602
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
uh so right now uh wave division

603
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
multiplexing

604
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,880
so

605
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,640
um

606
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
we know that light comes in different

607
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,720
colors uh what we perceive as white is a

608
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
mix of many different wavelengths but

609
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,960
what you can do inside of a fiber is

610
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
carry different signals at different

611
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,159
frequencies and they will in theory pass

612
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,760
each other not interfere with each other

613
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,919
and you're able to increase capacity by

614
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,159
adding more more channels so the goal is

615
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,520
to have a ships in the night approach

616
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
they're not they're not they're not

617
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,799
touching each other and you're just

618
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,640
adding more and more signal into the

619
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,720
fiber and then the reality is always

620
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,320
more complex

621
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,080
so there's there's a couple different

622
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
kinds of wdm um

623
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,039
the the simplest is what's called cwd on

624
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,000
a course wdm and really this is this is

625
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
kind of used to mean anything that's not

626
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,480
dwdm it can mean anything under the sun

627
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,280
so

628
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,200
there is a historic

629
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,799
cwdm meaning like 20 nanometer spacing

630
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,480
there were cwdm tuned optics there's uh

631
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,440
like cwdm4 kind of optics that are that

632
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,320
are four cwdm colors and a single qsfp

633
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,559
that are out there uh it's it's these

634
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,360
kind of very loose channels

635
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,200
and then they had uh you know you you

636
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,559
had like eight channels to start with

637
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,919
and then you had low water peak fiber

638
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,520
that opened up another 10 channels so

639
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,000
there's there's all of those things and

640
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,760
you'll see these in fiber of the home

641
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,960
you'll see these in in different

642
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,400
applications

643
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,799
but you can also use cwdm to refer to

644
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,280
what's called a 1310 1550 max and that's

645
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
you just take those two most common

646
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,960
bands and you put them together as a

647
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
very simple mux

648
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,799
cwdm really just means anything you

649
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,080
anything else

650
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,600
dwdm is the one that is well defined has

651
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,960
standards has has grids uh and really

652
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,880
means something so

653
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,320
there's an itu-t standard for it

654
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,080
so we talk about

655
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,400
dwdm channels we talk about

656
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,240
spacing so if i say here's 100 gigahertz

657
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,799
mux that means there is 100 gigahertz

658
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,720
spacing between center of channel and

659
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
center of channel so that defines how

660
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,559
many channels so uh older 200 gigahertz

661
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,080
so this is this is basically stuff that

662
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,840
you you haven't seen in the real world

663
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,440
world for a while but it's it's out

664
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,520
there in theory uh this was kind of the

665
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,200
original wdm technology and then 100

666
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,360
gigahertz is the stuff that is probably

667
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,520
still the most common it's used in metro

668
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,840
it's very cheap it's very commodity

669
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,480
so you end up with about 40 to 48

670
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,240
channels so technically you can get 48

671
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,159
channels uh but what ends up happening

672
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,320
is you can't really fit 48 lc connectors

673
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,039
on a 1u panel very well so people just

674
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,799
turn it down into 40 and they'll they'll

675
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,320
do it in various ways they'll clip the

676
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
ends or they'll do it in blocks

677
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,000
so if you do like a block of five

678
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
channels and you skip one then what

679
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,200
they'll let you do is you could have

680
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
different muxes you could have a mux

681
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,679
of band a and a mux of band b and you

682
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,120
skip that channel in the middle where

683
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,720
they might overlap and so you can take

684
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,960
multiple small muxes and feed up into

685
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,000
big ones

686
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,320
but for the most part it's that 40 to 48

687
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,080
channel thing

688
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,760
then you have the 50 gigahertz so if you

689
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
look at the evolution of the technology

690
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,360
where this went um

691
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,080
you went from 200 100 you went into 50

692
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,960
that's still still very very very very

693
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
common for your commercial systems your

694
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,840
long-haul systems um and we moved into

695
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
25 and this is right in the arrow when

696
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,080
we were trying to get as much capacity

697
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,320
but we were limited in our technology um

698
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,080
and the only thing that we could do was

699
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,320
add more and more and more 10 gigs and

700
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,080
you saw that move very briefly and then

701
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,000
you saw that back away and so the the

702
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
modern way that we handle this the way

703
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,720
that works is uh you actually have very

704
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,240
you have coherence i'll talk all about

705
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,679
that technology but you have these very

706
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,679
wide channels that are using wider and

707
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,440
wider bands

708
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,760
and that's how you're able to to step up

709
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,679
the signal so we've moved back into a

710
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,039
world where

711
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,200
most modern signals require something

712
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,000
like 62.5 70 75 gigahertz so we've moved

713
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,720
into what's called flex grid so in a

714
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,320
modern system there's not these hard

715
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,919
defined channels of this mux that you

716
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,440
put in once and hope that it stays there

717
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,760
for 10 years uh you have the ability to

718
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,320
to map the channels however you want

719
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
with varying degrees of cost and pain

720
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,760
associated with that so here's a kind of

721
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,919
comparison looking at

722
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,840
the different different channel sizes

723
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,679
just so you get an idea so you see the

724
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,200
entire c band

725
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,080
where you can have 80 160 channels

726
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
and how small that is compared to you

727
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,960
know two cwdm bands

728
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,640
so it gives you an idea of kind of the

729
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
perspective of these things

730
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,480
so what are the advantages to each so

731
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,720
cwdm the whole point here is that you

732
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,279
get to use these cheaper less precisely

733
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,159
mostly cooled lasers so the signal

734
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,000
itself isn't actually anywhere you're

735
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,799
not transmitting light at 20 gigahertz

736
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,600
of of spectrum

737
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,760
what you're doing is the the signal is

738
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,320
free to wander around and so you don't

739
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,080
have to spend as much money on your

740
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,919
cooling system to keep the laser as

741
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,520
precisely tuned

742
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,880
and cooling actually ends up being a

743
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,200
significant component of the cost of of

744
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
the optics and how that works

745
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,760
so dwdm obviously you get far more

746
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,720
channels

747
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,760
you get much better engineering you get

748
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,279
you get to stay completely in the c band

749
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,960
so the advantage of staying in c band is

750
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,279
that's where you have uh amplification

751
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,880
through what's called an edfa an erbium

752
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,960
doped fiber amplifier um but yeah that's

753
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,880
that's that's the gist of it and why you

754
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,000
use it

755
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,240
um so remember i talked about all the

756
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,760
other different kinds of of waived

757
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,679
vision multiplexing so

758
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,799
um

759
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,919
you've got that 1310 1550 mux you have

760
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,039
four lane gray optics so for example

761
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,279
usually the way this works is whenever

762
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,039
you move into a new speed so you you

763
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,400
move from

764
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,559
10 gig or 40 gig to 100 gig or you move

765
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,480
from 100 gig to 400 gig the way that it

766
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,240
works early on is you don't actually

767
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,159
have a native 100 gig signal you don't

768
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,799
actually have a native 400 gig signal so

769
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,120
what you'll do is you'll have multiple

770
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,360
lanes both electrically and optically

771
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,159
that get combined to make that signal

772
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,559
so for example when uh when 10 gig first

773
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,400
came out we did we didn't really have

774
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,039
the technology to cheaply easily do

775
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,360
a whole 10 gig signal but we could very

776
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,520
easily do four 2.5 and so we had a

777
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,559
standard called lx4 40 gig uh when you

778
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,120
look at 40 gig lr4 what that actually is

779
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,240
is four 10 gig lambdas uh talking

780
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,320
electrically out four electrical

781
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,520
connectors 100 gig lr4 same thing uh

782
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,200
they they made the grid a little bit

783
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
tighter because they have to stay very

784
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,200
close to that 1310 but it's the the same

785
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,360
jest you you have these four lanes as

786
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,440
you move into to 400 gig you see a lot

787
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,520
of very similar stuff happening

788
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,360
and then you also have what's called

789
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
single strand bx or bi-directional

790
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,640
optics and so this is uh you you take

791
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,080
two frequencies that are slightly

792
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,120
different because if they're if they're

793
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,880
the exact same frequency you can you can

794
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,240
have interference from reflections but

795
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,000
you take two different frequencies and

796
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,399
you put them over the same cable and so

797
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,840
this can let you either work with a

798
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,600
single strand system or it can let you

799
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,279
double your capacity without having to

800
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,120
install a mux rack anything cable

801
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,080
anything

802
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,760
so you'll you'll see a lot of those used

803
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,919
in the wild

804
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:10,720
so

805
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
when talk a minute about the the channel

806
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,480
terminology because this this starts to

807
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,240
matter as we look at the the real

808
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,960
details of dwdm and wdm in general and

809
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
how it works so remember when i said we

810
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,960
talk about 100 gigahertz mux that's the

811
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,520
channel spacing that's from zero to zero

812
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
uh so you also have the channel pass

813
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,360
band that's the total amount of signal

814
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,880
that is sent

815
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,679
before you start to be clipped by the

816
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,120
edge of the mux

817
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,200
and then the other channels that are

818
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,159
nearby

819
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,000
and so you'll have you'll have different

820
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,200
levels of interference you'll have

821
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
adjacent channel isolation so what's

822
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,120
what's the amount of signal that i get

823
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,279
before the next channel over starts to

824
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,640
interfere and then what's the amount of

825
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,880
isolation that i get for the entire

826
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,320
system and the other you know 30

827
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,399
channels that are sitting over here

828
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,520
and these these start to add up

829
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,880
so

830
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,679
what's inside a mux

831
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,440
it's really cool because it's a it's a

832
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,320
really simple passive unpowered device

833
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
that combines or splits multiple colors

834
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,559
of light from a common fiber

835
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,720
so it's short for multiplexer uh you'll

836
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,200
hear it called a filter or a prism so a

837
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,120
filter is how it actually works you you

838
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,960
take light and you kind of filter it out

839
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,919
but people kind of understand

840
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,440
conceptually that a prism takes light

841
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,919
and sprints it so

842
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,760
you'll see that but a complete system

843
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,080
requires two units you need a mux and a

844
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,840
demux for the tx and the rx and usually

845
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
you'll see that sold as a package

846
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,159
uh but like if you crack open one of

847
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,520
these little boxes you'll see that

848
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,919
there's there's two individual units uh

849
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,480
there's a tx and an rx and that's how

850
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,279
you're you're doing it

851
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,440
another kind of passive component that

852
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,520
is is really fundamental to a lot of

853
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,360
things is what's called an oadm an

854
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,200
optical add drop multiplexer so what

855
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,520
you're doing here is you're selectively

856
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,600
adding or dropping certain channels

857
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,919
without disturbing the other channels

858
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,360
that are nearby

859
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,000
so muxes are are what's your your big

860
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
endpoint it's where you break out all of

861
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,039
the channels an oadm tends to be a node

862
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,360
on a ring where for example you want to

863
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,600
you want to access a channel 2 channel 4

864
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,360
channel whatever that is but you want to

865
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,760
let the other 30 40 50 80 whatever

866
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,080
channels go by untouched

867
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,320
so it ends up looking like this

868
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
you have a component called a circulator

869
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,000
an fpg and talk more about them in a

870
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,120
second and that lets you add and drop

871
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,600
that channel uh without disturbing the

872
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,840
others

873
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,760
um the way that we do this there's

874
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,440
there's a couple different technologies

875
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,399
so an fbg is what's called a fiber brag

876
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,559
grating and this is is pretty cool

877
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,880
technology because what's happening is

878
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,039
you use a really powerful ultraviolet

879
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,720
laser and it

880
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,880
etches it literally etches little

881
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,520
patterns into the fiber in very specific

882
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,159
ways and what that does is it causes

883
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,960
reflections so if a light of a certain

884
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,880
target frequency comes in

885
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,720
and it hits this fpg it will be

886
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
reflected and if it's not that target

887
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,640
frequency it will be passed and so this

888
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,600
is a fundamental building block of a lot

889
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,519
of other components

890
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,559
and it is used for for tons of things

891
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,600
you have another technology called tff

892
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,440
thin film filter

893
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,679
so this is this is common commonly used

894
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,640
in your like 16 channel count muxes

895
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,200
um it's it's out there but it's it's not

896
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,360
as pervasive as it used to be

897
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,519
and then the big one for high capacity

898
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,760
systems is what's called an awg and a

899
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,000
raid waveguide grading

900
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,480
so what's happening here is you have

901
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,440
literally two big prisms

902
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,840
and you are you're taking the signal and

903
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,360
you're spreading it out and you're

904
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,799
letting it constructively and

905
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,120
destructively interfere with each other

906
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,799
this big long strand of fiber that goes

907
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,120
certain measured precise distances and

908
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,679
when it all recombines in a certain way

909
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,919
it's broken out into all these channels

910
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,519
so it's a really cool amount of

911
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,519
engineering that goes into it

912
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,039
it's usually a black box that no one

913
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,559
ever opens because once it's out of the

914
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,360
factory you'll never be able to touch it

915
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,159
but

916
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,679
the modern systems are what's called an

917
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,240
aawg and a thermal system so you don't

918
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,760
need to cool it doesn't need power

919
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,440
doesn't need monitoring nothing it's

920
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,840
it's literally just a passive device and

921
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
these are what you use for your higher

922
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,760
higher account systems

923
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,720
and so as you move beyond 40 channels so

924
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,640
if you move into an 80 channel 96

925
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,960
channel system typically what that is is

926
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,840
two 40 48 channel systems stacked on top

927
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,960
of each other uh but so the the 40 48

928
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
kind of channel count is the fundamental

929
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,080
building block of that space

930
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,320
so then we move into a thing called a

931
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,440
reconfigurable oadm or a rotom so think

932
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,200
of this as a just an oadm

933
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,960
but something that you can configure in

934
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,279
software so typically that's built

935
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,080
around a component called a wss a

936
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,320
wavelength selective switch

937
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,760
and there's a couple ways you can do

938
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,240
that uh you can there's the two basic

939
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,519
architectures are what's called a

940
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,919
broadcast and select so

941
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,320
you you take your signal and you split

942
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,640
it and you just broadcast it to every

943
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,960
possible direction and then you have a

944
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
wss on the other side that picks out the

945
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,880
one that you care about and discard the

946
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,000
rest

947
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,919
and then the more sophisticated version

948
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,679
is the route and select not so you have

949
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,159
a wss on both ends so you're you're

950
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,399
actively controlling what you send and

951
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,399
what you select and receive

952
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,200
uh and it lets you do

953
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
dynamic channel mapping so this is where

954
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,799
you you get to sit in a knock and have a

955
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,559
pretty gui and click a button and move a

956
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,720
wavelength across the country and it's

957
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
it's lovely uh but there's a lot of

958
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,080
downsides to that it's it's very

959
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,840
expensive there's a lot of amplification

960
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,679
there's a lot of very complex components

961
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,159
that go into this uh they're at this

962
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,840
point very difficult to get because of

963
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,159
supply chain

964
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,640
so when we talk about rotoms

965
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,799
you'll hear a terminology called rotom's

966
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,679
degrees so a degree is basically a

967
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,200
possible direction that it can be

968
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,360
steered so if i'm sitting on a switch

969
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,480
and i can go

970
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,120
north south east or west that's a

971
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,199
four degree rotem

972
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,040
and what will happen is people will

973
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,480
design systems where you can you can

974
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,560
just add another card and you can expand

975
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,918
your degrees

976
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,320
and the way that works is every every

977
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,918
degree every possible avenue of

978
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,719
selection is this this wavelength

979
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,800
selective switch

980
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,839
and a big big mesh so you end up one

981
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,679
degree has to have a big fiber meshed

982
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,520
every other degree and so as this

983
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,359
expands you end up with this big giant

984
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,359
fiber spaghetti and you have to create

985
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,440
uh all kinds of

986
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,760
things to optimize that but that's

987
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,918
that's how it works inside it's it's a

988
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,440
big pile of i want to take this

989
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,800
wavelength and send it there i want to

990
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,560
take this wavelength and send it there

991
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,679
so

992
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,239
the the regular the classic oadm or what

993
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,679
people call a fixed oadm or a photo

994
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,240
the way that that works is you you go

995
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,920
out and deploy it and you don't get to

996
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,520
change it so it's really great for

997
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,920
let's say you build a 10 node ring and

998
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,240
you have 40 channels and so every node

999
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,599
is going to get four channels right

1000
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,680
give or take so

1001
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,839
if that's enough capacity for you if

1002
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,000
you're the one controlling the capacity

1003
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,200
it's a really cheap effective way to do

1004
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,760
high bandwidth and you can you know i've

1005
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,880
got

1006
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,640
four channels going to this node over

1007
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,079
here and i've got four channels going to

1008
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,079
this node over here and so i'm i'm great

1009
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,160
i can work with that but if you're

1010
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,599
selling to customers and you're trying

1011
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,040
to sell wavelengths and so all of a

1012
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,880
sudden this node over here gets blows up

1013
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,320
becomes really popular and this node

1014
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
over here uh

1015
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,599
isn't very popular and doesn't get a lot

1016
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,440
of business that's where you'll spend

1017
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,880
all of your your time

1018
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,480
redeploying hardware in the field and

1019
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,680
trying to optimize that and so that's

1020
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,160
where you move into the world of a rotom

1021
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,079
uh so you can you can kind of scale that

1022
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,000
up on demand so it's it's you're you're

1023
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,160
striking the balance between the most

1024
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,400
efficiency and the price per bit versus

1025
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
the most efficiency in the i want to be

1026
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,119
able to deliver any capacity to any

1027
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,200
point between any point and if you're

1028
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,480
willing to make that trade off if you're

1029
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,880
willing to say well i know that i have a

1030
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,400
hub that all of my capacity is going to

1031
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,040
go to i don't want random node over here

1032
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,119
sending 100 terabits to random node over

1033
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,599
there that's when you move into into

1034
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,520
different designs

1035
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,760
so the evolution of the roadm is is kind

1036
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,680
of interesting because you can see

1037
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
it's getting more and more complex over

1038
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,680
the the year so your basic rotom

1039
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,720
it's it's literally it's a wss that then

1040
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,400
goes to a mux

1041
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,359
so

1042
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,880
you say i'm in a node here and i want to

1043
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,240
send something north i want to send

1044
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,520
something someone send something west

1045
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,200
what that actually breaks out into is

1046
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,760
here's my 40 channel fixed mux

1047
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,599
and so i plug i want to use channel one

1048
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,280
i plug something into channel one i run

1049
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,040
a cable i run it into an optic channel

1050
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,880
one it's very fixed

1051
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,079
um and that that is the cheapest way to

1052
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,320
do it uh but you obviously it's very

1053
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,920
difficult if you want to add capacity

1054
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,200
you're sending people out in the field

1055
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,640
you're plugging in cables you're moving

1056
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,800
stuff it can be a real pain

1057
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,599
so

1058
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,119
we move into

1059
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,520
the world of a colorless rotom

1060
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,280
and when you're doing coherent signals

1061
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,920
you you don't actually need to

1062
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,320
put channel one into a mux that's

1063
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,920
labeled channel one that goes to an

1064
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,079
optic that's channel one uh you can

1065
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,839
actually your your optic itself is

1066
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,680
dynamically tunable so you can you can

1067
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,280
make the optic behave in whatever

1068
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
frequency you want it to

1069
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,040
and you can plug it into

1070
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,200
not a mux but a splitter because a

1071
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,119
coherent signal can kind of lock on to

1072
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,560
the signal that it cares about and

1073
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,880
discard all the others so

1074
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,359
that was the the early generation of of

1075
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,240
this colorless rotom

1076
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,760
was that you you had that level of

1077
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,800
flexibility you didn't have to go out

1078
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,560
and re-cable the the optic every time

1079
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,320
you wanted to do stuff and then the

1080
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,839
modern version of this is what's called

1081
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,400
a cdc rotom so it stands for colorless

1082
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
directionless and contentionless so

1083
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,320
colorless means obviously any channel

1084
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,160
can be dropped on any port

1085
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,320
directionless means any channel can be

1086
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,800
sent in any direction and contentionless

1087
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,280
means you can reuse the same channel

1088
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,839
across multiple pieces of the rotum

1089
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,119
itself and you're not going to be

1090
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,480
blocked because

1091
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,200
this path over here is using it

1092
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,520
your rotom itself is not not blocking

1093
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,839
your ability to consume every channel on

1094
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,520
every line system

1095
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,680
these are the most powerful but also the

1096
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,399
most expensive

1097
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,880
so what's what's the point the the whole

1098
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,359
point of the cdc rotom and where they're

1099
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,359
trying to go in the space is to make

1100
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,960
this something that you can dynamically

1101
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,440
control in software so imagine you know

1102
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,599
you've got a transponder

1103
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,680
that you could repurpose so at one point

1104
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,599
of the day you might turn up capacity

1105
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,119
towards asia and then later in the day

1106
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,480
you might turn up capacity towards

1107
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,320
europe and you can dynamically move that

1108
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,160
around without having to buy two

1109
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,839
transponders and have a bunch of idle

1110
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,079
capacity sitting around

1111
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,640
so you're looking for that evolution of

1112
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,599
and so

1113
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,520
where this moves into is is something

1114
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,560
called

1115
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,240
originally it was called gmpls

1116
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,200
generalized mpls uh and it moves into a

1117
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,040
new technology called pcap path

1118
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,280
computation element protocol so you're

1119
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
you're taking the elements of traffic

1120
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,200
engineering that you would do in mpls

1121
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,720
that you wouldn't do in segment routing

1122
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,560
where you say i know that this router

1123
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,880
needs to send 50 gigabits to that router

1124
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,480
and you're tying it into the optical

1125
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,160
layer so the optical layer can now

1126
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,960
respond to that dynamic traffic use and

1127
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,880
go okay i need to spin up another

1128
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,240
transponder

1129
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,400
and there's varying degrees of success

1130
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,480
on that uh but that's that's where the

1131
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,079
industry is trying to push towards

1132
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,839
that's that's what uh the modern life

1133
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,599
systems are built for

1134
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,720
um

1135
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,800
and it's it's it definitely has its

1136
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
advantages

1137
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,560
but what actually goes on inside of a

1138
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,119
modern cdc rotom well here's here's kind

1139
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,280
of a breakdown so you come into this

1140
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,160
thing

1141
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,920
first thing you have to do amplify your

1142
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,040
signal

1143
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,520
you amplify and then you go into a wss

1144
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,839
you go through like a 1 by 20 wss and

1145
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,320
that's going to take a huge signal hit

1146
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,839
so as soon as you come out of that you

1147
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,599
have to go into another amp

1148
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,319
and remember you have to every possible

1149
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,560
wss exit has to go to another degree so

1150
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,480
if you've got a 1 by 20 you've got this

1151
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,440
big mesh of you need you need an array

1152
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,960
of amplifiers you have these high

1153
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,160
density multi-channel amplifier arrays

1154
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,839
that you take the signal you amp it you

1155
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,319
you steer it you send it over here then

1156
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,440
you send it out what's called a

1157
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,200
multicast switch

1158
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,880
so you you take this thing and you

1159
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,280
broadcast you split it 16 ways and you

1160
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,040
send it down to a thing and you

1161
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,280
it's very very complicated and you're

1162
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,839
doing a lot of amplification a lot of

1163
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:36,720
times

1164
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,119
so that's that that trade-off of you get

1165
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,440
that dynamic i can just sit in a click a

1166
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,800
button and move a wavelength and

1167
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,880
everything is great but you paid for it

1168
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,440
both in cost complexity and

1169
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,319
optical signal

1170
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,040
one thing that you'll hear talked about

1171
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,440
uh is what's called a super channel

1172
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,200
and that's that's what happens when you

1173
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,280
want to deliver uh something that is

1174
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,359
bigger than what a single carrier can

1175
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,680
deliver so you use a super channel to

1176
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,599
kind of pack multiple carriers together

1177
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,119
and so you can think about it as a

1178
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,040
single as a single channel

1179
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,440
but this is an example of let's say you

1180
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,160
wanted to send

1181
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,240
a one terabit this is this is an old

1182
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,079
slide but you know if you wanted to do

1183
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,000
this with a single single carrier you

1184
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,119
need a 320 gigabot system just

1185
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,040
impossibly complex doesn't exist not

1186
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,000
going to happen

1187
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,079
but what you can do is split that up

1188
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,040
into multiple different carriers

1189
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,720
pack them very tightly you can even

1190
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
treat them as here's a really big

1191
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,560
channel but inside of it is multiple

1192
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,720
subcarriers and and that's actually

1193
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,319
becoming more of an evolution of

1194
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,040
technology and you see the same thing in

1195
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,960
in 4g and 5g where what's actually

1196
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,160
happening is you have many different

1197
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,000
subcarriers and each subcarrier can

1198
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,240
react to the different properties of the

1199
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,560
medium you're seeing that direction

1200
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,800
happen in fiber so fiber fiber usually

1201
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,560
ends up being 10 years behind whatever's

1202
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,079
happening in rf

1203
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,680
you see the same kind of progression

1204
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,359
happening in fiber where hey we can work

1205
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,359
with many different smaller smaller

1206
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,880
signals and that's where things will go

1207
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,960
over time

1208
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,920
so remember i said early on it was about

1209
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,000
fixed channel sizes and so it didn't

1210
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,599
really matter what you sent it was going

1211
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,440
to be like here's a 50 gigahertz grid

1212
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,920
and maybe you send a a one gig signal

1213
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,680
through maybe you send a 10 gig maybe

1214
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,599
you send 100 maybe you send wide channel

1215
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,760
maybe it's narrow it doesn't matter it

1216
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,240
is what it is and in a modern system uh

1217
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,640
flex grid system you can dynamically

1218
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,599
tune

1219
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,040
you know down into the very small

1220
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,760
increments so you've got a really big

1221
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,599
wide modern signal you can accommodate

1222
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,720
it you've got a whole bunch of small

1223
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,960
older signals you can accommodate it

1224
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,720
the downside to that is once again

1225
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,680
complexity and cost so flex grid systems

1226
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,520
you know a passive mux can be on the

1227
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,359
order of hundreds to you know thousand

1228
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,440
dollars a flex grid system can be ten

1229
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,599
times that or more and it's deeply

1230
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,839
integrated into your complex rotoms and

1231
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,040
everything else

1232
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,280
uh so you there's a trade-off

1233
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,680
um so other optical components that are

1234
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,000
out there

1235
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,560
so dispersion compensation

1236
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,920
so remember i've said dispersion you've

1237
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,520
got your signal it's spread out and so

1238
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,480
now you need to to do something with it

1239
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,720
the early generations the of how this

1240
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,319
was done which is just a big spool of

1241
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,079
fiber inside a box and this fiber was

1242
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,760
engineered to do the opposite of

1243
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,680
whatever the line fiber was so when the

1244
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,280
light fiber would spread the signal out

1245
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,440
the the fiber in a spool would compress

1246
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,680
it back together and you oh i just sent

1247
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,680
it over a 50 kilometer span i put a big

1248
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,240
spool of like a seven kilometer thing of

1249
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,480
fiber that's designed to to fix 50

1250
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,000
kilometers worth of dispersion it comes

1251
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,400
out the end and there you go and so that

1252
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,160
ends up adding something like 20 percent

1253
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
to your fiber distance increases latency

1254
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,640
needs more amplification etc

1255
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,520
and then the the way that newer designs

1256
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,640
handle this is through an fpg so you

1257
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,920
design your your brag grading

1258
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,400
to to actually cause or correct

1259
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,079
dispersion as it's reflecting the signal

1260
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,880
um

1261
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,599
the nice thing about that is that it it

1262
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,040
um

1263
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,760
you know it's very it's no latency hit

1264
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,240
there's less uh less

1265
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,839
power loss there's all of these nice

1266
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:10,720
things

1267
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,440
the downside is that it's not as easy to

1268
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,520
do wide channels

1269
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,760
so in a modern world where you have

1270
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,680
wider and wider channels doing higher

1271
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,359
and higher gigabots it becomes

1272
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,200
increasingly difficult to work with that

1273
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,400
design

1274
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,160
so you move into

1275
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,240
tunable dispersion compensation you

1276
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,000
basically have

1277
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
heated or cooled components that are

1278
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,640
that are causing slight variations

1279
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,040
in how the fpga is working and but it's

1280
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,400
it's ultimately like i said it's very

1281
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,720
difficult uh whereas if you've got the

1282
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,400
the fiber spool it's this nice smooth

1283
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,079
slope you can send whatever signal you

1284
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,920
want you don't have to be aligned to a

1285
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,880
specific grid whereas the fbg is

1286
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,960
actually created on a specific grid and

1287
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,160
your signal has to be be aligned to that

1288
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,400
so optical switches are these cool

1289
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
little components

1290
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
and you can do this mechanically too but

1291
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,520
the the ones that are actually

1292
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,520
interesting are the the little micro

1293
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,240
mirrors and 3d mem stuff uh so basically

1294
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,599
you you have this big grid and these

1295
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,160
little micro mirrors and you can through

1296
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,680
software click a button and it will

1297
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,760
steer the mirror and it will move the

1298
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,280
light so that it goes from port 1 to

1299
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,560
port 2.

1300
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,319
and so you'll see these in products

1301
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,839
these are these are great in labs these

1302
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,880
are great in lights out environment

1303
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,160
where you have to go out and re-cable

1304
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,920
things constantly they tend to be too

1305
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,000
expensive to do in production in most

1306
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,359
systems

1307
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,200
uh but you'll you'll see them as

1308
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,920
components inside of other things so

1309
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
even even something as simple as like a

1310
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
one by two or a two by four switch where

1311
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,960
you you literally just go a or b uh you

1312
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,440
pair that with a 50 50 splitter and so

1313
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,119
you can get a

1314
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,119
i have two fiber pads and i will use

1315
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,200
whichever one is working at any given

1316
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,119
moment very simply very cheaply and

1317
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,040
without having to add a lot of cost to

1318
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,960
your transponder so you'll see them in

1319
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,760
all kinds of applications

1320
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,160
so the wss

1321
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,000
this is this is a really complex

1322
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,839
interesting high engineering component

1323
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,640
uh you've got these little micro mirrors

1324
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,920
you've got these liquid crystals and

1325
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,920
silicon things um it's beyond what

1326
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,680
would normally be addressed at nano but

1327
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,440
just understand that these are these are

1328
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,119
the components that are going on inside

1329
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,200
of a wss to make this possible so that

1330
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,240
you can steer your wavelengths

1331
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,640
a circulator is a cool component that

1332
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,640
you pretty much never see as an end user

1333
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,160
but so you know what's happening so the

1334
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,800
way a circulator works is um there's

1335
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,880
three ports and so something comes in

1336
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,800
port one goes out port two something

1337
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
comes in port two it goes out port three

1338
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,240
well why would you want that well you

1339
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,800
take that and you pair that with an fpg

1340
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,200
and that's how you get your oadms and a

1341
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,440
lot of these other components so you see

1342
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,599
an fpg the way that that works that tiny

1343
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,040
little etched piece of fiber that will

1344
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,960
reflect a certain signal if it's

1345
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,040
reflected it'll come back to my

1346
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,880
circulator and i'll drop it and i'll be

1347
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,800
able to consume it in this network if

1348
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,800
it's not reflected then i pass it on and

1349
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,240
that's an oadm

1350
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,240
um so like i said it's it's just an

1351
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,839
internal component but it's when you

1352
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,440
start to think about how these things

1353
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,359
are designed and what they're aiming to

1354
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,160
do

1355
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,720
it's good to know what it is

1356
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,680
so optical splitters are uh they do

1357
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,760
exactly what they sound like they do

1358
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,839
they split a signal uh so some really

1359
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,599
common examples of that so uh like i

1360
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,839
said a 50 50 splitter so you you take

1361
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,680
your signal and you literally just split

1362
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,000
it three db and you send half of it this

1363
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,839
way and half of it this way and you just

1364
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,680
on the other end you have a switch

1365
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,280
looking at it and it goes i will use

1366
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,680
whichever signal is strongest and so you

1367
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,359
get that easy cheap failover into a

1368
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,599
building without having to deploy a lot

1369
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,000
of other complicated systems uh you'll

1370
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,040
have a 99 one and 98 to a 95 five

1371
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,240
splitter

1372
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,920
these are your your optical performance

1373
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,000
monitoring so what will happen here is

1374
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
so you let's say you tap five percent of

1375
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,040
the signal

1376
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,720
as you're going through your ed fuzz

1377
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,000
you're going through your mux whatever

1378
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,079
it is you can do things like you can

1379
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,440
come along and plug in a spectrum

1380
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,200
analyzer and see what's happening you

1381
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,559
can actually have little spectrum

1382
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,800
analyzers integrated into your gear so

1383
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,040
you can look at what signals are going

1384
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,800
across my network what's the os and r

1385
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,720
what's the quality what's the what's the

1386
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,359
power are they balanced um

1387
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,599
it's it's really cool uh obviously you

1388
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,520
pay for that but it gives you a lot of

1389
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,000
flexibility in your engineering

1390
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,319
and then you'll you'll have um like a

1391
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,400
one by n so typically this is powers of

1392
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,880
two and this is like a a multi-point

1393
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,440
distribution

1394
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,760
uh so for example used in cable tv

1395
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,040
you'll have like a 1 by 32 splitter

1396
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,960
uh and what's happening here is you

1397
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,640
literally it's broadcast and so you you

1398
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,800
take the signal you you have a very

1399
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,720
powerful amp and then you split it 32

1400
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,960
ways and you send it out to 32 different

1401
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,960
units

1402
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,880
um so now i'm going to talk about

1403
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,119
optical amplification which is really

1404
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,440
complex and really interesting and and

1405
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,960
pretty fundamental to everything that we

1406
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,559
do in optics

1407
00:48:58,559 --> 00:48:59,359
so

1408
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,680
the point of an optical amplifier is a

1409
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,599
way to increase the intensity of the

1410
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,280
signal so you you had a light it got

1411
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,720
dimmer now you need to make it bright

1412
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,480
again but you don't actually want to

1413
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,160
take that light decode it into

1414
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,280
electrical and then re-encode it

1415
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,839
because that turns out to be very

1416
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,640
expensive so

1417
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,040
there's different kinds of amplifiers

1418
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,559
that you'll you'll hear

1419
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,839
you'll hear things talked about as

1420
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,520
boosters preamps and lines and these

1421
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,200
aren't these aren't really strict roles

1422
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,400
there's there's not actually a

1423
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,599
difference like this is a different

1424
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,760
technology for a booster it's it's a

1425
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,160
slight variant in how they're built and

1426
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,880
so you'll have an edfa or an amplifier

1427
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,680
that's

1428
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,599
better in this role or better in this

1429
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,440
role but it's ultimately up to you as

1430
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,200
the network that you're building as to

1431
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,520
what you do with it and why

1432
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,640
so a booster is designed for

1433
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,480
high total so you put that a booster

1434
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,839
when you're transmitting so you've got a

1435
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,359
signal coming you want to make it as hot

1436
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,200
as possible before you put it out in the

1437
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,960
line there's your booster

1438
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,599
a preamp is what you have on the receive

1439
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,119
side so you've you've got a signal

1440
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,640
coming in it's kind of weak you want to

1441
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,319
make it brighter so that you can decode

1442
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,240
it easier

1443
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,040
it's designed for that low low power

1444
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,359
level low noise and an inline is just

1445
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,119
something that kind of strikes a balance

1446
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,960
in the middle and it's designed not to

1447
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,880
really decode the signal but then to

1448
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,960
just amplify it and pass it on to uh to

1449
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,119
another node

1450
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,280
so the way that this works uh the most

1451
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,040
common kind of amplification that's out

1452
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,280
there is what's called an edfa erbium

1453
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,440
doped fiber amplifier so the way this

1454
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,720
works

1455
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,040
you have a little piece of fiber and

1456
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,880
it's not very big it can be 10 meters

1457
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,240
something like that

1458
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,839
in this little piece of fiber they come

1459
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,040
along and they dope so in the

1460
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,599
manufacturing process they have snuck in

1461
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,720
a couple of little erbium atoms

1462
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,079
and it's not a

1463
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,920
very very few but they're they're in the

1464
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,280
glass

1465
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,000
and what happens is you take this this

1466
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,880
this loop of fiber and you add another

1467
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,920
laser to it so in edfa you use either

1468
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,880
980 or 1480 and these these are the the

1469
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,720
frequencies the reason that we use

1470
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,640
erbium is because that's the thing that

1471
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,240
does what we want

1472
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,319
in c band and there'll be some other

1473
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,400
element that'll do the exact same thing

1474
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,319
in a different frequency

1475
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,359
so the the 980 and the 1480 these are

1476
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,119
the laser powers that will come along

1477
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,200
and excite the erbium ion so you'll

1478
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,280
you'll have these electron shells

1479
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,359
that'll jump to a higher energy state

1480
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,200
because power has been put into the

1481
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,400
system

1482
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,640
and so now that you have these erbium

1483
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,040
ions in this excited state you you have

1484
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,000
your good signal come in and as it comes

1485
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,520
in and hits these erbium ions it will

1486
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,839
the the electron will decay to a lower

1487
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,920
energy state and it will emit a photon

1488
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
and it will be a clone of the signal

1489
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,599
that you put in and that's how you

1490
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,040
amplify the signal

1491
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,400
um

1492
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,720
so the reason you have 980 and 1480

1493
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,720
1480s you just have two different stages

1494
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,599
so if you you put in 1480 that's your

1495
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,119
quasi-stable state that's where your

1496
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,800
amplification is really happening and if

1497
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,880
you put in 980 it will immediately decay

1498
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,359
deport to the next level down and same

1499
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,559
same deal

1500
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,599
but it's it's that kind of mechanism and

1501
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:06,800
so if you actually look at the

1502
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,559
construction itself you you have that

1503
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,599
loop of fiber you have the the little uh

1504
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,960
filters on either end so you make sure

1505
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,200
that you you don't leak your pump laser

1506
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,280
out into the world so it will never go

1507
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,880
out either direction

1508
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,000
you inject your pump laser in and all

1509
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,760
the amplification happens inside that

1510
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,880
little spool of fiber and that's what's

1511
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,720
called a lumped amplification system

1512
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,640
so that's awesome why can't we do that

1513
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,319
forever well you have a thing called

1514
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,280
noise

1515
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,000
so in addition to

1516
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,520
amplifying the signal that you want and

1517
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,079
creating these these great photons

1518
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,640
you will inherently create what's called

1519
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,040
ase amplified spontaneous emissions

1520
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,200
which is noise that you don't want so

1521
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,440
the reason for that is once you get that

1522
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,599
erbium ion into

1523
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,280
an excited state you get this electron

1524
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,520
up you have about 10 milliseconds for a

1525
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,920
good photon to come along and hit it and

1526
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,680
if within that 10 milliseconds a good

1527
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,280
photon does not come along it will

1528
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,359
spontaneously decay and emit a bad

1529
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,559
photon the bad photon is noise that

1530
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,240
looks the same as your regular signal

1531
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,640
and will eventually make it unusable

1532
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,720
so the way that you want to think about

1533
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,280
this is the stronger the signal when you

1534
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,520
amplify it the better your amplification

1535
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,440
will be

1536
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,440
but after enough amplification passes so

1537
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,319
here here's an example of um kind of

1538
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,640
what edfa noise looks like so this this

1539
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,720
particular curve uh you see the two

1540
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,480
spikes that are the two good signals and

1541
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,200
then everything else in here is is noise

1542
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,680
that comes from the the edfa process

1543
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,800
and it's

1544
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,319
stronger in certain bands than others

1545
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,880
so like i said why why does that matter

1546
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,079
um so

1547
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,200
i don't think this is quite the right

1548
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,040
way to visualize this but i was trying

1549
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,280
to illustrate that it really really

1550
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,480
matters

1551
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,760
because if you

1552
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,079
if you take a signal and you amplify it

1553
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,880
before it gets too weak your osnr will

1554
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,839
stay

1555
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,079
beautiful it'll stay nice and clean but

1556
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,319
if you wait look the more and more you

1557
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,280
wait so as you go into you let it go to

1558
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,119
neg 10 you let it go to neg 15 you let

1559
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,920
it go to neg-20 you see this rapid drop

1560
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,119
off in osnr that you get um

1561
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,200
as you go through more edfahops because

1562
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,640
of that and so that's that's what you're

1563
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,000
designing against when you're when

1564
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,839
you're trying to make this work

1565
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,839
another kind of amplification is called

1566
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,000
raman amplification so this works

1567
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,760
through a principle called stimulated

1568
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,200
raman scattering and in certain areas

1569
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,359
that's a bad thing so that's that's

1570
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,040
what's called a nonlinear effect that we

1571
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,440
don't like in later in the talk but for

1572
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,119
right now it's using it in a good

1573
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,720
strategic way to do something that we do

1574
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,960
want so what happens here is rather than

1575
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,640
take the signal and make it brighter

1576
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,559
within this very small loop of fiber and

1577
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,799
then send it back out what we're doing

1578
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,839
is taking the the raman pump and sending

1579
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,319
it back into the line

1580
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,520
so

1581
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,119
you take a

1582
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,200
laser of a certain non-transmitting

1583
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,920
frequency you send it backwards into the

1584
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,160
line at very high powers and when your

1585
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,880
good signal comes along it transfers

1586
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,799
power so that pump laser gets weaker and

1587
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,040
your good signal gets brighter

1588
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,280
and like i said it's really it's you can

1589
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,440
do it lumped but you you shouldn't

1590
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,799
it's really used in a counter

1591
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,559
propagating way

1592
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,119
well why do you want that so let's take

1593
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,359
a look at how this works with an edf

1594
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,119
only application so there's there's two

1595
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,960
things that you don't want to do when

1596
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,559
you're transmitting you don't want to

1597
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,000
transmit too much power and you don't

1598
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,079
want to transmit too little power if you

1599
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,599
transmit too much power you get

1600
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,839
something called non-linear effects

1601
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,480
it's basically high power problems and

1602
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,280
it will rapidly degrade your signal and

1603
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,559
there's a limit to how much power you

1604
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,200
can put into fiber before it literally

1605
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,680
spits it back out and says no

1606
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,760
and then you don't want it to get too

1607
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,760
low because that's when you start to add

1608
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,760
noise and start to have an unrecoverable

1609
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,720
signal so if you look at here's my nice

1610
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,160
steady curve i transmit i've got this

1611
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,480
nice high power level and it gets lower

1612
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,760
as it goes through the fiber and then i

1613
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,960
come to a headphone i make it bright

1614
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,160
again

1615
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,160
the only way to make a span of this

1616
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,680
distance work is to go into the two

1617
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,359
zones we don't want to go into right so

1618
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,839
we we transmitted really hot and we had

1619
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,400
to amplify really weak

1620
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,880
but if you add ramen counter propagating

1621
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,359
ramen to that here's what happens you

1622
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,079
get to transmit at a much lower power so

1623
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,440
you get to stay out of your bad

1624
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,400
non-linear zones and then as you get

1625
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,079
towards the end what happens is rather

1626
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,280
than go lower that signal just slowly

1627
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,359
starts to get brighter so by the time it

1628
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,520
comes into the next amplification stage

1629
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,480
it's already much higher power signal

1630
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,559
now you can apply your edfa again and

1631
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,119
you get to apply less amplification less

1632
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,359
noise you have a stronger signal coming

1633
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,200
in you don't go into the non-linear zone

1634
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,680
again it's a tremendous gain so what

1635
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,760
does that look like well here's an

1636
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,839
example of

1637
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,119
21 db os and r 7 hops so you literally

1638
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,440
take a signal that would have only gone

1639
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,599
through seven amplification passes and

1640
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,880
turn it into 20 in the exact same system

1641
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,559
uh so that that's a tremendous gain

1642
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,839
because if you if you had to sell

1643
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,079
service and you actually had to go you

1644
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,599
would have to region that signal three

1645
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,119
times that would have been terribly

1646
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,520
expensive but here you change your

1647
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,520
amplification design and you're able to

1648
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,040
take that same signal carry it much

1649
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,040
further or even if you're not carrying

1650
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,040
it that far when it does come out it's

1651
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,040
got a higher osnr so you can get more

1652
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,520
bit out of it

1653
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,520
but when you do amplification you really

1654
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,880
have to concern yourself with power

1655
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,079
balance uh because amplifiers

1656
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,119
they

1657
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,799
the whole point of what you're doing is

1658
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,240
you have all these channels and they to

1659
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,680
some degree have to be balanced if

1660
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,240
they're not balanced what happens is the

1661
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,160
the high power channel steals all the

1662
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,680
power and the low power channel doesn't

1663
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,640
get any

1664
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,200
so it's it's actually a problem and one

1665
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,799
of the reasons that you can't just sell

1666
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,040
spectrum is if someone comes along and

1667
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,960
injects a signal a really bright signal

1668
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,799
that you don't want it'll just destroy

1669
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,280
all of your good signals

1670
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,520
so you you have to look at this so the

1671
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,680
first thing that happens inside of

1672
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,160
any amplifier is you have a gain

1673
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,559
flattening filter gff and so that's

1674
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,920
that's just a

1675
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,640
basically a little fpg that's designed

1676
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,079
when they make the outfit to kind of

1677
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,400
match the edfa profile so that it will

1678
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,559
try to flatten it out a little bit it

1679
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,160
won't be perfect but it'll it'll take a

1680
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,720
first pass at it and then after you go

1681
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,400
several hops you will inherently one

1682
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,680
signal get a little bit stronger one

1683
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,440
signal get a little bit weaker

1684
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,280
and eventually you'll have to do what's

1685
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,799
called dge dynamic gain equalization so

1686
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,799
probably the the easiest most common way

1687
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:35,920
to do this and why there's a lot of

1688
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,119
rodents out there is you run it through

1689
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,440
a rotom so the whole rodent process is

1690
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,520
effectively re-power balancing and

1691
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,160
re-shifting every channel independently

1692
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,839
so that's how you come out with a nice

1693
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,359
flat gain that's how you do your

1694
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,839
long-haul

1695
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,400
systems um amplifiers also really care

1696
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,960
about the total system power so

1697
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,799
they care both in what they can output

1698
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,480
and what they can input this is kind of

1699
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,400
one of the most fundamental things about

1700
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,880
their design and really informs

1701
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,040
everything that you do and why you do it

1702
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,000
so

1703
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,599
let's say that you you have a single

1704
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,680
channel it's coming in at zero dbm so

1705
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,520
you've got one milliwatt of power great

1706
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,520
so now you put a 40 channel mux on that

1707
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,599
you do the same thing you've now got 40

1708
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,520
milliwatts of power you've got a plus 16

1709
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,960
dbm system

1710
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,520
so if your amplifier's max power input

1711
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,400
is neg six for example uh let's say that

1712
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,839
it's a

1713
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,440
um

1714
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,079
i'll make up a theory 15 db gain

1715
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,720
amplifier that can output 21db

1716
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,720
maximum power and so

1717
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,799
each channel must come in

1718
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:37,680
or

1719
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,920
yeah no even though the whole system

1720
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,040
must come in at neg6 because

1721
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,799
it would it would blow out the amp you

1722
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,319
have too much signal so what that means

1723
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,400
is that each channel has to come in very

1724
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,920
weak so you look at that and you go okay

1725
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,960
in a 40 channel system each channel must

1726
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,480
be below negative 22 before it goes into

1727
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,960
the edge or it blows the whole thing up

1728
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,359
and so what you end up having to do is

1729
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,960
if it's not weak enough to make it

1730
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,640
weaker so that you can amplify it again

1731
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,880
which is counter-intuitive but it uh

1732
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,160
that's what you have to do to make that

1733
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,400
system work and remember this is this is

1734
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,920
a potentially dynamically changing

1735
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,000
system so you've got this the system

1736
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,359
coming along and then someone comes

1737
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,880
along and flips off power to the rack

1738
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,440
and 40 channels die and so the the power

1739
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,599
in the system completely changes and you

1740
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,920
have to react to that uh and make sure

1741
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,000
that that's that's good so the the

1742
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,240
really the the good fs will actually you

1743
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,359
have a feedback loop and they're

1744
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,799
monitoring and making sure that they're

1745
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,480
adjusting the power mode

1746
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,000
and the good the really good at first

1747
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,680
are ones that actually have an out of

1748
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,839
band communication to the edges around

1749
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,680
them they're talking to them saying what

1750
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,880
are you outputting what's the signal

1751
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,000
quality what are we doing and

1752
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,839
coordinating with each other and coming

1753
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,558
up with that design

1754
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
all right so

1755
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,920
more optical concepts uh we have a thing

1756
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,440
called forward error correction or

1757
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,839
effect

1758
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,000
so

1759
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
the way to think about fec is kind of

1760
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,799
like

1761
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,799
raid for your optics

1762
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,240
you're adding a little bit of extra

1763
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,319
redundant information so that you can

1764
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,359
computationally recover from any errors

1765
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,200
so in practice the way that that works

1766
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,559
is it lets you lower the required osnr

1767
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,119
in which you would have had a

1768
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,960
a signal that you couldn't decode and

1769
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,599
now you can and so that lets you do more

1770
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,680
with it so for example uh you can take a

1771
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,520
10.325 so that's a 10 gig that's what

1772
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,599
it's actually transmitting is 10.325

1773
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:34,000
with overhead and you pad it up to 11.

1774
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,319
so there's a 7 overhead and now you take

1775
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,000
what would have gone 80 kilometers and

1776
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,319
you can make it go 120 because you can

1777
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,119
recover from a weaker signal or one with

1778
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,280
more dispersion

1779
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,799
and where this really matters is when

1780
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,960
you've got these old systems these

1781
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,640
brownfield systems because

1782
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,280
if you want to go deploy new technology

1783
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,359
great but you probably can't move your

1784
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,520
huts you probably can't redo the way the

1785
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,720
fiber is connected you have a lot of

1786
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,720
systems that are out there that you have

1787
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,400
to work with

1788
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,160
and so effect lets you do that it lets

1789
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,440
you keep growing that and it's it's

1790
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,799
become very

1791
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,359
uh baked into almost everything that we

1792
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:10,480
do

1793
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,400
so the the first gen fact the really

1794
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,839
simple fact the fact that you find

1795
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,760
pretty much everywhere on every every

1796
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,680
box that you'll ever buy at this point

1797
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,680
uh is what's called rs fact read solomon

1798
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,079
vek uh and so that's like six percent

1799
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,400
overhead and you get 6 db of of net

1800
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,520
coding game

1801
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,799
and then there's newer generation

1802
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,559
there's effect

1803
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,720
and then the the newest stuff the the

1804
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,160
things that are happening in modern

1805
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,079
systems is what's called s defects soft

1806
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,520
decision effect

1807
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,200
and here you're adding a tremendous

1808
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,960
amount of overhead you you jump from six

1809
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,280
to seven to now we're up okay here's 25

1810
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,200
overhead well why do we do that well it

1811
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,000
turns out that extra couple of db of

1812
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,559
gain is tremendous that's that's the

1813
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,400
millions and millions of dollars of

1814
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,599
difference in transponders so it's worth

1815
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,280
putting a little bit of extra overhead

1816
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,200
into that signal and like i said it's

1817
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,039
it's really baked into at this point

1818
01:02:59,039 --> 01:02:59,920
it's

1819
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,160
firmly a part of almost every optical

1820
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,240
standard that you will find with a few

1821
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,559
exceptions so

1822
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,039
the the very original standard so if you

1823
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,960
look at like 100 gig for example one of

1824
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,720
the very first things that was

1825
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,920
standardized for 100 gig was lr4 it's a

1826
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,240
very simple and it was designed in a

1827
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,960
world before we actually knew is fact

1828
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,640
going to be available on every host

1829
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,039
board or not

1830
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,280
the downside of that is that in order

1831
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,599
for lr4 to work it has to be very

1832
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,319
tightly packed around 1310 and it makes

1833
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,000
it more expensive you have a more

1834
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,319
precise lasers you have better cooling

1835
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:40,000
you have you have a tighter tighter mux

1836
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,720
the modern version of that is you get to

1837
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,200
use a wider mux that doesn't need to be

1838
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,280
as precisely cooled and you cover it in

1839
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,119
fact and it's tremendous you know 40

1840
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,680
less than the cost of lr4

1841
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,920
so in the the vast majority of the world

1842
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,799
you look at the the shipment of optics

1843
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,680
most of the world uses things like cwdm4

1844
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,559
4wdm which is the modern evolved version

1845
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,319
uh that's that's much cheaper but for

1846
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,160
some reason the the internet side the

1847
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,920
peering the transit side is still fixed

1848
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,440
on the first thing that we heard about

1849
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,599
which is lr4 which is actually

1850
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,680
not as efficient and doesn't take this

1851
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,839
into account but almost everything else

1852
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,000
sr4 all of your 400 gig stuff all of

1853
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,079
your modern stuff all has effect very

1854
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,920
much baked in there and it's it's just a

1855
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,319
part of the standard now

1856
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:28,319
so here's kind of what this looks like

1857
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:31,920
in a graphical form so if you look at

1858
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,000
this is a bit error rate so

1859
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,400
as as it gets higher and higher it

1860
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,880
becomes you know unusable

1861
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,319
so you want your bit error rate to be

1862
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,200
very very low and over here on this blue

1863
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,319
line this is the os and r on the x axis

1864
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,319
that we needed in order to get a very

1865
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,720
low bit error rate so we needed to have

1866
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,839
a very

1867
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,480
good signal we need to have an 18 db osr

1868
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,559
signal in order to

1869
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,359
get this lowest bit error rate and with

1870
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,039
better and better and better effect what

1871
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,200
happens is it pushes that bar over so

1872
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,079
now i i was still fine i have an 8 db

1873
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,079
which is tremendous difference remember

1874
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,839
this is logarithmic there's a tremendous

1875
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,960
difference between 18 db and 8 db in

1876
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,720
terms of signal quality and i'm still

1877
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,160
able to work with it and i'm still able

1878
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,000
to to decode and transmit that signal

1879
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,319
there's another thing called otn digital

1880
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,079
wrapper technology g709 so um this is

1881
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,640
kind of the modern version of sonnet and

1882
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,000
sdh

1883
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,720
for four wavelengths and really what's

1884
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,799
happening here is you're you're kind of

1885
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:37,839
making a system that is generic you you

1886
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,280
aren't fixed to

1887
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,200
like when the the original wdm systems

1888
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,119
came out and it was for 10 gig it was

1889
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,160
for oc 192. and then when 10 gigi came

1890
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,760
along i was like oh no no no we don't

1891
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,520
support that none of our transponders do

1892
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,480
that

1893
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,720
so otn is the the fix to that so that

1894
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,039
you can you can carry the wavelengths

1895
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,039
through your system and know something

1896
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,799
about what they are you can you can even

1897
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,799
mux them up into into different things

1898
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:04,000
without being so tied to a specific

1899
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,319
technology

1900
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,400
but you'll you'll hear that run across

1901
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,960
it's it's typically more important for

1902
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,039
carriers and typically nobody cares

1903
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,039
about it at the the data center even

1904
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,039
packet kind of

1905
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:17,839
um level

1906
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:19,839
right so types of single mode fiber this

1907
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,000
is this is a nice long one uh so i

1908
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,920
already talked about how single mode is

1909
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,760
used for essentially all of your long

1910
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,520
reach fiber applications

1911
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,960
um

1912
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,960
the standards that are go into single

1913
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,280
mode so you've got your your standard um

1914
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,280
that's called

1915
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,359
g.652 and there's newer revisions so

1916
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:40,000
there's g652 b and c and d and things

1917
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,039
like that

1918
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,520
so g652d is the current the current

1919
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,119
version of that standard

1920
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,280
and that's that's your standard smf

1921
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,839
that's that's his baseline as you get uh

1922
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,200
there's a

1923
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,039
so low water peak actually got pulled

1924
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,799
into standards so if you look at like

1925
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:57,200
modern fiber it is low water peak fiber

1926
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,359
it's it's g652d

1927
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,440
and that's fiber that's designed to not

1928
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,359
not block some of those those bands that

1929
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:04,960
you might want to use

1930
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,559
then you have a thing called dispersion

1931
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,319
shifted fiber so this was fiber that was

1932
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,960
designed so that the lowest point of

1933
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,720
dispersion was moved from 1310 to 1550

1934
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,799
the hope being oh great this will will

1935
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,960
transmit with no dispersion and with

1936
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,119
with low loss it'll be fantastic and it

1937
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:22,720
turned out not to be it was a terrible

1938
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,559
idea um

1939
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,400
so then there's g654 which is the

1940
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,520
fiber that's for sub c kind of stuff

1941
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,000
uh then after they figured out that 653

1942
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,520
was a terrible idea that should never

1943
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,039
have been done they're like oh crap

1944
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:38,079
revert

1945
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,480
so they came up with non-zero dispersion

1946
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,039
shifted fiber which is similar but you

1947
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,960
don't get that point of zero so it turns

1948
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,119
out we actually like dispersion we need

1949
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,359
dispersion dispersion is important

1950
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,359
but when this was originally designed

1951
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,119
people didn't know that this was before

1952
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,160
before the invention of dwdm and really

1953
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,559
dwdm is not that old like this was

1954
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,640
deployed commercially in 1998 this is

1955
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,079
this is newish technology uh that in

1956
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,920
some areas changes radically and in

1957
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,960
other areas doesn't change at all

1958
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,960
and then you have g657 which is the

1959
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,480
standard for bend and sensitive so it's

1960
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,160
your data center patch cables that you

1961
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,920
you know people play around with and it

1962
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,960
doesn't need this perfect bend radius

1963
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,399
so your standard single mode fiber um

1964
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,880
like i said you'll hear it called smf-28

1965
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,040
it it might not actually be but that was

1966
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,158
a common problem there's there's smf-28e

1967
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:31,920
plus low loss there's all these new

1968
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,040
versions of the the same gist uh but uh

1969
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,359
it is you'll also hear it called ndsf

1970
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,040
non-dispersion shifted fiber so it's

1971
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,920
just it's g652 um and this was

1972
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,479
originally designed for that 1310 band

1973
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:45,839
um

1974
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:47,198
and it has

1975
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,439
dispersion in 1550 but the lowest

1976
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:52,158
attenuation and so ironically this the

1977
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:53,679
oldest kind of fiber has come full

1978
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,120
circle to being the kind of fiber that

1979
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,120
we actually like again

1980
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,238
so it's interesting to watch the

1981
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,799
evolution of the technology

1982
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,960
so the low water peak fiber like i said

1983
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,120
they just engineer the glass

1984
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,920
so that it removes less of that you take

1985
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,679
out some of the hydroxyl molecules and

1986
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,839
you have less attenuation in some of

1987
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,920
these bands

1988
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,640
so

1989
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,799
the dispersion shifted fiber like i said

1990
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,080
it

1991
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,960
you need dispersion it's it's

1992
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,359
the best way to describe this um when

1993
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,359
you have dispersion so you have a signal

1994
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,040
come in and you have what's called walk

1995
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,799
off so you you start to spread the

1996
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,640
signal out a little bit

1997
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,040
if you don't spread out the signal what

1998
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,640
you have is this this power entering the

1999
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,000
exact molecule at the exact time and

2000
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,719
that causes your nonlinear effects so

2001
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,880
you want a little bit of dispersion so

2002
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,960
you spread that so in any given instant

2003
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,359
that exact you know photon is not

2004
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,920
passing through that exact atom

2005
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,439
that ends up making your signal much

2006
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,520
better and it really matters for for wdm

2007
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,920
systems

2008
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,440
sorry

2009
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,360
so like i said they deployed some of

2010
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,760
this stuff out there and then realized

2011
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,920
horrible and it it hasn't been deployed

2012
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,760
in a very long time but you'll still

2013
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,199
find it in the field sometimes

2014
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,719
so non-zero what they said was all right

2015
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,960
we like the idea because this was this

2016
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,920
was designed in a time when 10 gig was

2017
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,719
was what you were trying to accomplish

2018
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,960
and dispersion was your biggest enemy so

2019
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,679
we like the idea of lower dispersion but

2020
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,000
we don't want it to be zero so we'll

2021
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,080
move the point of zero dispersion

2022
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,760
outside of the band that we want but

2023
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,920
we're we're still down you know you take

2024
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,280
you take it from

2025
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,400
17 picoseconds per nanometer down to two

2026
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,400
or five or something

2027
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,320
and this will be good and so you'll have

2028
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,679
you'll have two different slopes of

2029
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,679
fiber you'll have the transmission fiber

2030
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,440
where the signal spreads out and then

2031
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,880
you'll have the compensation fiber

2032
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,440
that's matched to this and so it

2033
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,880
actually has to be brand match like if

2034
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,880
you have corning fiber you need a spool

2035
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,400
that is designed to match

2036
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,239
exactly that corning profile so that it

2037
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,560
balances out and if you buy

2038
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,320
lucent fiber it'll be something slightly

2039
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,000
different

2040
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
but that that was the the theory so this

2041
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,920
was like i said this was very much uh

2042
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,800
early 2000s

2043
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,920
10 gig kind of signals

2044
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,040
g654 is the ultra low attenuation stuff

2045
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,280
and so what's happening here is

2046
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,159
it's actually ultra wide core so

2047
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,560
when you're doing sub subsea you

2048
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,960
you're deploying this multi-million

2049
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,800
dollar thing that you hopefully won't

2050
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,640
ever go touch it'll all be built in a

2051
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,400
clean room and engineered and rolled out

2052
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,159
and and you hope that it's going to last

2053
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,840
for a really long time and carry a whole

2054
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,440
bunch of signals and over time carry

2055
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,520
much better signals than you you ever

2056
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,400
put in so when you design for that where

2057
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,080
you can't just go send a text and swap

2058
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,280
out a card

2059
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,120
you design for

2060
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,080
high power so you you want really wide

2061
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,159
cores so you can get really high power

2062
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:55,280
so that you

2063
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,199
do less noise when you do your

2064
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,880
amplification that's that's what that

2065
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,800
exists for

2066
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,960
uh g657 like i said is the bend and

2067
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,560
sensitive fiber

2068
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,600
and there's a bunch of different

2069
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,960
standards on that

2070
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,920
but most fiber that's out there is is

2071
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,600
actually better than the spec the

2072
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,679
official spec the minimum requirement

2073
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,600
but uh if you if you really care you

2074
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,880
figure out what kind of fiber it is and

2075
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,239
you go pull the spec sheet on it and

2076
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:19,600
look it up and you can see the exact

2077
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,040
details

2078
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,960
so here's here's an example of like

2079
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,719
dispersion rates of different fiber

2080
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,679
right so um you know true wave product

2081
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:29,600
versus a leaf product versus a teralyte

2082
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,880
product

2083
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,719
and what that looks like

2084
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:33,440
but

2085
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,800
so for regular smf 17 is the kind of the

2086
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,880
middle of the band standard for

2087
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,400
dispersion that you'll you'll see

2088
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,080
all right so now i'm going to talk about

2089
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,000
non-linear impairments otherwise known

2090
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,640
as high power problems so if you don't

2091
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,480
transmit high powers you will never see

2092
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,840
these problems full stop end of

2093
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,600
statement you're good

2094
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,239
so what do i mean by high power well it

2095
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,480
depends um

2096
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,640
as a rule of thumb it really doesn't

2097
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,800
matter until you get above plus 4 dbm

2098
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,840
per lambda give or take

2099
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,239
so the nonlinear impairments um they

2100
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,080
they really they categorize as the

2101
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,480
following so you have a classification

2102
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,640
called stimulated scattering

2103
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,120
of which you have sbs and srs so

2104
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,600
stimulated pre-wand scattering

2105
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,840
and stimulated raman scattering and then

2106
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,960
you have something called the kerr

2107
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,000
effect and what's happening there is

2108
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,800
the

2109
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,880
light itself the intensity of the light

2110
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,360
is actually spontaneously momentarily

2111
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,960
changing the refractive index of the

2112
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,040
fiber and that causes things called four

2113
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,880
wave mixing self phase modulation cross

2114
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,320
phase modulation probably a whole bunch

2115
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,800
of other stuff that i would not dare to

2116
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,199
speak on so sbs is probably the first

2117
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:52,560
one that you hit and deal with

2118
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,159
and it's it's pretty cool because what's

2119
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:55,679
happening here is

2120
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,760
when you put too much power into the

2121
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,159
fiber it's literally causing an acoustic

2122
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,800
vibration at the atomic level of the

2123
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,600
glass and it happens and it sets up a

2124
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,920
frequency in such a way that it causes

2125
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,520
reflections back so it's basically the

2126
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,760
fiber is saying i can't take any more

2127
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,520
power it has to go somewhere it spits it

2128
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,440
back out where it came from

2129
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,719
and so at a certain point this can

2130
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,400
actually cause damage to the transmitter

2131
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,719
if you spit too much power back out

2132
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,560
this is this is the stuff that you run

2133
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,679
across

2134
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,080
most commonly in your well i just took a

2135
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,679
10 week signal and made it really bright

2136
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,280
and why doesn't it work well because of

2137
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,519
this

2138
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,480
and

2139
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,080
modern signals coherence signals things

2140
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,840
that kind of dither the signal out over

2141
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,760
wider blah blah blah blah

2142
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,800
it helps so it's not as big of a thing

2143
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,120
in a commercial well-designed system but

2144
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,800
it's it's very much the thing that

2145
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,360
you'll hit as you like try to just take

2146
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,040
a signal and amplify it and you haven't

2147
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,520
designed it properly

2148
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,400
so sbs also requires long fiber so if

2149
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,480
you you do something that's really bad

2150
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,080
that would cause sps but you do it over

2151
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,440
a one meter patch cable it actually

2152
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,080
doesn't matter uh but you put it over 20

2153
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,239
kilometers span and it matters and it

2154
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:05,840
starts to fall off and it really maxes

2155
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,520
out at 20 kilometers so once once you're

2156
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,960
above 20 kilometers it doesn't matter

2157
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,400
it's it's the same as though it was 20

2158
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,520
kilometers

2159
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,000
but the length of that span is is what's

2160
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,920
causing that effect to happen so you

2161
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,679
have to remember that you can sometimes

2162
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,480
get away with stuff in short distances

2163
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,400
so srs

2164
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,400
is remember i said how how raman

2165
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,679
amplification works so when you use it

2166
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,679
intentionally you get a good effect when

2167
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,440
it happens unintentionally

2168
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,120
what it does is it makes it transfer

2169
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,840
power from one wavelength to another

2170
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,960
and the tighter you pack the channels

2171
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,120
the more this occurs

2172
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,600
so if you look at for example a

2173
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,400
an 80 channel system and you have them

2174
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,600
tightly

2175
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,080
actually no

2176
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,960
tightly packing them actually makes it

2177
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,560
better which is is weird and

2178
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,199
counterintuitive but if you take a high

2179
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:58,880
channel count system and they're very

2180
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,520
spread out then it's very easy for one

2181
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,840
to transfer power to another if they're

2182
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,880
very tightly packed it's actually better

2183
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,719
so you see here kind of the maximum

2184
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,760
launch power so if you were running a

2185
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,920
50 gigahertz system and you only ran 8

2186
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,159
channels you can transmit 21 dbm per

2187
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,760
channel which you you can't do anyways

2188
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,360
because of sbs so

2189
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,280
you would never see that effect whereas

2190
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,280
if you were down into

2191
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,320
a very wide space system and you had a

2192
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,159
very high channel count you would be

2193
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,640
very limited and you know you you

2194
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,640
usually end up somewhere in that zero

2195
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,199
one kind of range as a transmit

2196
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,440
out of the gate on most systems so when

2197
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,880
you start to go below that you have to

2198
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,280
you have to take that into account

2199
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,640
so four wave mixing is what happens when

2200
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,199
the harmonics of the wavelengths

2201
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,280
interfere with each other it's cool how

2202
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,840
this works the physics is is way above

2203
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,640
me

2204
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,159
but basically

2205
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,400
you see you have your your three good

2206
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,640
signals here and what's happened is

2207
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,920
they've created harmonics they've

2208
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,000
created interference that you didn't

2209
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,120
want

2210
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,560
both in themselves and in their

2211
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,560
neighboring channels

2212
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,080
and that's

2213
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,159
very linked to

2214
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,760
if you don't have dispersion you get

2215
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,960
these effects very quickly

2216
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,120
so here's uh what's called four wave

2217
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,960
mixing efficiency which is how likely it

2218
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,280
is to happen uh so when you have um

2219
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,960
that point of zero and you have no

2220
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,719
dispersion happening on your fiber you

2221
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:29,440
see that it's very very easy to have

2222
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,280
very very thorough mixing

2223
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,199
until you have very wide channels and as

2224
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,360
soon as you add even one picosecond per

2225
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,840
nanometer you rapidly drop off that

2226
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,800
mixing efficiency but then you see 17

2227
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,640
the regular smf you see that it's

2228
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,480
dramatically reduced and you you can

2229
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,480
pack very tight and not see this impact

2230
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,239
so here's an example of what that looks

2231
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,719
like so if you had a

2232
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:58,000
a 32 channel system

2233
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
tightly packed you see the the different

2234
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,280
limitations

2235
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,800
some of which can get can get very

2236
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,320
severe right you know if you can't

2237
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,760
transmit above an egg 5 or an x6 that's

2238
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,040
that's probably going to be a problem in

2239
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,040
your engineering

2240
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,000
um the inner channel affects xpm and spm

2241
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,400
uh so cross-phase modulation is what

2242
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,840
happens um

2243
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,840
when one wavelength of light affects the

2244
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,640
phase of another so it

2245
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,640
doesn't bother

2246
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,560
so i'll talk about i probably should

2247
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,920
reorder this so i talked about phase

2248
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,880
earlier but um in an nrz system so a

2249
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,880
very classic brighter dem brighter dim

2250
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,800
we don't care about phase it doesn't

2251
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,280
really care but what happens when you

2252
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,239
take a old 10 gig energy system and you

2253
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:41,679
put it on the same line system as a

2254
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:43,920
modern coherence system is that 10 gig

2255
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,000
signal can cross cost cross phase

2256
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,239
modulation in your coherent signal which

2257
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:49,840
does care about phase and so that's

2258
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,239
that's why they tell you don't mix old

2259
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,239
and new or if you do keep them separated

2260
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,400
with a guard band specifically for this

2261
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,239
reason

2262
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,080
and once again high chromatic dispersion

2263
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,640
uh dispersion actually helps helps this

2264
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,280
issue and then spm self-phase modulation

2265
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,920
is is what happens when the the

2266
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,600
difference between a zero and a one is

2267
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,040
so strong that it triggers the curve

2268
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,520
effect and it's uh weird exotic physics

2269
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,280
but if you ever hear the term

2270
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,760
there it is um so

2271
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,760
remember when i was talking about sub c

2272
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,280
cables and why they were designed for

2273
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,440
these very wide cores so if you think

2274
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,440
about non-linear effects this is really

2275
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,080
an energy density problem it's it's what

2276
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,600
happens when you put too much power in

2277
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,400
one place at one exact instant

2278
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,080
and so ways that you can spread that out

2279
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,080
well one you can spread out the signal

2280
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:39,360
uh two you can spread it out over time

2281
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,640
or three you can spread it out over

2282
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,400
space you can make the core bigger and

2283
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,480
so you spread the power out so what you

2284
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,960
do is you you get it as close to when

2285
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,960
you can't go out of single mode you

2286
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,960
can't cross into multi-mode but you can

2287
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,440
engineer it to have as wide of what's

2288
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,280
called an effective area

2289
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,960
so if you ever want to know what this is

2290
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,239
you can go look it up on your fiber

2291
01:19:58,239 --> 01:19:59,920
specs and you'll see it listed as the

2292
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,480
mfd the mode field diameter and then you

2293
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,640
can just pi r squared it or it'll it'll

2294
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,280
be listed as effective area

2295
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,600
the larger the effective area the lower

2296
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,239
the non-linear effects uh so for example

2297
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:16,000
your your kind of um nz dsf standard is

2298
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,040
like 50 50 microns squared effective

2299
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,159
area leaf which stands for

2300
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,719
low effect or large effective area fiber

2301
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,480
is designed to be a little bit wider

2302
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,480
then you look at your standard smf you

2303
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,000
get all the way up to 80 and then you

2304
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,920
look at your submarine fiber so for

2305
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,320
example corning bascade is a product you

2306
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,920
get up into 150 microns squared

2307
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,000
so remember one trade-off here is that

2308
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,760
the larger the effective area the less

2309
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,760
the raman game because ramen is a kind

2310
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,159
of nonlinear effect so you trade this

2311
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:48,639
off if you have if you have

2312
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:51,600
classic 652 then you get to put more

2313
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,199
power into the system but you get less

2314
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,440
ramen gain if you have a dispersion

2315
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,360
shifted fiber you can put less power in

2316
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,800
but you get more raman gain so they

2317
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,960
balance each other out pretty well

2318
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,480
but you have to take that into account

2319
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,880
in your designs

2320
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,760
so

2321
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,360
let me talk about what we actually

2322
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,760
transmit over fiber so remember at the

2323
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,280
end of the day we actually live in an

2324
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,040
analog world all these nice ones and

2325
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,560
zeros have to turn into something that

2326
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,400
goes out over waves somewhere

2327
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,400
and light is just a big electromagnetic

2328
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,719
wave um so the simplest form of

2329
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,280
modulation is what's called imdd stands

2330
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,960
for intensity modulation with direct

2331
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,719
detection of which the most common

2332
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:28,239
version is something called nrz

2333
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:30,560
non-return to zero which is also called

2334
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,880
amplitude shift keying ask

2335
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,400
all of which is a fancy way to say

2336
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,920
bright for a one and dem for a zero

2337
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:36,880
right

2338
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,440
and that's that's what most systems have

2339
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,199
been historically and that's what

2340
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,280
everything up into 10 gig absolutely is

2341
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,400
up into 40 gig and even into most

2342
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,719
hundred gig that's out there as client

2343
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,199
optics as you move into

2344
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,800
newer 100 gig

2345
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,400
it's called single lambda 100 gig as you

2346
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,800
move into 400 gig as you move into pam4

2347
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,719
as you move into other things

2348
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:00,719
then we've started to to shift away from

2349
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,360
nrz into more complicated things

2350
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,520
but historically this is this is what's

2351
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,880
out there so i talked about

2352
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,480
a little bit of background so baud bot

2353
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,239
is what happens when you modulate the

2354
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,000
signal you go from a one to a zero and

2355
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,080
in doing so you get to say you go from

2356
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,360
right to a dim and in doing so you get

2357
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,400
to say that was a one and that was a

2358
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,600
zero and baud is the number of changes

2359
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,120
per second so if i plug in a 10 gig

2360
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,520
you know lr uh what's happening is that

2361
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,760
thing is flashing brighter than them 10

2362
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,760
billion times a second and i'm decoding

2363
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,920
that on the other end and you get one

2364
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,920
bit per bond so every bright one every

2365
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,960
dem zero and you you see that happen

2366
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,440
uh so that works really well up into a

2367
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,159
point um so like i said we historically

2368
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,320
built a lot of great things until we hit

2369
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,800
that like 10 gig barrier

2370
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,600
and we didn't overcome that until uh

2371
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,280
until we created see you don't have that

2372
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,120
in the next slide um i'll talk about

2373
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,239
that so

2374
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:57,760
uh so where do we go from there right

2375
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,520
once once you start this he's hit these

2376
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,280
limitations how do we keep up with our

2377
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,920
cat pictures and russian trolls

2378
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,000
well what you do is you start to

2379
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,440
increase the amount of information that

2380
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,760
you can encode in a single symbol change

2381
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,080
and a single ball change so the there's

2382
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,360
two ways to do that so if you're if

2383
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,840
you're still in ask amplitude shift

2384
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,040
keying or amplitude modulation am radio

2385
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,239
what you do is you have more than two

2386
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,679
states so instead of a bright and a dem

2387
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:22,880
you have a brightness really bright and

2388
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,639
dim and are really dim

2389
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,719
and the other thing you can do is do

2390
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:28,320
phase modulation

2391
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,719
so phage phase modulation

2392
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,120
so you've got your analog signal a nice

2393
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,520
sine wave and what you do is

2394
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,520
both your sender and your receiver agree

2395
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,520
on a specific frequency so let's say i'm

2396
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,080
going to be

2397
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,080
192.100 terahertz and i agree i'm the

2398
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,320
same thing the receiver actually has a

2399
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,080
laser on its receive side and it dials

2400
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,840
to exactly the same setting as the other

2401
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,600
one so these these two things are in

2402
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,520
sync they've got the same sine wave same

2403
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,800
frequency

2404
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,120
and so now the transmitter can just

2405
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,440
modulate the phase it can it can

2406
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,080
change where that sine wave is and in

2407
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,239
doing so the receiver can detect that

2408
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:10,000
and decode it and get information

2409
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,639
so that's coherent technology is really

2410
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:15,679
when you start to move into using phase

2411
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:18,239
phase shift keying as a part of of this

2412
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,639
so coherent is is really a

2413
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,600
marketing term esque that covers a whole

2414
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,239
bunch of stuff so uh it introduces phase

2415
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,080
shift king

2416
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,320
it's named after a so there's a concept

2417
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,080
in physics called phase coherence that's

2418
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,760
what it's it's named for but it's the

2419
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,159
ability to track phase changes uh in

2420
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:39,280
optical um and it's what lets you go you

2421
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,760
know in the early 2000s from that nrz 10

2422
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,199
gig into into this new new world um like

2423
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:46,719
i said it has a local oscillator you

2424
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:49,199
dial the local oscillator to match the

2425
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:50,560
it's reference laser and it's comparing

2426
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,639
the two

2427
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,159
but you have to tie all that together so

2428
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:55,840
it actually requires a lot of really

2429
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,679
complex dsps

2430
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:59,760
so you have a

2431
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,679
digital signal processor it's basically

2432
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,080
a little asic that's specifically

2433
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,800
designed for processing analog signals

2434
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,000
and a lot of these things are really

2435
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,520
complex they're they're getting up there

2436
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,000
they're approaching like cpu level of

2437
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,920
complexity there's there's

2438
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,600
billions of transistors there's lots of

2439
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,120
engineering there's lots of science that

2440
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,679
goes into it um the dsp is what is

2441
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,280
letting you take all of this stuff and

2442
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,360
and kind of cram it together uh but

2443
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:27,120
coherent technology also introduced um

2444
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,159
let's have a slide for that

2445
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,679
i'll probably have it coming up um

2446
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:34,880
so like i said you need that you need

2447
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,159
that dsp to to do phase modulation and

2448
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,719
to tie the stuff together uh

2449
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,360
the dsp is very expensive very big very

2450
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,440
power hungry all of that stuff but

2451
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,360
coherent is what took us from we have

2452
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,440
this hard limit of like 1.6 terabit

2453
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,000
because we had 160 10 gig channels and

2454
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,960
it immediately turned it into here's 9

2455
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,639
600 gig channels

2456
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,840
and has gone up 200 400 600 800 and

2457
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,159
continues to increase

2458
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,639
um and it delivered true 100 gig optical

2459
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:07,199
signals not just a bunch of n by 10s

2460
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:10,159
um so then where do you go from there

2461
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,360
how do we how do we keep delivering

2462
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,600
these cat videos well uh after phase

2463
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,280
shift keying then you go to the

2464
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,080
combination of both phase shift and

2465
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,840
amplitude modulation and that's called

2466
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,120
qualm uh so

2467
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,040
you increase there's there's varying

2468
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,719
levels and so we've now moved into a

2469
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,000
world where there's these um

2470
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,960
non-perfectly mapped qualms there's

2471
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,120
dynamically tunable qualms there's uh

2472
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,800
thing constellations that adapt to

2473
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,320
conditions of the fiber there's all

2474
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,800
manner of complexity uh but you're

2475
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,960
so you don't have a slide on that uh no

2476
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,679
i need to isolate on that but you you

2477
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:46,159
computationally increase the complexity

2478
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,239
of how many bits per body you can get

2479
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,480
through more and more complex things all

2480
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,760
of which requires better and better

2481
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,679
conditions on your on your align system

2482
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:55,600
and so the way it works it goes into

2483
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,639
eight quantum 16 comm 32 64. um so right

2484
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:01,440
now 64 qualm is pretty much the limit of

2485
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,600
anything practical

2486
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,120
and it works great for metro and it

2487
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,639
works great for

2488
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,480
even like you know hundreds of

2489
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,080
kilometers and thousands if you do it

2490
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,320
right uh but not not very very long-haul

2491
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,920
systems and then very long-haul stuff

2492
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,280
really tends to be

2493
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,880
16 qualmer or less

2494
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,320
so the other thing that coherent

2495
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,320
technology added was polarization

2496
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,880
multiplexing so remember light is just

2497
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,639
this electromagnetic wave through space

2498
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,639
and you can have a vertical and you can

2499
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:30,320
have a horizontal and the two can

2500
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,080
co-propagate and not interfere with each

2501
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,320
other and so what you can do is oh yeah

2502
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,239
that just effectively gave me two fibers

2503
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,320
so i will split my signal and i'll send

2504
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,440
uh one and one uh polarization one in

2505
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,360
the other but you need that dsp to tie

2506
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,040
all that together and sort it out it's

2507
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,320
something that you wouldn't otherwise be

2508
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,639
able to do with a kind of a photo diode

2509
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,520
bright dem kind of sensor

2510
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,239
so how does that all work

2511
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,480
really the way to think about it is the

2512
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,600
rate that you get out of your

2513
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,199
transponder is a combination of

2514
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,840
polarization times baud times modulation

2515
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:05,760
so polarization right now there's two

2516
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,000
there's people talking about spin

2517
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,760
polarization and weird things it's not

2518
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,719
practical i'm not going to happen

2519
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,880
anytime soon so right now we have we

2520
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,480
have two polarizations

2521
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,440
um

2522
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,639
you have baud rate uh so as your baud

2523
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,560
rate increases one thing you have to

2524
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,840
remember is and it's the the ratio is

2525
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,800
very close so if you have a

2526
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,960
50 if you have a 45 gigabyte signal you

2527
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,280
need a 50 gigahertz pass band something

2528
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,800
it's very close

2529
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,280
so as the baud rate goes up the size of

2530
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,960
the channel the literal width of the

2531
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,880
channel needs to go up you need better

2532
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,120
and more sophisticated dax

2533
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,760
and then the modulation is the technique

2534
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,080
that you apply to get more bits

2535
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,679
per baud

2536
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,840
and then as the modulation gets more

2537
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,639
complex you need a better quality osnr

2538
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:56,320
because if you have lower you can't

2539
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,000
decode what the what the signal was

2540
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,280
intended to be

2541
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,239
so here's an example of very basic stuff

2542
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,159
that is still absolutely out there all

2543
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,639
over the place all over the world 100

2544
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:07,760
gig

2545
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,360
in what's called dpqpsk so

2546
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,360
you go buy a 100 gig lambda and it's not

2547
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,360
like a new modern system that's probably

2548
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,719
running this

2549
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:21,280
and what this is is a 32 gigabyte system

2550
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,920
with qpsk which is getting you two bits

2551
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,679
per hertz uh and it requires a 37.5

2552
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,199
gigahertz system so that's that's the

2553
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:30,800
stuff that is just there's tons and tons

2554
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,080
and tons of it that'll be out in the

2555
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,400
wild for a very long time and it will

2556
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,880
run down to an os and rf10 which is re

2557
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,719
and this is this is old by the way so

2558
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:41,120
modern dsps probably just knock a few db

2559
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,920
off of all these numbers um it they'll

2560
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,639
run that'll run across the planet and

2561
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:48,880
and still come out just fine uh and then

2562
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,960
as you want to do more and more stuff

2563
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,159
okay i want to how do i get to 200 well

2564
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,159
what i do is i move to

2565
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:59,679
uh well i have a choice i can move to

2566
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:04,080
16 quaam in 32 gigabyte or i can move to

2567
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,040
56 gigabyte in eight quant and they both

2568
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,040
give me the same

2569
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,679
amount of bandwidth one takes a wider

2570
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,960
channel the other requires a higher

2571
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,679
os and r so you have to strike a balance

2572
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,440
and the way the modern systems work is

2573
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,600
they actually give you complete choice

2574
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,600
you have this this giant matrix of of

2575
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,080
what you want and it will okay what can

2576
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,600
i do with the channel conditions that i

2577
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,840
have oh okay i can run this thing at 250

2578
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,800
gigs uh it's very very flexible

2579
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,560
in fact i think i i have a slide from

2580
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,280
that yeah so this is an example of a

2581
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,080
very popular uh acacia ac 1200 so this

2582
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,480
is the the dsp that's found and a whole

2583
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,920
ton of products that are out there and

2584
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,000
you can see the big matrix of what you

2585
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,920
what you want to do so you could say oh

2586
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,960
my line conditions support me using a

2587
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,080
48 gigabyte signal but not wider and so

2588
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,960
i can do x with it

2589
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,800
it's it's nice that you get that level

2590
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,239
of flexibility you're not

2591
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,000
baked into your engineering designs when

2592
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,360
you started

2593
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,600
um uh i guess i had this slide on the

2594
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,760
exact same thing um

2595
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,360
so yeah like i said remember the the

2596
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,280
channel size is increasing

2597
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,280
proportionally as the the baud rate goes

2598
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,120
up uh so that actually that actually

2599
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,040
matters for a lot of stuff uh so for

2600
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,239
example uh a new thing that's coming up

2601
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:22,880
that everyone's gonna want is 400 gig zr

2602
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,320
right there's there's a talk about it

2603
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,199
after uh cheap beautiful plugs right

2604
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:28,880
into your router it looks great some

2605
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,480
things people don't know about 400 gigs

2606
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,159
er it's a 59 gigabyte signal it needs a

2607
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,320
very wide passband mux your brownfield

2608
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,920
muxes will not do it period full stop uh

2609
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,199
you need amplification you need all

2610
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:42,960
kinds of other stuff too but

2611
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,360
it is becoming more and more the

2612
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,639
direction that things are going that

2613
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:49,040
we're doing these higher gigabot signals

2614
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,719
and you need new muxes to accommodate

2615
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,719
that

2616
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:53,600
so

2617
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,600
coherent other big advantages of

2618
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,040
coherent

2619
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,960
it eliminates the need for dispersion

2620
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,719
compensation completely it will

2621
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,000
literally eat

2622
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,800
200 000 picoseconds per nanometer and

2623
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,280
and not care or more um and in fact it

2624
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,520
actually works better with with uh

2625
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,920
coherent uh with chromatic dispersion uh

2626
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,120
because

2627
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,639
the other cool thing is it lets you lock

2628
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,320
onto a specific frequency so remember

2629
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,080
when i talked about contentionless

2630
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,400
rotom's colorless rotoms um what you

2631
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,080
could do

2632
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,679
you have a splitter you have like a 32

2633
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:24,880
way splitter and you just plug in a

2634
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,480
bunch of transponders and so now i log

2635
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,840
into my router and i say make this

2636
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:28,960
channel one

2637
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,800
and i never needed to re-cable something

2638
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,360
i i can i have that level of flexibility

2639
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,080
because i can exclude through software

2640
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,520
all the other channels that i don't want

2641
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,639
to hear about

2642
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:40,639
but the big downsides of coherent are

2643
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:43,040
that it's uh very expensive and very

2644
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,600
power hungry like i said it's um

2645
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,360
very very complex engineering that goes

2646
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,159
into these things uh and the the big

2647
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:51,679
problem especially as you talk about how

2648
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,920
do i get this into my router is it's big

2649
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,679
and power hungry and generates a lot of

2650
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,600
heat and all of that stuff

2651
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,600
historically has been been impossible to

2652
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,679
integrate into plugables until

2653
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,120
coming up

2654
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,159
so

2655
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:06,800
another thing i said there's other ways

2656
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,800
that we can increase the the

2657
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,639
density

2658
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:13,280
what you can do if you stay in amplitude

2659
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:17,120
modulation is go from so nrz is another

2660
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,280
way to describe it is pam2 there's two

2661
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,800
is pulse amplitude modulation and

2662
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,880
there's two states so right

2663
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,320
dem one zero

2664
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,600
um

2665
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,600
and this is the the eye pattern of what

2666
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,360
that looks like as the as the thing

2667
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:32,080
crosses and how you're able to detect

2668
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,120
uh so

2669
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,400
what you can do is move into something

2670
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,120
called pam4 so you you add four states

2671
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,840
and then as you cross from you you

2672
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,239
encode two bits per symbol change and so

2673
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:43,840
you you walk away these are these are

2674
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,679
the states and what that would map to um

2675
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:49,600
so the the

2676
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,719
i think probably have a slide on that

2677
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:54,400
later so um some more on 400 gigs er so

2678
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,960
this was an attempt to get 400 or get

2679
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,280
coherent into a plugable and

2680
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,520
the weird thing about this is normally

2681
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,600
the optical industry and the switching

2682
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,639
industry don't align the technology

2683
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,920
progresses at different rates um and you

2684
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,719
do

2685
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:12,880
you'll have a new optic technology

2686
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,960
before the switching technology is ready

2687
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,840
or vice versa

2688
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,960
and um

2689
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,760
if you design a switch that is the most

2690
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,239
usable in the most places it's probably

2691
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,960
not designed for a coherent optic now

2692
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,800
you you could engineer it for a coherent

2693
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,159
optic but typically when you do you

2694
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:32,560
create a very small product set that

2695
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,719
most people don't want

2696
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,960
uh how are you on time

2697
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,080
all right um

2698
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,159
okay so 400 gigs er is actually

2699
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:44,400
beautiful because it's one of those rare

2700
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:48,400
alignments of of the the industry

2701
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,199
and it's nice because the cost of the

2702
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:54,239
cost of coherent is a lot of it is

2703
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:57,520
related to scale so once you do that dsp

2704
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,040
design it doesn't cost you that much to

2705
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,199
keep producing it so once you've got

2706
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,119
enough volume going

2707
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:04,880
that's when it that's when it

2708
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,600
it really matters

2709
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:10,480
all right do we want to do questions or

2710
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:14,159
do we want to do a bunch of

2711
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,159
unless anyone has questions but i'll

2712
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:23,920
i'll do this quick so

2713
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,840
pam4 is the underpinning of a lot of new

2714
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,400
stuff that we're out so uh all of your

2715
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,400
like i said all of your 400 gig stuff

2716
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,639
all of your 100 gig single lambda stuff

2717
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:38,000
um and there's a thing called pam4 dwdm

2718
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,920
and so what they did here is they they

2719
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:44,159
took uh two 28 gigabyte signals pam4

2720
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:46,639
encoded so there's two 56 gig signals

2721
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:49,520
and they cram them into a single thing

2722
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,440
uh and so now you can deploy a custom

2723
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,760
p28 that is tuned

2724
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,119
that's not coherent that you can deploy

2725
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:56,639
100 gig at a time

2726
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,239
and do these these metroid distances

2727
01:35:58,239 --> 01:35:59,040
with

2728
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,880
but big caveats you need these wide

2729
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,480
passband boxes you need precise

2730
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,239
dispersion compensation

2731
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,800
you have to amplify

2732
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,560
10db

2733
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,239
just to make things talk to each other

2734
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:11,920
like without even going across span very

2735
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,360
high os and our requirements and you'll

2736
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,520
never get this thing through a rodent uh

2737
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,199
but so there's there's probably not a

2738
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:18,960
long shelf life on that technology but

2739
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,520
it's uh for for a few years it's a good

2740
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,679
cheap way to deploy this uh this this

2741
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:24,960
kind of thing

2742
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,960
and then we're really seeing 400 gigs of

2743
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,760
dr because of the volume uh it's it's

2744
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,520
now getting to a price point that it's

2745
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,960
uh it's it's highly highly uh advantaged

2746
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,119
okay so now i have a whole bunch of

2747
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:39,520
slides on how you do actual optical

2748
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,800
engineering

2749
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,000
so

2750
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,600
insertion loss remember even the best

2751
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,600
splices are not perfect so every time

2752
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,040
you connect two fibers together you're

2753
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,040
going to get loss of some kind

2754
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,280
so nice budgetary figure that people use

2755
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,719
for back of the envelope is like you'll

2756
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:54,639
get 0.5 db just every time you do

2757
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:55,840
anything

2758
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,159
but depends on if you've done a fusion

2759
01:36:58,159 --> 01:36:59,679
splice if you've got a patch if it's a

2760
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:01,199
clean patch if equinix plugged it in

2761
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:02,400
wrong

2762
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,800
all that fun stuff

2763
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,560
so insertion loss is also used to

2764
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,960
describe the loss that you get anywhere

2765
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,719
so if you go through a mux and you come

2766
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:12,800
out three db less it's the penalties you

2767
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,719
get just for plugging the fiber in uh we

2768
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,719
call that the insertion loss uh so some

2769
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,320
real life examples um a common 40

2770
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,360
channel aawg insertion loss will be like

2771
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,320
3.5 db worst case uh and then an 80

2772
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,560
channel will be 9.5 and you will wonder

2773
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,040
why is that well that 80 channel box is

2774
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,800
actually 240 channel muxes in an

2775
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,239
interleaver and that's how you got that

2776
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:35,840
number

2777
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,320
you'll also see bad things if you have

2778
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:41,679
mismatched cores so the fiber sizes

2779
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:44,000
don't match if you have misaligned cores

2780
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,440
if you have an air gap between the

2781
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,119
fibers if you don't hear a click when

2782
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,760
you put that optic without that plug in

2783
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,520
which happens pretty much everywhere

2784
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,440
when you want to

2785
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,440
do budgetary planning you have to look

2786
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,440
at this and say well what's what's going

2787
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,119
to happen over time right what's what's

2788
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,040
my fiber loss what's my splice loss what

2789
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,880
happens when somebody goes out and

2790
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,480
rustles in the cable tray and bends the

2791
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,159
fiber a little bit

2792
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,000
what happens in five years when the

2793
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,080
optic isn't uh isn't as brand new and

2794
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,719
shiny and isn't this hot

2795
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:17,280
when an optic says 10 kilometers this is

2796
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,000
a guideline only and sometimes it can be

2797
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,560
wildly inaccurate i i have i have

2798
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,239
literally thousands of optics that are

2799
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,239
rated for 500 meters that i can put on a

2800
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:29,199
25 kilometer span just fine

2801
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,800
whereas sometimes you'll you'll see

2802
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,400
something that's rated for 10 kilometers

2803
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,159
and you will not get 10 kilometers out

2804
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:35,040
of it

2805
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:36,800
you really have to do your actual

2806
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,159
calculations and think about this

2807
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:40,559
yourself

2808
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,480
the polish connector so uh when you look

2809
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,480
at something that says lc and then it'll

2810
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,400
have a slash

2811
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,800
pc upc apc something like that what

2812
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,639
that's telling you is the polish of the

2813
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:54,800
connector the the end face

2814
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,920
uh so pc and upc

2815
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,520
which actually stands for physical

2816
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,119
contact not polish connector which

2817
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:03,920
everyone thinks it does

2818
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,639
upc is just designed to have very low

2819
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:07,920
reflections

2820
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,080
and then you have something called apc

2821
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,719
angled physical contact that is designed

2822
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:14,800
for even lower reflection so why do you

2823
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,880
care about that uh well basically what's

2824
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,119
happening is the in face is at an angle

2825
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,960
that's that's ever so slightly off so

2826
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,199
that when you unplug the cable and in a

2827
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:24,719
normal system what happens when you have

2828
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:26,800
an open end and you unplug that cable

2829
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,320
the power has to go somewhere it just

2830
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,840
goes right back

2831
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,600
and that can be bad for for what you're

2832
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,320
doing so in an apc because there's an

2833
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,679
angle and because you don't have the

2834
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:36,960
critical angle for the light to be

2835
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,520
reflected back it just goes out into the

2836
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,040
into the cladding

2837
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,760
but so apc's always have these green

2838
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,719
ends if you mismatch if you plug an apc

2839
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:48,480
and a upc together they will kind of

2840
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,320
sort of work until they don't and a lot

2841
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:51,840
of people won't oh what's this green

2842
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,199
cable i don't know

2843
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:55,280
uh because you don't have an exact

2844
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:59,759
mating and all of that fun stuff um

2845
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,560
re-amplifying reshaping and retiming so

2846
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,040
uh signal regeneration uh with repeaters

2847
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,520
so there's this is described as the

2848
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,440
three r's uh one r two r and three r so

2849
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,440
one r is re-amplifying so you go through

2850
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,920
an f you make the signal brighter um

2851
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:17,600
great 100 optical uh two is reshaping so

2852
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,960
you're actually looking at this thing

2853
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:21,760
and you're trying to restore some of the

2854
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,119
original pulse shape but you're not

2855
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:24,800
decoding it you're not like nothing

2856
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,520
nothing fancy is happening um you're

2857
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,119
you're just

2858
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:30,800
trying to make the pulse look a little

2859
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:33,280
cleaner and then three is re-timing so

2860
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,040
this is this is effectively an oe this

2861
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,800
is you literally decode the whole thing

2862
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,159
back into electrical and then turn it

2863
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:40,080
back into optical again and restore it

2864
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,760
as a perfectly timed perfectly shaped

2865
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,159
new signal

2866
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:46,320
i talked about bit error rates earlier

2867
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,119
so

2868
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,360
in optical things don't go from good to

2869
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,760
bad they they get progressively worse

2870
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,880
and worse and worse and in a in a basic

2871
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,320
system what'll happen is like you'll

2872
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,159
just start having errors and they'll

2873
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:00,000
start leading to packet loss and you

2874
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,840
like might not notice for a little bit

2875
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,400
until customer gets angry

2876
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,239
in a modern system with fec what happens

2877
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:08,320
is you can look at the prefect bit error

2878
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,560
you can actually say before i i fixed it

2879
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,800
computationally what was my bit error

2880
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,480
rate

2881
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,320
and you can start to see that this is

2882
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,600
going to get bad soon we should do

2883
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,679
something about it

2884
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,119
but when you when you test the circuit

2885
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:22,239
when you turn up a new circuit and you

2886
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:24,239
say well i want to know with x amount of

2887
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:26,880
confidence that this thing is clean well

2888
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,119
if you want to know for example you want

2889
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:33,119
to guarantee that a 100 gig link is

2890
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:35,040
cleaned to 10 to the negative 13 bit

2891
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,360
error rate you have to transmit at line

2892
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,199
rate for three and a half hours this

2893
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:42,639
math uh so sometimes especially for for

2894
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:45,199
lower speed signals uh when field techs

2895
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:46,320
would come out and set up their test

2896
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,520
gear and leave it running for days and

2897
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,280
customers will wonder why it's because

2898
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,880
you actually need to leave it running

2899
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,440
for a very long time to to guarantee

2900
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,119
that your your bit error rate is that

2901
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:56,719
low

2902
01:41:56,719 --> 01:41:59,600
and then here's an example of how osnr

2903
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,520
affects different bit error bit error

2904
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,199
rates uh kind of talked about in an

2905
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:04,480
earlier slide

2906
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,320
tools of the trade optical power meters

2907
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,800
um so light meter is literally just a

2908
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,960
thing that's a photodiode with a output

2909
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,119
and it says how bright the signal is

2910
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:15,280
but most light meters come with a

2911
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,040
relative mode and you'll frequently see

2912
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,080
this as db versus dbm so db

2913
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,080
is expecting a known transmitter on the

2914
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,600
other side and you're measuring the loss

2915
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,000
of the cable dbm is looking at it and

2916
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,440
saying you're putting

2917
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,520
four milliwatts of power into me right

2918
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,520
now uh and so you have to make sure you

2919
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,119
are in the correct setting and that's

2920
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:34,960
pretty much the cause of

2921
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,760
almost every data center error when you

2922
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,360
see in the field tech out to go meter a

2923
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,880
thing and it comes back wrong because

2924
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,040
they're in the wrong mode and

2925
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,880
yeah i get told that they measured plus

2926
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,800
70 on my fiber all the time which good

2927
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,719
luck with that

2928
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:52,320
otdr so an otdr is a optical time domain

2929
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,159
reflectometer so what's happening here

2930
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:56,639
is you send out a pulse of light and you

2931
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,000
look further reflection it's not a

2932
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,320
really bright pulse in in short bursts

2933
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,480
and through looking at how it comes back

2934
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,639
to you can characterize where the

2935
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:06,719
splices are where the loss is you can

2936
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:08,880
you can do a whole bunch of nice things

2937
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,880
and this used to be big expensive you

2938
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,360
know ten thousand dollar things and now

2939
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,960
you can get a thing the size of a pocket

2940
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,719
calculator that'll do a 60 kilometer

2941
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:18,400
span that costs like 500 bucks they're

2942
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,360
great

2943
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,320
they're

2944
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,840
great in data centers because you can

2945
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,159
figure out is the problem in my cabinet

2946
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:25,920
is it in there like

2947
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,639
is it in zeo is it an equinix uh it

2948
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:31,040
makes life way easier

2949
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,199
so here's an example of an otdr output

2950
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:35,280
and what it looks like so you see

2951
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,440
the loss and then you see

2952
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,600
the places where there's events

2953
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,880
um

2954
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,880
and so actually this is an example where

2955
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,719
you you see where it should be a nice

2956
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,400
steady loss and then you see it go up

2957
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,679
and then come back down that's what's

2958
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:49,040
called a grower

2959
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,119
so this was an example of a mismatched

2960
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:53,199
core type uh so

2961
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:55,199
this was like above net from 20 years

2962
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:57,920
ago so probably why but um

2963
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,600
that's an example of what you'll see on

2964
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,679
a tdr but basically you can see okay

2965
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:03,760
there's a splice 2.3 kilometers away

2966
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,280
there's a splice six kilometers a splice

2967
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,360
10 kilometers and then you can see what

2968
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,600
the rate of loss is at each point and

2969
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,199
you can figure out hey there's an open

2970
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:13,440
cut there we need to go out there to

2971
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,760
look for it

2972
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,840
so question people ask all the time can

2973
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,520
i really blind myself by looking into

2974
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,119
the fiber or

2975
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:22,719
beware big scary lasers do not look into

2976
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:24,880
being with remaining eye which i printed

2977
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:25,920
out a whole bunch of these and stuck

2978
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,440
them on patch panels all over the world

2979
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,080
and it freaks text out it's great

2980
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,560
so laser safety guidelines

2981
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,199
lasers are classified into four groups

2982
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:37,199
uh so class one two three and four so

2983
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:39,360
class one is something that is either

2984
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,440
completely harmless either by physics or

2985
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,600
by like you can't possibly look at it so

2986
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,719
for example

2987
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:47,119
uh your dvd player has a big powerful

2988
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:48,639
laser but it's inside a big metal box

2989
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:51,199
that you can't look at uh or you know

2990
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:52,960
you look at a laser pointer you look at

2991
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,679
a regular optic and says class one uh it

2992
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:58,159
won't hurt you uh class one m is

2993
01:44:58,159 --> 01:44:59,840
something that is harmless as long as

2994
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,360
you don't look at it in a microscope

2995
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,119
class 2 is something that is only

2996
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:05,119
harmful if you intentionally stare at it

2997
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:07,360
so if you don't want to blind yourself

2998
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,719
you go ah that's bright and you look

2999
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:09,920
away but if you do want to blind

3000
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,679
yourself you can go look ma and then

3001
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,199
you'll hurt yourself

3002
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,960
class 3 is something that should never

3003
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,719
be viewed directly

3004
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:18,320
so there's an old american system

3005
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,320
there's a new international standard

3006
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,159
so

3007
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:25,679
it also breaks down into 3r 3b

3008
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:26,480
and

3009
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,239
what's funny is

3010
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:31,840
the exact limit depends on the frequency

3011
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,440
there's there's a very complex table

3012
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,480
that you have to look at to figure out

3013
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,480
what you're allowed to do

3014
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:39,040
and then as you as you add these things

3015
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,360
uh you you move into requirements like

3016
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,119
this needs an active safety disconnect

3017
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:44,960
so if it detects a cut in the fiber it

3018
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,520
will automatically throttle down if it

3019
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,040
you need a key to activate it things

3020
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,800
like that that are required by law and

3021
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,239
then class 4 is something that like

3022
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:55,600
burns melts or destroys alderaan

3023
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,159
so laser safety in the eye

3024
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:00,000
remember you're talking about different

3025
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,280
frequencies so we actually look at uh

3026
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,719
different effects on the body so ira

3027
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:08,320
which is called near-infrared as your

3028
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,880
your 850s your 1310s

3029
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,040
that's the stuff that remember the human

3030
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,800
eye is not evolved to look at infrared

3031
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,480
so it does a pretty good job of blocking

3032
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,800
it out but the closer the signal is to

3033
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,480
what you normally look at the easier it

3034
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,840
is to get through the cornea and the

3035
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,520
further away it is the more your cornea

3036
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:27,440
just says no uh so the high the 1550s

3037
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,719
the things that you think of as these

3038
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:30,719
big high-powered systems actually do a

3039
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:32,000
much better job of not going through

3040
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,840
your eye whereas the things that you

3041
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,360
don't think of as high power systems are

3042
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,440
the ones that actually do uh so this is

3043
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,520
a like very very

3044
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,480
brief summary of kind of what the power

3045
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,119
class requirements would be at like 1550

3046
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:46,800
but it's it's really complicated there's

3047
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,239
a big table and there's a there's a

3048
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:49,280
whole document that you can pay a

3049
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:53,040
thousand dollars to get which i have

3050
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,520
uh so optical safety uh routers every

3051
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,440
router that you will ever find for the

3052
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,679
most part uh is a class one if it's a

3053
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,600
plugable optic of blah blah blah it's a

3054
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,679
class one it won't hurt you it's fine um

3055
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:06,080
even the long reef so 200 kilometer it's

3056
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:07,360
it's not because it's actually a

3057
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,880
brighter optics because it's more

3058
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,920
sensitive in its receive um the only

3059
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,080
time you move into anything that's

3060
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,159
interesting is uh when you move into

3061
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:17,760
optical amplifiers so now you're

3062
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,920
starting to put out uh power levels that

3063
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,520
really matter you're in these like plus

3064
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:24,320
21s um there's there's like modern pam

3065
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,639
four systems that are like plus 27

3066
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:29,280
which is is class four

3067
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,440
uh ramen ramen is always class four

3068
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,440
ramens are very bright uh so be careful

3069
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,440
if there's a ramen amp but these all by

3070
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,040
law have to have these automatic power

3071
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,639
shut offs but if you're you're working

3072
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:40,000
and you're plugging in your 10 gig or

3073
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,600
your 100 gig lr

3074
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,920
it doesn't matter

3075
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,080
the other way that it can matter is

3076
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,480
if you have

3077
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,520
dwdm as you as you mucks more channels

3078
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,760
uh so if you take even an unamplified

3079
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,199
system but you take 40 channels and you

3080
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:56,480
shove them all together in one fiber

3081
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,040
you've now got a very bright fiber uh

3082
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,560
and even what people don't think about

3083
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,760
is like an lr4 is four lasers that are

3084
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,560
muxed together so that's that's uh six

3085
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:09,119
db brighter than what would normally be

3086
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,280
under normal conditions so uh but for

3087
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,360
the most part it's it's just never a

3088
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,560
thing that you have to worry about if

3089
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:15,760
you're you're out plugging in basic

3090
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,239
stuff um so should i be should be

3091
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:21,440
wearing safety goggles in the colo um no

3092
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,280
but be aware of of what you're working

3093
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,679
on um and don't like for the most if you

3094
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:26,800
don't hold the fiber to your eye you're

3095
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:30,000
fine um and also be careful with make

3096
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,639
sure nothing is lit when you plug in

3097
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:33,920
with a microscope

3098
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,440
so why would you even look into fiber

3099
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,679
anyways can you see it well

3100
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:39,679
technically speaking no telecom signal

3101
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:41,600
is directly visible to the human eye but

3102
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,400
if you say hey i plugged in my 850 and i

3103
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,679
saw red what you're seeing is a side

3104
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:47,920
band uh it's it's not

3105
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,520
precise and you're seeing a little bit

3106
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,719
of red

3107
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:53,280
most of it is is in infrared but a cool

3108
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,520
trick that i used to use but they they

3109
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,840
fixed these and all the new phones but i

3110
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,119
used to be able to take your camera

3111
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:00,480
phone out and plug it up and it would

3112
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,800
see ir very well but as they try to make

3113
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,080
the picture quality better they start

3114
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,840
putting more filters on the glass but

3115
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,960
you can you can see the ir that way

3116
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,960
so people ask can optical transmitters

3117
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,960
be damaged by over can you damage a

3118
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,679
thing with an overpowered transmitter um

3119
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:18,639
and like i said when you

3120
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:20,880
yes no so when you talk about a long

3121
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,880
reach optic what happens is in order to

3122
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,320
get longer and longer reach you're more

3123
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,800
and more sensitive and so that if you

3124
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,639
you take an 80 kilometer optic you take

3125
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:31,199
two of them back to back yes and there's

3126
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:33,040
what's called a saturation point and a

3127
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,800
damage point so this is

3128
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,800
this is like a probably a 15 year old

3129
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,280
slide from 10 gigs or something but you

3130
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,760
can see that in lr it's completely

3131
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,239
impossible even if you you take a

3132
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:45,840
full power transmitter and plug it in

3133
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,599
right into a receiver you're way outside

3134
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:50,639
of anything in a 40 kilometer optic you

3135
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,040
can move into a point of saturation you

3136
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,400
move into a point where it doesn't work

3137
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:57,119
but not damaged and then in a long reach

3138
01:49:57,119 --> 01:49:58,960
zr a kind of optic you can absolutely

3139
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:02,080
damage the optic um

3140
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,119
people ask do i need to be concerned

3141
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,599
about bend radius yes it's a real issue

3142
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:07,760
and in fact if you want to like the way

3143
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,520
that you find weird loose fibers is you

3144
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,719
plug a red light on the end and you go

3145
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:12,159
and you bend the fiber and you see it

3146
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:14,400
just like that um

3147
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:15,920
as you bend it past its critical angle

3148
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,920
it makes the light leak out

3149
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,000
um critical bend radius something

3150
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,280
something something probably talk about

3151
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,159
that uh can two transceivers of it so um

3152
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:25,599
cool thing that a lot of people don't

3153
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:27,679
understand is the optics don't actually

3154
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:29,360
have to be the same frequency to talk to

3155
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:31,520
each other uh coherent they do because

3156
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,360
that's how coherent works but everything

3157
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,040
else you can take a 1310 to make it talk

3158
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:38,000
to a 1550 and it works just fine

3159
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,840
dwdma systems that are built on single

3160
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,280
strand

3161
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,119
use this

3162
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:44,719
the only gotcha about the whole thing is

3163
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:47,119
it'll make your optical power meeting

3164
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:49,280
wrong so if you expect your 1310 you get

3165
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,199
a 1550 you'll be off by a couple dbs you

3166
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:54,080
have to make sure your mode is set right

3167
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,920
but it's a it's a cool trick to let you

3168
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,400
do weird things so like if you only have

3169
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:01,040
one lr and one er optic you can get 30

3170
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,760
kilometers of reach because the one side

3171
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,280
is more sensitive

3172
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,760
and the other side is more power and it

3173
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:10,400
balances out

3174
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,159
do i really need to clean the fiber yes

3175
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:14,320
you do

3176
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,000
if you think about the mating force of

3177
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,400
2.2 pounds over a 200 micron area it's

3178
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,320
45 000 pounds per square inch of

3179
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,080
pressure so if you have a tiny little

3180
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:23,679
piece of dust in there and these things

3181
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:25,679
come together it will literally chip the

3182
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,360
end of the the connector and it will

3183
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:30,480
just permanently damage it

3184
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,320
other miscellaneous fiber information

3185
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,400
how fast is light treble and fiber

3186
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,760
so you can do the math on this and you

3187
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:39,840
can see that uh one millisecond um

3188
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:43,360
of propagation time is 200 kilometers or

3189
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,719
uh you know cut that in half for a round

3190
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:46,159
trip time that you see in a tracer out

3191
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:48,480
so when the fiber goes 100 kilometers it

3192
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,400
has added one millisecond of latency and

3193
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,960
if you go why why is my latency much

3194
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,400
higher than that remember fiber's never

3195
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,599
laid in straight lines it's probably

3196
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:57,119
going into weird loops and has lots of

3197
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:58,639
spools and things like that but that's

3198
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:00,320
that's the basic distance calculation on

3199
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:01,440
it

3200
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,080
and that is about it with a few minutes

3201
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,239
for questions

3202
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:14,970
[Applause]

3203
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:19,599
well um thank you richard uh we do have

3204
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:22,639
some questions from the virtual audience

3205
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:24,880
um we'll take one from the virtual

3206
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,960
audience first and then from the in

3207
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,159
person

3208
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:32,320
uh first question is from adera dexton

3209
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,320
how did they figure out the dispersion

3210
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,560
correction stuff who was the first to

3211
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:39,520
say hey just leave a big spool of fiber

3212
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,119
and see what happens

3213
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:43,760
uh i don't know who specifically but

3214
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:44,960
it's

3215
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,960
the thing if you look at historically

3216
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,960
what happens is some some scientists in

3217
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,800
a lab somewhere created a thing probably

3218
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:54,000
40 50 years before it became

3219
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,840
used in the industry

3220
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,840
and it only existed in a in a very

3221
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,080
specific lab in very specific conditions

3222
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:02,000
and then they go okay what can we do

3223
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,440
with that and someone will eventually

3224
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,440
create it so they knew a lot about the

3225
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:08,080
chemical engineering of the the

3226
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:10,080
composition of the fiber the atoms how

3227
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:11,920
it worked why it worked what that light

3228
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:15,599
looked like 40 50 years before and when

3229
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:17,199
you actually go to build a system they

3230
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:18,960
refer to that engineering to figure out

3231
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,560
how to make it work

3232
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,960
awesome

3233
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:25,119
please state your name and

3234
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:27,440
your affiliation hi alex vladska

3235
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,040
netbusters.com

3236
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,199
uh actually kind of interesting question

3237
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:34,239
you gave us the speed for fiber but i

3238
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:35,840
noticed that there's different speed

3239
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,360
between fiber

3240
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:39,840
and copper in long hauls can you tell us

3241
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,599
what the difference is different speed

3242
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:43,920
between fiber and copper

3243
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:46,080
so when light is propagating through

3244
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:49,840
glass it's transmitting at like .67 c so

3245
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,679
two thirds the speed of light

3246
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:53,520
when electrical signals are moving

3247
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:54,480
through

3248
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:57,599
uh rf copper uh there's different

3249
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:00,639
propagation so people do like that's

3250
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:02,639
that's why low latency high frequency

3251
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:04,159
stuff is done with microwaves because it

3252
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:06,800
transmits faster that's why spacex is

3253
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,960
creating a low latency product with

3254
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,800
lasers between birds because it's

3255
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,960
actually lower latency to send it up and

3256
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:15,280
go through a free space laser than it is

3257
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:16,800
to go through fiber

3258
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:17,920
and then you get into all kinds of

3259
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,719
shenanigans like hollow core fiber

3260
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:22,800
we could talk about that for hours

3261
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,159
thank you

3262
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:26,080
thank you uh moving on to the second

3263
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,719
question from the um

3264
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:31,199
online audience it's from tony tober

3265
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:32,880
it's always seemed to me that the

3266
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,920
economics of way length on demand setups

3267
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:37,280
aren't compelling

3268
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:38,960
example deploy

3269
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,040
a bunch of expensive gear just in case

3270
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,199
the demand shows up am i missing

3271
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:44,719
something

3272
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:45,920
uh

3273
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:49,119
yeah welcome to taco um it depends right

3274
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:51,520
so if demand shows up and you can charge

3275
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,480
a bunch of money for it then sure um

3276
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,320
but yes where the industry is obviously

3277
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,920
littered with bad investments and and

3278
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,239
things that are spent uh it it is very

3279
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:03,040
much a trade-off between uh if you're

3280
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,880
trying to build an optical transport

3281
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,400
network where you can deliver any

3282
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,239
service between any point for any

3283
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:10,560
customer you're an at t your verizon you

3284
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:13,119
build in a very specific way when you

3285
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:14,719
are a google and a facebook and you're

3286
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:16,560
trying to build for high efficiency

3287
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,040
transport to support a packet network or

3288
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,639
something else you build in a radically

3289
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:21,920
different way

3290
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:25,280
so i i personally live more in the

3291
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,760
low price per bit world and so i try to

3292
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,520
avoid rotoms i try to avoid things that

3293
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,360
will destroy my os and r and i try to

3294
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,280
avoid all of that dynamic tunability

3295
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,040
stuff but there's there's absolutely a

3296
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,639
benefit for it if you live in the other

3297
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:38,000
world

3298
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,360
perfect

3299
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,599
please state your name and affiliation

3300
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:45,760
hey hi i'm brian fields i'm with nokia

3301
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,000
i actually have one thing it's kind of a

3302
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,599
comment and it says don't give comments

3303
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:51,920
but uh something i've used that kind of

3304
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,840
separates the pros from the hacks before

3305
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,280
like for interviews

3306
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:56,320
um

3307
01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:01,040
i asked somebody what's 0dbm plus dbm

3308
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,719
you don't have to answer that it's just

3309
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:04,960
it's it's a thinking question um my

3310
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:06,320
actual question

3311
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:08,719
is um and this is early in your talk you

3312
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:10,880
said multi-modal fiber is more expensive

3313
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,040
i'm wondering why that is is it just

3314
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,719
economies of scale or

3315
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:17,520
why good question not sure um it's i

3316
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,360
mean it's not appreciably more expensive

3317
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:22,000
but it's like 50 more expensive i mean

3318
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,199
you know it would add up if you did a

3319
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:24,480
lot of multi-mode

3320
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:25,840
but you you'll definitely you'll see

3321
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:28,239
this uh where you're like oh i've got a

3322
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:31,520
100 optic that needs eight lanes of

3323
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,599
multi-mode and a data center well you

3324
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:35,360
went from using a two dollar cable to

3325
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:37,520
using a thirty dollar cable because

3326
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:39,119
you've added more strands and moved into

3327
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:40,560
multi-mode

3328
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,880
okay thanks

3329
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,480
and labor

3330
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,320
uh one more question from the live

3331
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:47,360
audience

3332
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:50,159
um is hollow fiber a real usable

3333
01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:51,920
technology today will it be in the

3334
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:52,800
future

3335
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:55,440
with less.net

3336
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:58,560
um interesting question so i'm told by

3337
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,880
the people that know that it is a thing

3338
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,639
that people use

3339
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:04,639
uh but if you think about it in a for

3340
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:07,360
hfts right where they're they're out my

3341
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:10,239
optimizing nanoseconds uh if you think

3342
01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:12,480
about it in a practical sense what's the

3343
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:13,679
likelihood you're going to be able to

3344
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:15,360
splice fiber that you need to maintain a

3345
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,679
vacuum on right this is this is not

3346
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:18,960
going to be a thing that you're going to

3347
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,440
run across in in the real world but if

3348
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,280
you're a very very very specific

3349
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:27,199
customer doing very specific things yeah

3350
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:28,239
great

3351
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:30,239
please state your name and affiliation

3352
01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:33,280
hi i'm barry cook and i do contract work

3353
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,920
for fast metrics and atherton fiber and

3354
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,159
i was wondering if you had any more

3355
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:41,360
information on 1 by 32 splitters and the

3356
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:43,599
loss you incur and also

3357
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:45,760
bi-directional fiber as it relates to

3358
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,280
that

3359
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,440
so the the loss on the splitter is

3360
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,199
exactly what you would expect so if you

3361
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:53,119
split a one by two it's a three db loss

3362
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:55,040
plus a little bit of overhead right um

3363
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,920
so the the technology that is mostly

3364
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,199
used for that is what's called a plc

3365
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:02,080
splitter um so i forget what a 30 deals

3366
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:05,599
are like 20 db or something it's it's um

3367
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:07,440
i forget i'll top my head but it's uh

3368
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,280
it's very cheap it's very common it's

3369
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:10,639
very commonly used for those

3370
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:12,400
distribution systems but what do you

3371
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:14,080
mean bi-directional

3372
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:16,960
um for fiber to the home i i've seen

3373
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:19,360
some bi-directional fiber in use

3374
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:20,800
so you don't have to

3375
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:23,840
into fibers to each house um so with an

3376
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,119
attenuator it's hard to know which

3377
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:28,880
i mean i guess which direction is

3378
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,800
supposed to be attenuated i guess that's

3379
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,639
my question so when you go through the

3380
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:34,800
splitter and it's weird right so if you

3381
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,880
you think well i took the signal and

3382
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:39,520
split it 32 ways so i get 132nd of my

3383
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,760
signal but i'm going the other way i'm

3384
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:43,520
transmitting this thing what's my loss

3385
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,679
it's the exact same uh you will get the

3386
01:58:45,679 --> 01:58:48,880
same loss going in because it's okay uh

3387
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,719
it doesn't it doesn't you know that's

3388
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:52,480
how it works um

3389
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:55,040
so you'll get much less loss if you just

3390
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:57,199
use a mux at that point but that might

3391
01:58:57,199 --> 01:58:59,520
be more expensive than a splitter so

3392
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,800
if you're doing fiber the home what

3393
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,080
you're

3394
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:03,760
you're using fiber in a very different

3395
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:05,679
way than a data center it's it's a

3396
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:08,960
glorified cable at that point uh it's

3397
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,719
