good morning everyone i hope you guys

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,559
are all doing well and have survived the

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,719
festivities of the night before

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,640
um we've got a kind of a tight schedule

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,520
so i'll kind of jump right into things

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,320
so

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,000
first thing i'd like to talk about is

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,199
the icann isak nanog

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,600
outreach efforts

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,280
the first fruits of those laborers are

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,520
starting to come about and

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,039
they've been pretty magnificent for the

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,239
short period of time that we've been

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,000
working on them our goal is to

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,159
collaborate together bring our resources

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,560
together and see how we can better

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,040
outreach efforts within north america

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,760
and our early accomplishments are that

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,360
isec will be sponsoring individuals to

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,159
from underserved regions to attend nanog

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,560
events very much like the nci program

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,240
that we have

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,400
nana will also leverage our discourse

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,280
community forum as a way to support

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,079
outreach efforts within the underserved

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,479
regions so that we can get um

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,520
volunteers to scan those

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
discourse lists and to be able to help

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,920
people once they leave the events to be

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,520
able to get that the help and resource

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,280
they need to continue to support their

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,720
community communities

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,520
um icann has also submitted a talk for

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
nano 85 coming up in montreal

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
and nana will also be presenting at

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
icon

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,439
73 so we're trying to find ways that we

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,520
can collaborate together to further

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,040
outreach initiatives within north

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,439
america

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,000
development updates

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,439
so these are lists of some of the

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,878
projects they're going to be working on

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,758
for

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,640
2022. uh first and foremost is the

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
meeting appointment tool we know that's

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
been something that's been a strong

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,080
demand for the community and also from

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,959
our sponsors and we're addressing that

63
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
features functionality and scope of work

64
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
have been shared with our community beta

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
testers for feedback

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,400
we've started ui development on it

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
and once that once the ui is complete

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,879
within the next 30 days we'll pass it on

69
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,840
to our beta testers for evaluation and

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,879
for comments and feedback um once that

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,239
is all cleared out we start working on

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,239
the backend functionality with the goal

73
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,080
of having a uh

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,440
beta in nanog85 in montreal and then the

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,519
final version to be released

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,519
at nanog86

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,160
in addition at 96 we're going to bring

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
back our on-demand

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
on-demand batch printing service so you

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,440
will get your badges print this right

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
away at printers and queues and we'll

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,800
also be making some extensive updates to

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
the program

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,360
uh committee tool

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
uh nano community forum so um the

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,680
network community forum is a

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,760
as a piece that we're trying to help and

88
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
expand how we can outreach to our

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,519
community how we can get people involved

90
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,760
in the conversation how can we maintain

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,480
community beyond our meetings um right

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,560
now we meet three times a year and then

93
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,319
when you leave this place we're trying

94
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,040
to continue that conversation commit con

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,879
continue that community one of the

96
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,480
things that we're doing to extend that

97
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,280
is to have affinity groups so affinity

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
groups are designed to foster community

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,680
and self

100
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,200
organization groups

101
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,799
which would have expanded the community

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,720
form sorry

103
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
screw that

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
we're expanding the community forum to

105
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
include affinity groups they're designed

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,920
to allow

107
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,159
like-minded people you know who want to

108
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,760
have common who have common interests to

109
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,480
get together and to form groups and

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,159
interests that that they that they care

111
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,159
about um we've created a few groups to

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,640
get started and um but we if you

113
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,599
interested in a group that you don't

114
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,760
find in our forum you can just reach out

115
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,280
to us and we'll add it

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,000
so to give you kind of a an overview of

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,079
how it works and functions here's kind

118
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
of the home page of our community group

119
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,639
if you would look on your lower

120
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,320
i guess that would be for you the lower

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,400
left hand side you'd see a mailing list

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
scrolling down from there you'd see a

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,919
complete list of different groups that

124
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,240
you can intend to participate in

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
so for example i'm going to use the

126
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
example of the walking affinity group

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,400
so here's what it would look like all of

128
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,560
our groups can mirror a mailing list so

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,960
in this case if you see there's an email

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,880
address walking at community.net.org

131
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
you can

132
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
function it functions just like mailman

133
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
would you can send an email to it and

134
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,560
get an email response you can set up

135
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,639
your preferences to how you want to be

136
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,560
notified and i'll talk about that in a

137
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
minute if it's a group that you're

138
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,479
interested in if you look it over on the

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
which would be the uh right hand side

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
you'll see a little bell icon next to

141
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,840
topics if that's something you're

142
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,600
interested in being alerted on you can

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
click on that and then emails would come

144
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,520
to your notifications depending on how

145
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,600
you want to be notified if you look up

146
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,280
in the corner and up your right hand

147
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
corner you see a little icon of my face

148
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
that little indicator for me says i have

149
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,400
some messages that are there so either i

150
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
can see them when i log in i can get

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,320
them sent to me once a week i can get

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,000
sent to me daily i can get them sent to

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
me immediately just depending on how it

154
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,800
choose

155
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,680
so dinesh was wonderful to post in here

156
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,960
and dennis said morning walks so i

157
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,320
clicked on that and so here i saw

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,479
an insert for joining me on a morning

159

too bad for those who missed out

164
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,360

165
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
underneath that little wrench icon it

166
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,520
likewise in that little lower bottom if

171
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,080
i wanted to only be notified about

172
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,759
what's going on in this post i could

173
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,000
click on the bell icon at the lower

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,240
right hand corner and i would only see

175
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,479
receive notifications on that particular

176
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,639
thread and not the whole thread in and

177
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,560
of itself so you have control on how you

178
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,039
can interact with it

179
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,440
in your preferences i can then talk

180
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,680
about notifications and here i've listed

181
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,960
emails so i can determine how often i

182
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,360
get emails related to this thread and

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,680
how they work or how the the the forum

184
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
in general

185
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
there's also drills down many

186
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
preferences you can set for yourself so

187
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,080
you can interact with it through a web

188
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,759
browser or you can also interact it

189
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,319
through via email

190
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
so is another example to look at here is

191
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,759
our mailing list so

192
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,800
we have a read only feed of the nano

193
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,240
mailing list that you can go into you go

194
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
to community.nano.org

195
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,639
you can search through it the complete

196
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,319
mailing list from it's from its

197
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,240
inception i guess there's something like

198
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
51 000 posts in here and you're able to

199
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
go in and find a post that you're

200
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
interested something recent piers

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,759
digging in so a recent post on vpn

202
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,160
connections again you can see off to the

203
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,840
right hand side this was posted on

204
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,240
february 10th there's one of

205
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,039
43 threads connected to it

206
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,120
how long ago was the last thread again i

207
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,960
can choose to be notified just on this

208
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,199
particular thread

209
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,120
and you can see there in the block who

210
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,759
all has connected and commented on that

211
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,599
thread so again right now mailman is

212
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,360
read only but just kind of give you an

213
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,599
idea of how the community service server

214
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,400
can work and function for you

215
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
so the affinity groups that we have

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,759
starting out will be

217
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,520
events in social gathering women of

218
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,639
technology diversity and tech coffee

219
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,639
kids

220
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,759
lbtqt plus

221
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,960
running walking whiskey connoisseurs

222
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,840
yoga automation dns ird rpki and

223
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
security again if there's any groups

224
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,120
that you're looking for that you're not

225
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,039
seeing please let us know we're happy to

226
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,800
add them for you

227
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
so if you have any suggestions please

228
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,400
send them to feedback at nano.org

229
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,280
so moving into program committee updates

230
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,639
up next we're going to have elizabeth

231
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,599
colley present elizabeth cully is the

232
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,560
program committee secretary um she also

233
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,958
works as a appearing coordinator for

234
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,559
comcast and um liz culley went down this

235
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,880
path of trying to explore how the

236
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,640
pandemic affected nanog events

237
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,880
and god bless her heart she went down

238
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,680
this rabbit hole and she found all this

239
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,399
data about our programs how they work

240
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,920
and how they operate

241
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
it's an amazing undertaking and my

242
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,399
little nickname for her is data because

243
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,240
when you see what she's done it's

244
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,880
absolutely amazing so that being said go

245
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,320
ahead and roll the video she couldn't

246
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
attend him personally but she's with us

247
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,000
in spirit

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,320
thank you for having me here today so

249
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
the purpose of this research project was

250
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,560
to see how the pandemic impacted nanog

251
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,480
attendance and it grew to look at how

252
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,120
nanog attendance has evolved over time

253
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,720
so we start with attendance data from 72

254
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,519
nanogs that we have records for

255
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,360
the records actually start in february

256
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
1998 in albuquerque and the average

257
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,000
number of attendees across all these

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,959
nanox is around 667

259
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,800
individuals per nano

260
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
what we see though is that there has

261
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
been a little bit of a difference

262
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,959
between 1998 and 2015 average attendance

263
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,480
was 515. between 2015 and the start of

264
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,560
the pandemic march 2020 the average was

265
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,959
over a thousand and for the past four

266
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,160
virtual nanos it's been around 745.

267
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
we do see that by season june anags are

268
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,320
14 more well attended than

269
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,079
february nanags which are around 596 on

270
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,320
average and the october november nana

271
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,480
kind of splits the difference and a lot

272
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,839
of people if you've been to nanak

273
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,000
recently you kind of wonder what was it

274
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,560
like all the way back then in 1012 where

275
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,959
nanox were much smaller

276
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,440
you know prior to the pandemic we were

277
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
having a thousand up to 1300 people at

278
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
namog and back in the day it was five

279
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,279
six hundred people and you can actually

280
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,360
find that out because today's in-person

281
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
attendance is close to 500 and so it's

282
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,680
basically like going back in time ten

283
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,079
years just to be at an anarch that is

284
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,160
much smaller and more intimate so what

285
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,240
we know is that eighteen thousand two

286
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
hundred and eighty two individuals have

287
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,640
come to nanag at least once the majority

288
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,760
of people so seventy seven percent

289
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,240
really only attend once or twice uh

290
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
there have four percent of people though

291
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,279
that's about 733 have come more than 10

292
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,120
times and i think we can kind of

293
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,519
consider these people to be regulars we

294
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,440
know that there were 210 people who

295
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,640
attended between 21 and 40 times 31 who

296
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,600
attended before between 40 and 60 times

297
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
and nine people attended between 61 and

298
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,440
70 times

299
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,640
there are

300
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
22 individuals who have attended more

301
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,440
than 50 times and this is a list of

302
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
people who have attended more than 50.

303
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,920
so we do have records missing for the

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,399
first 11 nanogs so these numbers are

305
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,200
relative they reflect only the 72 nanox

306
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,519
that we have attendance records for and

307
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
i just wanted to point out though that

308
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,959
the people on this list

309
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,880
are not just people who have attended

310
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,959
nanog very often these are people who

311
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,680
have contributed hugely to nanag as an

312
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
organization

313
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,560
we know that steve and patrick are

314
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,959

from the inception like larry and steve

334
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
so we certainly appreciate all of these

335
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
individuals for everything that they

336
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,839
have done

337
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,639
so if you're at an anarch though while

338
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,880
75 of people

339
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,200
do really only come once or twice if you

340
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,440
are at an anag and you meet somebody it

341
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,360
is more likely that they will have been

342
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,760
to nanak several times before looking at

343
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,519
data from the past three years nine

344
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,240
nanox an average of 63 percent of

345
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,120
attendees have attended before and 37

346
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
are first-timers that first virtual nano

347
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
was inverted from the norm with 63

348
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,040
first-timers and 37 of her attorneys and

349
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,320
since then the average number of

350
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,639
first-timers has remained consistent

351
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,160
while the numbers of returnees has

352
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,639
fallen and sometimes you hear the

353
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,959
question asked you know as people

354
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,680
look around and say how many people here

355
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,120
at nanag are here to watch the speakers

356
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,800
and really attend the conference versus

357
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,560
how many are here to

358
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,279
do business and socialize and this chart

359
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,360
i think kind of answers that question

360
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,959
because if we look at

361
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,200
previous to the pandemic when we were

362
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
there in person we had an average of

363
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,480
around 750

364
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,040
returnees and after the pandemic when we

365
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
were really just virtual it's around 500

366
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,839
attorneys which is a drop off of around

367
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,240
250 individuals

368
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,720
so they dropped off because obviously

369
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
during virtual nano it's much more

370
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,959
difficult to socialize and do business

371
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,000
so 250 individuals across we don't know

372
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
the total number but it ranges from

373
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
around 25 to 40 percent could have been

374
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,880
of the attendees who are attending

375
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,600
previously no longer attending were in

376
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,360
theory there to socialize and do

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,800
business

378
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
so nanak has been

379
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,199
hosted in 38 different cities in north

380
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,160
america

381
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
this is the 35 cities that we actually

382
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
have attendance records for

383
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
uh the most frequently used city is san

384
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,839
francisco which was which we were at six

385
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,320
times followed by atlanta five times ann

386
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,639
arbor four times washington dc four

387
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,880
times in san jose four times and what

388
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,959
you're looking at here this graph is

389
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,440
showing the y-axis the vertical is

390
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,320
showing the average number of attendees

391
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,560
at this site and the number on top is

392
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,160
the number of times that we are at the

393
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,079
site so you can see that the virtual

394
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,120
nano had the most attendees total with

395
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
over a thousand and we had four virtuals

396
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,399
san francisco we had just under a

397
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,920
thousand on average and we've been there

398
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,600
six times chicago we had

399
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,199
750 and we've only been there once so

400
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,320
that is basically how to read this chart

401
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,519
of the 18 000 attendees who attended

402
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,160
they represented 4

403
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,959
781 different companies this data is

404
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,120
really the most surprising that i was

405
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,920
able to pull out of the

406
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,440
attendance records

407
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,760
18 of attendees that's 3 340

408
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,959
individuals

409
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,639
had at least one instance where they

410
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,680
specified no company affiliation

411
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
meaning they attended nanag without

412
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,800
saying who they were representing at

413
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,279
that point that's 12 that's 5990

414
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,279
instances of attendance where no company

415
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,120
was specified and i think this is really

416
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,160
interesting and it's something i'd

417
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,320
actually like to dig into a little more

418
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
why did this happen did this happen

419
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,839
because people couldn't be bothered to

420
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,759
put their company down or people really

421
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,720
attending nanag without even doing it

422
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
for their company or place of work i

423
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,480
think it's an interesting question so

424
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
these are the companies that most often

425
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,560
send representatives to nanog every

426
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,199
incremental number here is

427
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,880
not an individual it's an instance of

428
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
attendance by an individual and these

429
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,639
are companies that we all know and

430
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,040
you know work with and work for bionet

431
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,360
cisco and tt juniper and we certainly

432
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
appreciate all these companies who do

433
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,360
send their people to nanak so there were

434
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,920
247 different colleges and universities

435
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,240
that have been represented at nanog the

436
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,920
university of oregon

437
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,680
had the most instances of attendance

438
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
followed by the university of colorado

439
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,279
at boulder and usc

440
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,560
an average

441
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,279
there are at each nanag an average of

442
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,240
about 18 different schools in attendance

443
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
at nanog

444
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,839
so

445
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,920
in total across

446
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,839
all nanogs there have been

447
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,320
1711 it's about three percent 3.6 of

448
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,959
attendees who are there from a college

449
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,199
or university and then just looking more

450
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,360
closely at the past five years

451
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,279
both total numbers as well as a

452
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,519
percentage of attendees have fluctuated

453
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,600
so here on the left we're looking at the

454
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,759
total number of attendees for the past

455
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,079
five years averaging around 30 prior to

456
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,240
the pandemic that first virtual really

457
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,680
we got a huge jump to 124 attendees from

458
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,160
a university and then since then it's

459
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,400
that it's down to around an average of

460
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
maybe 30. and then on the right we have

461
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
percentages and we can see that that

462
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,559
first virtual nano where we had 124

463
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,480
university students that accounted for

464
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,439
almost 6 percent of all attendees at

465
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,280
that nanag you can see that number has

466
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,959
kind of fallen off since then from to

467
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,400
about two percent

468
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,559
so the number of colleges and

469
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,600
universities represented at each nano

470
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,240
fluctuated and so this chart is showing

471
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
how many we can see that prior to the

472
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
pandemic there was a peak of about 16

473
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,760
schools

474
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,160
represented well let's ignore the 65

475
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,760
different schools that were represented

476
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,799
in the first

477
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
virtual nanog

478
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,320
but afterward there have been really

479
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,200
even ignoring the 65 actually peak of 31

480
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,039
different schools per nanog and at the

481
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,840
last nano nano 83 there were nine

482
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
different schools and universities

483
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
represented

484
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
so finally i wanted to talk about nanox

485
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,640
sponsors so there have been 56 host

486
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,799
sponsors of nanook and we absolutely

487
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,200
appreciate the support of every sponsor

488
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,400
that we have

489
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,520
13 sponsors hosted more than once

490
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,679
and i wanted to kind of draw out here i

491
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,440
put red asterisks next to companies that

492
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,000
they either no longer exist they have

493
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,760
been bought they've changed names for

494
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,200
whatever reason

495
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,160
they're not around anymore and i

496
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,000
there was a debate about should we leave

497
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,640
the name of these companies on as is or

498
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,080
should we change them to whatever they

499
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
turned into and i think it's actually

500
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,919
more interesting this way as we look

501
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,039
back at the companies that have

502
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,640
sponsored nanog it's a little bit of a

503
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,320
throwback into time

504
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,559
so that's it i hope that you guys have

505
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,520
gotten something out of this

506
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,280
presentation and i look forward to

507
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,360
seeing everybody at future nanox thank

508
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,360

509
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,400
this was great uh thanks elizabeth um

510
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,679
we're going to continue next with the uh

511
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,280
updates the program committee updates

512
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,440
and we'll come back to

513
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,360
the q a towards the end

514
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,679
i'm here to share with you um

515
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
highlights of our

516
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
program committee strategy meeting that

517
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,520
was held in january of 21st of this year

518
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,400
the entire program committee joined and

519
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,320
this was a friday afternoon everybody

520
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,640
was very active kind of

521
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,840
spent time looking at reflecting back on

522
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,080
2021 the progress that we made

523
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,000
last year the potential changes that we

524
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,440
considered making

525
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,600
uh talked about lessons learned

526
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,760
and we also spent time looking ahead uh

527
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,720
kind of what should we focus this year

528
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,840
and

529
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
related to the program

530
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,360
structure

531
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
again i want to highlight that the

532
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,760
program committee continues to focus on

533
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,559
building the best program possible

534
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,840
we are passionate about that and

535
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
we continue to work hard

536
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,879
in the in that area

537
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,760
right perspective of last year we

538
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,600
improved the program flow by

539
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,919
introductions

540
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,840
we introduced scripts for session

541
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,039
moderators

542
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,600
um you probably noticed that

543
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
we think this is uh helps with uh most

544
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,200
more consistent experience

545
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,240
we started sharing um introductions with

546
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,960
speakers ahead of time and we found that

547
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,039
to be helpful to

548
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,080
help people prepare to come up on stage

549
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,720
kind of set the tone

550
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
also again elizabeth does a tremendous

551
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,520
job

552
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,280
with collecting data

553
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,400
and as edward mentioned we

554
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,640
we look to make

555
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,039
more decisions around data

556
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,880
this is something that we find to be

557
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,280
helpful

558
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,400
speaker surveys we

559
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,840
we evolved that to where we are

560
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,400
sharing allowing for speakers to compare

561
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,159
contrast their results with other

562
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,400
presentations

563
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,360
again the value of coming here we're up

564
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,520
on stage and presenting is that at the

565
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,440
end you get to

566
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,200
receive honest feedback to help improve

567
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,159
and

568
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
finally here within the program

569
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720
committee we have a handbook

570
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,760
and this is where we document

571
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
kind of the roles and

572
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
the the things that we do behind the

573
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
scene to

574
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,480
build the program we added a checklist

575
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,320
for mentor mentee

576
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,600
training

577
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,039
this is just one example

578
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,679
potential changes that we talked about

579
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,120
is

580
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,840
considering we send annual or biannual

581
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,960
surveys

582
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
in addition to the service that we

583
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,400
receive during the conference

584
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,720
we also talked about implementing a net

585
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,520
promoter system

586
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,880
another topic was

587
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
the proposal to

588
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,400
allocate a budget

589
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
for us to enhance the program

590
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
uh again we're this i think this is a

591
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,679
good example where we continue to look

592
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,520
at what can we do to make the program

593
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
and if we had some funding would that

594
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,320
help

595
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,480
uh so we're working closely with

596
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,600
the board

597
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,520
uh to um

598
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,039
to hopefully get approval for that

599
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,480
in addition

600
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,400
automation

601
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,520
is key

602
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,280
for us to be faster and better what we

603
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,159
do

604
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,480
again behind the scene

605
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,880
the process is where if you submit a

606
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,840
talk

607
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
um a

608
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,720
program a member of the proving

609
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,799
committee is assigned and that person

610
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,480
helps you um

611
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
through the steps you have to follow

612
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:51,840
for

613
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,919
reviewing the talks and

614
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,559
there is a step there with voting every

615
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,840
member of the proven committee has to

616
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,880
vote

617
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,240
and

618
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,200
we

619
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,520
we found that if

620
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,919
if we have a way to notify on regular

621
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,039
basis

622
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,400
members of the program committee they'll

623
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,039
be more active in voting for talks so we

624
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,799
can submit talks

625
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,360
early on

626
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,240
and finally we are

627
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,039
as updates are made to talks to actual

628
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,480
presentations

629
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,360
we uh we look into uh

630
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,320
ways to um highlight that talk needs to

631
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
be revisited

632
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,520
and

633
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,280
again this is another way for us to

634
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,880
streamline the process of voting

635
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
lessons learned

636
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,679
quick observations on hybrid meetings

637
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,799
we continue to strive and do our best to

638
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,320
manage in person

639
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,960
versus pre-recorded obviously we have an

640
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,799
interest to

641
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,679
have people in person when possible

642
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,240
um also i think we found a good way to

643
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,720
balance with remote and in-person q a

644
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,240
and

645
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,840
with all the technologies that we have

646
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,679
available

647
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,679
related to panels we decided we're going

648
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,120
to either we're going to do a panel here

649
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
in person or either

650
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
fully remote we're not going to try to

651
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,960
do a hybrid

652
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,240
and

653
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,480
we're also looking to

654
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
start additional subcommitting

655
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,720
subcommittees within the

656
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,360
program committee so that we can

657
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
kind of have more focused uh

658
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,159
groups on certain areas and

659
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,919
empower

660
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,840
more the program committee members

661
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,320
and finally planning ahead um you know

662
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
we we talked about uh talked about

663
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
specific themes for upcoming analog

664
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,279
meetings

665
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,480
but as a requested popular topics again

666
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,960
an example is for our next nano meeting

667
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,559
in montreal june 6th is the

668
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,440
the 10th anniversary of ipv6

669
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,760
launch so that's going to be a big one

670
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,120
for us

671
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,080
um

672
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,200

677
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,200
the past so we'll continue to work on

678
