2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,440
my name is paul kagan i'm a cyber

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,760
subject matter expert

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,399
at new systems in huntsville alabama

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,400
my role in new systems i specialize in

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,039
telecommunications service provider

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,640
technologies

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,439
and

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,119
cyber security

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,480
and also

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,039
have a strong interest in space systems

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,119
and so this presentation we're going to

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,479
go into

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,280
some real world examples uh what has

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,360
been happening happening historically in

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,879
space

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,160
and uh talk about some theoretical

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,879
uh possible cyber security issues

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,680
and we'll go into some best practices

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,480
and recommendations for securing space

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,920
systems

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,199
but uh

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,719
in the realm of space systems we're

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,480
specifically going to focus on the

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,440
spacecraft for the majority of this talk

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
specifically satellites

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,080
to get started this is an example of a

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,439
ground of a ground system network

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,600
in this case we're looking at a ground

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,799
system

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,920
for nasa where they have locations

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
around the world so that they have

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,479
complete coverage of satellites as they

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,159
orbit the earth

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,759
and you can see

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,759
that they have like mentioned they have

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,840
ground systems across all the different

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,240
hemispheres

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,960
from the north and the south

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
of the globe

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,920
so that they have

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,880
complete coverage as the spacecraft are

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,640
orbiting the earth

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
depending on the size of the

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,680
constellation may not have this large of

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,320
a

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,560
ground system network

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,840
one thing call out is as

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
space systems are evolving this next

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,720
generation of space systems a great

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,360
number of the newer ground systems are

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,880
actually being deployed in the cloud

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,040
just like we're we're deploying a lot of

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
the enterprise and service provider

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
services

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,200
in the cloud so is space ground systems

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,758
you have amazon

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,280
microsoft azure is also uh in the ground

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,840
system business and google is getting

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
into the ground system business uh i've

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
been reading where spacex

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,400
is working with with google for their

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
new uh satellite constellation that

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
they're deploying and there's a there's

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,160
other

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,800
cloud vendors that are providing

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,200
uh ground system services as well when

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,599
we talk about spacecraft

69
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,640
orbits

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
there's a low earth orbit you can hear

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,640
about leo

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,680
uh where you're about 160 to 2 000

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,480
kilometers above the earth that's that's

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,239
which most of what's in the news these

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,959
days and then we have a the higher earth

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,800
orbit around sixteen thousand to a

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,319
hundred thirty thirty thousand

78
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,080
kilometers of the medium earth orbit

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
uh the two thousand to

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,920
roughly almost thirty six thousand

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,680
kilometers there

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,040
close to it uh and then geo and we have

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,200
a you'll hear a great deal about geo in

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
the news as well

85
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,879
where geo is around the 35

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,560
000 36 000

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,760
kilometers

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,519
and where the geo

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,519
is more of a fixed configuration where

90
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,760
when a satellite goes up into a geo

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,799
orbit

92
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,360
it orbits with the earth so that it has

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,879
a fixed location

94
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,200
to provide say telecommunications cable

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
services for fixed locations on the

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
earth

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
so just wanted to give a brief overview

98
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
of some orbits

99
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,159
focus this com

100
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,720
our conversation for this presentation

101
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,840
is

102
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
threats to the space systems

103
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
the

104
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,239
the federation of american scientists

105
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,720
they broke it down to around five main

106
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,799
categories of threats to spacecraft

107
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,480
because this because we're going to

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
focus on the satellites in this

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,680
conversation

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,040
there's deception

111
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,799
where you're uh

112
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,280
making the targets the spacecraft report

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,799
incorrect information

114
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,480
you have disruption

115
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,760
where we're going to temporarily degrade

116
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840
the capability of the spacecraft

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,918
maybe denial where the where the

118
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,399
capabilities are being temporarily

119
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
disabled

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,240
where there may be degradation

121
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
where a capability is degraded

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,560
irreparably maybe an example of

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,440
degradation is that someone had a on the

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,000
ground or possibly in space

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,560
possibly uh

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
attack the satellite maybe from the

127
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
ground to uh damage optics with some

128
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
kind of high-powered laser possibly so

129
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,479
it's totally irreparable

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,680
or some kind of kinetic physical attack

131
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
could degrade

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,199
if it didn't just totally destroy and

133
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
then again

134
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,080
what's been in the news a whole lot here

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
lately is complete destruction of

136
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
satellites with anti-satellite weapons

137
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,880
for example where the whole world say a

138
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,800
missile hits a satellite

139
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,560
and blows the whole thing up so it's

140
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
complete destruction which could also

141
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,840
happen with debris there's a lot of

142
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,720
debris in space that could totally uh

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
cause uh destruction or

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,720
cause irreparable degradation

145
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,960
which would not be a

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,639
cyber attack

147
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,320
it just they're just the threats of the

148
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,199
debris

149
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,000
now

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,440
from a cyber threat

151
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
somewhat some some of it's not totally

152
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,680
cyber like jamming is more of electronic

153
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,320
warfare where you're going to overpower

154
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,919
the radio signal with a stronger

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,120
rf capability

156
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,600
but but electronic warfare and cyber are

157
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
merging together

158
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,720
in most

159
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
conversations these days

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
so you have jamming have malware we're

161
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,680
going to go into some examples of where

162
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
malware are being seen

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,319
spoofing the controlling payload

164
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,680
the control and

165
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
the ttc where your

166
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,240
your telemetry tracking

167
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,960
and

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
command been able to send commands and

169
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
control to the satellite manage where

170
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,680
the satellite is

171
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
being able to replay you might be able

172
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
to replay and hijack

173
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,400
connections because

174
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,280
the connections may not be encrypted you

175
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,639
might be able to just sit there and

176
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,600
passively listen to connections uh

177
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,960
eavesdropping

178
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
if you can lock into the signal and

179
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,919
listen as we mentioned earlier

180
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,520
there are some threats that are

181
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,039
reversible and others that are

182
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,080
irreversible so like somebody

183
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
just some actor

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
has the resources to actually jam the

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,639
satellite's rf signal they can start

186
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,599
jamming

187
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,440
affect the capability of the satellite

188
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,599
the communications and then when they

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,240
turn off the uh the jamming

190
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400
then the vulnerability the damage would

191
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,520
go away the vulnerability doesn't go

192
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
away but the damage would go away the

193
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,360
interruption would go away

194
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,759
whenever the like the radial signal was

195
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,000
tape removed but as you move to the

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
right

197
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
if you start

198
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,199
coming under some kind of kinetic attack

199
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,720
say a missile or some other kind of uh

200
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,319
space weapon or possibly debris uh it's

201
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,639
gonna be non-reversible you start you

202
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,160
start getting into the physical damage

203
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
to the satellite

204
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,360
spacecraft

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
that's not gonna be reversible it's

206
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,919
going to

207
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,280
take me it's going to totally damage

208
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,639
this spacecraft and take it out possibly

209
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,039
as we've seen with the recent asap

210
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,199
events in the news there are a lot of

211
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,160
different actors in these

212
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,720
that are they may be looking at space

213
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,479
just like with an enterprise you have

214
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,400
you know the nation state the military

215
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,199
intel agencies possibly uh insider

216
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,560
threats

217
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,199
somebody you know an individual and

218
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,120
depending on the resources

219
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,800
someone might be able to with minimal

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
resources be able to passively listen

221
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,160
to uh satellite network traffic or

222
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,560
someone with more resources are going to

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,800
be able to possibly not have to deal

224
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,599
with

225
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,720
not wait for just open

226
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
satellite communication that they might

227
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,680
be able to to

228
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
actually hack into a ground system

229
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
and be able to explore the ground system

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,599
and in turn

231
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,599
exploit the trust relationships for the

232
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,599
spacecraft and take control of the

233
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,240
spacecraft if if they have the

234
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,559
capabilities and skills to do that

235
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,599
and we're going to get into some

236
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,719
examples

237
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,880
where some more sophisticated threat

238
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,599
actors were actually able to

239
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,000
to take control of spacecraft

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
when i like to

241
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
talk about uh

242
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
attack strategies

243
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,680
looking at

244
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,519
going after a system i like to go and

245
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,920
develop an attack tree

246
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
to better understand how an adversary

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,080
may want to go after the target i do a

248
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,399
lot of red teaming penetration testing

249
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,000
for different

250
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,399
organizations so i like to go map out

251
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,000
figure out what the the target is going

252
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,680
to be and come up with a strategy and

253
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,839
represent it in that factory so i got a

254
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,519
good understanding of how we may proceed

255
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,680
to accomplish our goals and

256
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,760
this is real high level not totally in

257
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,560
absolute detail but but uh going after

258
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,920
satellite might want to go out to the

259
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
ground station

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,800
maybe

261
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
you know

262
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
emulate an insider

263
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,480
that has access or look at

264
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,200
someone who has remote access

265
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
depending on what kind of

266
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,839
remote access is available into that

267
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,480
ground system uh you know you would all

268
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,640
typically historically you would think

269
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,959
that that a satellite ground system

270
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,360
would be air gap but now we've got a the

271
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,040
ground systems moving to the cloud where

272
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
they're accessible over the internet so

273
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,279
so there there is going to there is

274
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,120
could be some remote access that could

275
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,760
be be exploited to get access into

276
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,160
satellite ground system theoretically

277
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
there is conversations about a satellite

278
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,480
to satellite type attack

279
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
but right now i have not been able to

280
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
find anything out in the open source

281
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,240
where that has been done

282
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,160
uh by anyone yet where there's been any

283
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,920
kind of cyber attack

284
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,600
going from side to side that might be

285
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,399
something that we do we see uh

286
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,640
published in the future but but i have

287
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,839
not personally been able to find

288
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,360
anything on that yet

289
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,040
uh it could be someone throws up an

290
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,079
unauthorized ground system uh capability

291
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,600
and starts trying to take control of the

292
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,360
satellite and we have some examples of

293
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,399
this where

294
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,720
um that that could be happening where

295
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,640
they could uh try to control the side

296
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,480
from an unauthorized ground system

297
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,120
speaking of uh malware a lot of people

298
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,880
have talked about stuxnet in the past

299
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,240
but one thing that jumped out at me

300
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
doing research for

301
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,760
satellite vulnerabilities and what is

302
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,160
going on in the space industry

303
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
i ran across that

304
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,640
that the famous stuxnet malware

305
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,920
is suspected to have actually taken out

306
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,880
a satellite called inside 4b that was

307
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
owned by an indian

308
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,440
cable tv satellite network

309
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,480
and

310
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,279
so

311
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,519
the stuxnet was somehow able to get into

312
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,440
the ground system through the internet

313
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,959
it could have been if someone brought it

314
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,839
in

315
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,360
through an infected

316
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,240
thumb drive or some other medium or

317
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
through an affected laptop and brought

318
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,839
it in to

319
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,399
the ground system more

320
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
but but some somehow

321
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,160
it got brought into that network it

322
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,640
wasn't just specified how it got there

323
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
but it was able to compromise the grant

324
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,720
get into the ground system and find its

325
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,760
way on the inside 4b where it said that

326
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
inside 4b

327
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,000
was running the same

328
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,120
plc

329
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,640
software

330
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,200
running utilizing the same plc and the

331
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,040
same one cc software

332
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,320
uh to manage it that uh the ins

333
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,959
that was targeted by stuxnet

334
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,440
so it ended up stuxnet ended up

335
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
disabling the inside 4b satellite

336
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
so it's one example

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
that is out

338
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,360
i'm in the open source where malware has

339
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
actually

340
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,320
disabled a satellite

341
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,839
as i've been uh studying satellite

342
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,200
communications and learning more about

343
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,079
space systems it's fascinating to me

344
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,320
how many of the space systems the

345
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,560
satellites are not using encryption i

346
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,079
would you know one would assume that

347
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,279
encryption is being used because you

348
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,720
would not want anyone to interfere with

349
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,399
your satellite communications

350
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
well it turns out that uh

351
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,160
doing a lot of research

352
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
that a great deal of the satellite

353
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
communications are not encrypted it's

354
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,680
recommended to be encrypted that you use

355
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920
encryption just like internet traffic if

356
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,839
you want privacy to encrypt it but a lot

357
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,680
of the satellite traffic is not

358
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,800
encrypted

359
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,040
and there's a lot of

360
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,600
tools and capabilities available to ease

361
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,480
drop

362
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,880
and to listen to the

363
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,399
unencrypted traffic

364
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,240
and the reason that the traffic is not

365
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
always encrypted is because of the cost

366
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
of hardening the satellites against

367
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,519
radiation

368
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,639
there's

369
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,279
a lot of space weather radiation coming

370
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,760
from the sun solar flares etc

371
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,320
that can disrupt communications with a

372
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,480
satellite and those that radiation can

373
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,399
that space weather up in the upper

374
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,440
atmosphere can interrupt

375
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,360
not only interrupt communications but it

376
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
can also

377
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,959
affect electronics

378
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,440
and over time degrade

379
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,160
degrade uh the system itself the

380
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,720
electronic components and

381
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,959
if there was to be some kind of like a

382
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,000
solar flare storm or what have you

383
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,480
you're having encrypted communications

384
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,360
it could

385
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,440
interrupt the encryption keying so that

386
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,040
you would lose your communications with

387
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,160
the sideline so it's it's easier to have

388
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,560
communications with the satellite

389
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,839
without when you don't have the

390
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,519
hardening

391
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,199
radiation hardening

392
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,720
to just not using encryption because if

393
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,600
you're going to use the encryption

394
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,560
you're going to have to make sure you

395
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,880
have really good radiation hardening on

396
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
that satellite to make sure that you can

397
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,199
maintain your communications with it

398
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,360
so that's why we don't see a hundred

399
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
percent encryption everywhere because

400
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,800
it's going to drive up the cost but that

401
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,760
also

402
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,279
makes the spacecraft inherit the

403
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,480
vulnerability and then you're in your

404
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,639
communications to be open to the world

405
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,000
to possibly

406
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,839
uh listen to if they have the right

407
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,680
equipment another example

408
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,600
of uh unencrypted satellite

409
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,760
communications being intercepted

410
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,519
is down in brazil apparently there was a

411
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,920
large large number of people that were

412
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,040
aware

413
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,519
that the u.s navy was using open

414
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,959
satellite communications in the uhf

415
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:35,839
band

416
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,800
and at one point they arrested 39 people

417
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,199
across six brazilian states

418
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
for illegal utilization of the navy's

419
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,000
satellites

420
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,720
now

421
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,680
and

422
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,279
my understanding is

423
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,199
the research is shortly after they

424
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,839
arrested that group of people others

425
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,560
started back using those satellites

426
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
again because they were open on

427
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,680
encrypted communications it was

428
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,279
available so they used it another

429
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,320
example

430
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,959
of unencrypted satellite communications

431
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,720
being uh

432
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,320
utilized is uh was the turla malware

433
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,600
where

434
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,079
the the command control of the network

435
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,519
would use

436
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,760
it would both use both the uh the

437
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,040
landline

438
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,880
and it would use the satellite

439
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
to do its command control when it could

440
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,120
it could uh broadcast down from the

441
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,399
satellite and hit systems that it that

442
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,720
had been exploited and be able to

443
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
communicate with them

444
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,000
through the satellite and you could not

445
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,399
see the synchronous connection it was

446
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
async so part of the connection went

447
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
over a landline and part of the

448
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,079
communication went over broadcast

449
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,320
satellite down

450
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,680
to the earth

451
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,360
so he made it really difficult to catch

452
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,839
very sophisticated malware to be able to

453
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,680
do that and that was the turtle attack

454
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,720
it was also another example there was uh

455
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,959
back in the iraq war

456
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,320
apparently

457
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,399
some people figured out that uh the

458
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,199
uav's uas and stuff some of the

459
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,399
space aircraft were not using encryption

460
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
and they were able to uh

461
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,680
to capture uh communications because

462
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,519
they were open unencrypted

463
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,440
using off-the-shelf commercially

464
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,519
available software to be able to go and

465
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,759
decode satellite communications i

466
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,360
mentioned this earlier this is an

467
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,639
example

468
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,160
of a

469
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
theoretical attack against satellite

470
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,600
where you would have

471
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,839
a couple satellites up in the space that

472
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,199
are communicating communication

473
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,800
satellites that are sending comms

474
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
between each other and an adversary is

475
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,959
able to

476
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,519
to push up another satellite a third

477
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,519
satellite for example

478
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,720
and be able to do a man-in-the-middle

479
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,560
type attack and intercept communications

480
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,519
between

481
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,120
satellites

482
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,360
by being able to get in close orbit

483
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,440
maybe it may be able to do a different

484
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,880
kind of cyber attacks if they're not

485
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,959
using strong encryption

486
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,560
uh just like they would on the ground

487
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,800
now more and more of the communications

488
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,240
in the long term are going to move to

489
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,279
optical

490
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,039
free space optics and that's going to be

491
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,400
harder

492
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,039
to do any do a man-in-the-middle type

493
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,079
attack when you start talking about

494
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,199
optics because it's going to be very

495
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,079
directed as you know lasers

496
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,679
so it'll be interesting to see how that

497
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,400
evolves over time a real world attack

498
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
against a satellite that's documented in

499
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,480
open source one of the first ones that i

500
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,720
read about was the rosat

501
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,599
uh

502
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,720
satellite

503
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,200
back in 1998 it was a german us

504
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,400
satellite

505
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,760
and used for looking into space

506
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,440
and apparently

507
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,960
it looks like the ground system was

508
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,160
attacked

509
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
and through the ground system

510
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
the satellite was able to be taken

511
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,120
control of and the solar panels would be

512
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
there was need to be turned

513
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,200
so that it was uh

514
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
it was damaged

515
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,000
and uh

516
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
so it was no longer usable

517
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
and attribution was pointed back to the

518
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,880
russians in the rosade attack and then

519
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
there's the landsat 7 satellite attack

520
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,039
it happened in october

521
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,559
2007

522
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,400
and it happened twice and it also

523
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,440
happened the second time in 2008

524
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,559
where

525
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,400
it was uh

526
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
taking control of for like 12 minutes

527
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
so there's another example of a

528
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,000
satellite that has been hacked

529
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,799
uh and taking taking control of

530
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,360
and then the tariff satellite

531
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,600
had experienced his experience two

532
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,960
minutes of interference in june 2008 and

533
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
then in uh

534
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,880
later in october it experienced nine

535
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,160
minutes

536
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
uh of being out of control of someone

537
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,000
else having control of the southern

538
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,120
light

539
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,480
so that's another

540
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,360
direct attack on a satellite spacecraft

541
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,760
very similar to that we have the noaa

542
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,000
weather satellites and

543
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,840
it is speculated the attribution in the

544
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,039
open source says that the chinese hacked

545
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,760
this weather weather system satellite

546
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,240
and was able to take control of it

547
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,320
for for a period of time and another

548
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,559
satellite that got taken that i was

549
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,320
surprised to hear this story about there

550
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,960
was uh the uk scott inside a lot

551
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,840
apparently there is skynet is comprised

552
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,559
of four military satellites that the uk

553
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,080
uses and in this scenario with skynet an

554
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,200
adversary was able to capture one of the

555
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,360
four satellites it's a four satellite

556
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,840
constellation for what i understand

557
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,559
and one of the satellites was taking

558
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,640
control of him was held for ransom for a

559
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,520
period

560
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,720
there's other examples

561
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,120
of cyber activities in space where on

562
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,880
the space station apparently it's very

563
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,280
common knowledge not not in the control

564
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
system of this of

565
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,880
the space station

566
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
but in the

567
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,799
where other uh

568
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,559
network functions are happening system

569
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,360
functions it is common

570
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
for there to be a malware infection

571
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,520
apparently with thumb drives at the

572
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,080
astronauts to bring in thumb drives and

573
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,679
they're bringing laptops that have

574
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,200
infections

575
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,679
that are infected in introducing malware

576
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,840
into the space station network now

577
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,760
there's nothing saying that anything has

578
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
been infected into the flight control

579
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,840
system of the space station but just in

580
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,919
the networks where the astronauts are

581
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,200
plugging in laptops etc there's been a

582
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
few cases where malware has been

583
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,080
brought onto the space station there are

584
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,360
some good

585
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,120
reference standards

586
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,480
for

587
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
securing the spacecraft both of the

588
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,880
ground systems and the spacecraft

589
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,039
themselves the consul consultative

590
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,679
committee for space data systems

591
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,960
they write the standards they're kind of

592
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,159
like the ieee itu for writing standards

593
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,280
for

594
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,200
network protocols the communication

595
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,679
standards how systems should work

596
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,840
together and integrate

597
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,360
and they also have a great deal of

598
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,799
documentation

599
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,679
and specifications for how

600
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,520
these systems should be secured how the

601
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,280
protocols should be secure how

602
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,159
cryptography should be implemented uh

603
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,080
how the various protocols should be

604
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,200
secured

605
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,919
um the ground systems and the spacecraft

606
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,520
architecture should be

607
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,720
developed to ensure security so there's

608
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
there's a good engineering best

609
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,400
practices out there

610
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,640
for space systems engineers to use as a

611
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
reference to design these systems that

612
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,480
international organizations all

613
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,000
collaborate on

614
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,799
uh

615
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,520
to develop to make sure that there's

616
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,280
some good methodologies

617
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,400
to be used

618
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
some other best practices that are out

619
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,159
there for securing space systems

620
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,240
modder

621
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,840
has a publishing best practices the mit

622
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,159
lincoln lives has published

623
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,480
documentation on best practices for

624
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
securing small satellites

625
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,919
nist is currently working on

626
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,760
a standard for

627
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,919
for commercial satellites i believe it's

628
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,960
called nist 8270

629
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,200
is the document that nist is working on

630
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
and then there's uh the committee for

631
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,320
national security systems some u.s

632
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,640
government organizations the cnss they

633
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,679
have a number of uh documents out there

634
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,320
for best practices for securing space

635
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,760
systems

636
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,320
in the aerospace corporation very

637
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,080
similar to modern mit the frdc's in the

638
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,400
u.s they have best practices for

639
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,080
for securing

640
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
space systems both architecture and

641
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,520
policies and more recently there's the

642
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,200
orbital security alliance and they have

643
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,440
recommended best practices for securing

644
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,280
satellites that are available forever

645
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,880
some things that someone you might want

646
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
to think about when you're starting to

647
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,919
work on designing

648
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,440
and building your own

649
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,720
spacecraft

650
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,760
is to

651
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,880
use the devsecops and design security

652
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,159
into the satellite from the very

653
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,159
beginning both hardware and software

654
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,520
make sure that it's hardened that you

655
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,039
have the radiation

656
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,799
hardening so that you can protect the

657
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,320
system from

658
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,600
the hostile

659
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,840
space weather environment from uh you

660
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,480
know solar the solar radiation uh

661
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,400
looking at the supply chain

662
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,360
you know the

663
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,799
the different operating systems the

664
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,159
real-time operating systems you might

665
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,720
using uh that that that whole chain of

666
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
custody is secure

667
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,080
and that the applications et cetera are

668
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
all been uh

669
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,799
that you understand where all your

670
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,960
components and software is coming from

671
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,200
look at implementing the uh zero trust

672
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,320
model

673
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,200
uh with you know with with uh defense in

674
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
depth to look at all the different trust

675
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,080
relationships and the interdependencies

676
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,919
in the in both the ground system and the

677
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,039
spacecraft

678
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,240
make sure everything is secure and

679
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
locked down

680
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,320
and encryption is being used and more

681
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,640
and more the the spacecraft that are

682
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
being deployed the next generation

683
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,520
spacecraft that are coming online

684
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,400
are going to have the ability to support

685
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,120
virtual machines and containers

686
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,559
so it's going to open up the capability

687
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,120
for doing logging

688
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,360
and increase the ability the resources

689
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,279
to do things like intrusion prevention

690
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,799
systems uh and we can be can look at

691
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,960
applying machine learning and artificial

692
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,320
intelligence

693
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
and and monitor

694
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,000
the commands that are being sent to the

695
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,520
spacecraft to make sure no one's trying

696
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
to help us manage that spacecraft and

697
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,320
we're only getting the type of commands

698
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,400
that we expect in the order we expect

699
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,000
them there's some there's not some

700
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,240
some unauthorized configuration

701
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,919
commands being sent to the system or

702
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,480
operations trying to manipulate the

703
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,039
payloads

704
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
and we need to

705
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,559
closely monitor the telemetry tracking

706
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,760
and uh control of the uh satellite and

707
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,120
also

708
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
with the a lot of the satellites are

709
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,080
being deployed now they even have like

710
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,000
a lot of them are like running linux and

711
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,440
they're being constantly patched

712
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,520
to add new features and new capabilities

713
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,039
to support the

714
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,400
control of the spacecraft and the

715
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,480
payloads we need to have really strict

716
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,799
system configuration management

717
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,120
to make sure that that constellation we

718
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,200
know all the different

719
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,240
patches and uh configuration

720
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,880
status of these systems so we know we

721
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,159
know where we're at and make sure

722
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,240
nobody's helping us manage and uh mess

723
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,000
with the configuration of these systems

724
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
as we've shown in other slides which are

725
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,559
not not only theoretical but very

726
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,880
possible for someone to uh

727
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,679
to

728
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,840
get unauthorized access to and help us

729
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,600
manage our spacecraft

730
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,039
that is the overview of uh

731
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,520
spacecraft uh system hacking that i

732
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,799
wanted to share with everyone today

733
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,240
i really appreciate the nanoh team

734
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,919
giving me an opportunity to come and

735
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,760
present it

736
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,240
at the conference and at this time if

737
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,480
there's any questions i'd be happy to

738
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,000
answer questions thank you

739
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,279
thank you paul we do have a few

740
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,000
questions for you

741
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,480
take the first question

742
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,200
on uh on the chat um

743
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,840
coming to us from uh robert carolina um

744
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,919
question is uh i take your points about

745
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,880
attacks that jeopardize the operation of

746
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,640
the sat itself and you make a good case

747
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,320
for encrypting command and control

748
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,799
signals if people who use space segment

749
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,200
encrypted traffic in the end does this

750
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,960
mean that the threat is effectively

751
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
limited to set operators rather than the

752
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,440
end users

753
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,400
well mine

754
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
what i've seen uh is

755
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,520
both the there's a lot of examples

756
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,200
that's been published

757
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,320
at

758
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,120
defcon black hat type conferences

759
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,840
where

760
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,559
end user traffic has been recorded

761
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,360
where it's out there passively open

762
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,640
uh so that someone can see

763
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
whatever whatever communications you're

764
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,039
having as an end user it's out there in

765
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,039
the clear to be sniffed just like you're

766
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,600
sniffing it off of a wired network you

767
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,440
can you can capture

768
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,640
if you've got the right equipment you

769
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,240
can capture

770
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,559
anyone's satellite traffic so if you

771
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,440
have traffic that is sensitive in nature

772
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,240
say

773
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,480
maybe it's uh some kind of industrial

774
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,039
control system scada type traffic that

775
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,399
you're utilizing uh

776
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,240
that would certainly be a concern or

777
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,760
uh you know if you have sensitive

778
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,840
information like

779
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,200
passwords that possibly in the clear

780
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,360
that someone can sniff off the wires

781
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,200
yeah they could affect the end users as

782
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,559
well as

783
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,919
you know the side of the ground system

784
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,840
thanks

785
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,080
uh next question is uh from jorge emodio

786
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,720
what are your thoughts about dtn and

787
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,480
bpv7 bp set

788
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,480
i have not i have not read up on this

789
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,880
all right well um that's

790
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,399
all the questions we have uh thank you

791
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,760
again for your presentation and time

792
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,700
today paul

793
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,760
