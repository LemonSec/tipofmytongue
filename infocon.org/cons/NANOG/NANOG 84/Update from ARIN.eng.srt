to have john here today and provide us

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,279
an update on things that have happened

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,840
at aaron

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,519
november much

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:29,919
thank since

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
okay hello everyone i'm john sweeney and

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,399
i see lee's leaving the room because he

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,520
knows i'm going to give you the right

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
answer to the question it really eight

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,760
years you can't tell what would happen

22
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,399
if those addresses came into play it

23
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,960
would all depend on policy

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,079
so

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,680
could take some years

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,000
if it was an errand if that was added to

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,239
the waitlist policy

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,480
uh we give out about

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,000
um

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,640
i don't know maybe 20

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,840
now maybe about 5 000 slash 24s a year

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,600
so there'd be if it's just a slash 8

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
divided up 13 000 would take us five

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,479
years so it all depends on how much

35
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,880
space comes back to the rirs

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,040
and what the policy is to give them out

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,920
to the

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,759
community

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,960
all right let me give you some quick

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,000
updates

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,840
things that have happened at aaron uh

42
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,159
since the last anag we run through fee

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,720
harmonization membership structure

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,119
non-off update irr and aaron 49 meeting

45
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,280
wait list and transfers and i'm trying

46
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,479
to talk a little bit fast in case

47
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,720
there's questions

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,720
so fee harmonization as of january 1st

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,360
our fee structure is flat we no longer

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,640
have an isp schedule and an end user

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,920
schedule it's flat everybody pays based

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,640
on the number of ip address resources

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
they have

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,880
whether it's v4 v6 you pay the larger

55
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,240
fee of what category you end up in

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,200
uh the only difference is we do have asn

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
only holders and they pay 150 a year

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,639
we also have a fee cap on anyone any

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,758
legacy

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,400
uh resources that are held under an lrsa

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
and that fee cap is 150

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
this year goes up 25 every year going

63
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,239
into the future

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
customer breakdown

65
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,360
we've got 15 750 customers that have

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,319
signed an rsa

67
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,319
756 that have signed an lrsa

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,400
7

69
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,160
619 that are asn only

70
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,200
and then we have 15 155 legacy

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,319
um holders that paid no fees

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,160
transaction fees that have changed

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
transfers went uh from 300 to 500

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,319
and there's new fees for or create fifty

75
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,959
dollars to or create and hundred dollars

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,720
to do an organization recovery

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
membership structure so this is

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
flattened membership structure as well

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,680
we now have anyone that has

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
either ipv4 ipv6 resources directly from

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,840
aaron becomes a service member

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
within the service members we have

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,360
general members and those are the

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,239
organizations that wish to participate

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,200
in aaron governance and and vote in our

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,959
elections and do nominations and all

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,159

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,120
excuse me to do with elections

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,959
um

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,080
the general members we had on

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,280
december 31st held their

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,239
general membership status

93
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,159
and don't have to apply

94
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,159
however they will have to vote within

95
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,560
the next three elections to keep that

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
status

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,319
service members

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,319
new service members can apply to be a

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,920
general member they just have to

100
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,000
indicate that they wish to participate

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,799

elections

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,480
if they should not vote if once they get

105
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,159
it if they don't vote in the next three

106
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,560
elections they will lose it there's no

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,640
penalty though if you lose it and you

108
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,319
decide you want it back you apply and

109
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,879

i believe it opened yesterday

137
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,720
okay wait list and transfers

138
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,520
i noticed in the last

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
uh presentation that they

140
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
the

141
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,720
presenter talked about you know if we

142
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,080
could get rid of ipv4 the faster the

143
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,039
better force people were at ipv6 well

144
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,600
some good news is that uh

145
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
wait list resources are

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,120
running very low we're getting to that

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
point at aaron anyway where we we will

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,280
not be

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,680
filling the request at the rate we have

150
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,400
been

151
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,520
over the last year and a half

152
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,840
each quarter we exhausted everybody that

153
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,600
was on the wait list whether they wanted

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,240
a 22 or 23 or 24.

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,759
um

156
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,720
last quarter we did not do that we i

157
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,360
believe gave out like around 200 out of

158
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,319
240 that were on the list it's

159
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,360
anticipated that through the year that

160
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,880
will go down

161
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,680
however we do have a few

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,880
pockets of larger space

163
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,960
that's been involved in

164
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,400
fraud or

165
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,319
other things and we're revoked and we're

166
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,360
waiting for

167
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,520
a period that we

168
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,759
hold on to them before we redistribute

169
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,880
so there might be some spurts in the

170
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,639
second third quarter

171
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,600
but

172
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
by the end of this year going in the

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
next year

174
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,160
the only space that will be given out on

175
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,919
the wait list will be space that gets

176
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
recovered

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,400
from um mostly non-payment

178
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,120
so

179
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,560
that space usually would only satisfy

180
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
20 to 30 um

181
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,840
slash 22s or 23 so

182
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,000
it's going to get very thin

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,759
and the wait list is going to get very

184
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,560
long and the time it takes to get space

185
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
off the wait list is going to be very

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,599
very long

187
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,199
um

188
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
transfers transfers are marching right

189
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,039
along lee's happy with that

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,280
in 2021 we had uh 712

191
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,599
merger and acquisitions most of those

192
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,639
were

193
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,880
getting ready to do the next category

194
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,280
which is the market transfers

195
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,240
and um and the inter rar transfers we

196
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,080
had 300 completed

197
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,400
inbound from

198
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,319
mostly from ripe and ap nick

199
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,000
947 slash 24s

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,080
outbound 8 844 24s most of that space

201
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
was legacy space

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
so um it's not a big

203
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,319
it's not a big hit to aaron's revenue

204
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,919
stream uh

205
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,840
it it actually helps a little bit

206
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,680
because it's space that we're have we

207
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,759
were having to take care of that we

208
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,879
weren't receiving anything for

209
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,380
and that's it

210
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,370
