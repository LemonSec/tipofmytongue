[Music]

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,560
i would like to welcome to the states

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,639
our next presenter

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,800
michael holberg

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,759
presenting 5g transport network

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,320
requirements and architectures

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,720
michael is a distinguished systems

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,439
engineer at extreme networks

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,199
this is his second time presenting at

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,920
nanog and we're very happy to have him

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
speaking to us

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,640
michael there it is

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
all right good afternoon

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,559
so

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
uh

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,600
everything is moving to the cloud and

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,480
basically your network is is no

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,039
expectation no no exception in that

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,399
sense

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,360
so

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,079
one key thing i i kind of believe based

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,559
on the previous uh presentation is that

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,879
that you know 5g

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,438
is the first cloud native

25
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,240
mobile technology generation

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,200
and

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
looking at that 5g is much more than

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,360
just radio and core it's things like

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,479
like

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,880
management orchestration

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,920
you know

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,640
software defined networking

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,680
uh it is things like like policy driven

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,400
ai and ml

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,960
and transport

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,759
so

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,600
i'm going to spend the next 30 minutes

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,759
kind of talking through the same uh

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,439
kind of of

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,880
you know topic as the previous

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,280
presentation i think for people who

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,000
actually are not that

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
into the 5g part the transport part

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,560
i think it was a

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,479
quite deep dive the previous

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
presentation by igor

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,600
so i'm going to touch on on quite a lot

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,240
of the same things that igor touched on

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,960
but i'm going to try to actually you

50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,000
know

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,399
simplify a bit of things and and

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,440
pinpoint you know this more from a a

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
network point of view

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,800
and

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
with that said uh let's move into to

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
kind of

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,920
going through these things so

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
how i want to start this is

59
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,599
i said

60
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,120
more like like

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,239
you know uh building up or or or

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,560
building up the picture for you here i

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
think ego touched on on you know the

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
previous generations

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,879
being the 2g 3g lte

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,879
compared to 5g

67
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
but i wanna i want to start this with we

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,920
truly compare those two because there is

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,319
a huge difference

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,280
in the transport network requirements as

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,360
i get guess that many of you guys kind

72
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,959
of have realized based on the previous

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,560
presentation

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,599
so

75
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
if you look at 4g

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,400
you know

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,959
4g is one key service

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,239
it's one shared transport network

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,080
it is best effort and it's basically you

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,959
know latency is not that critical

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,879
then you go into the things like the

82
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,720
point-to-point backhaul so for 4g you

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,120
are actually using lead to point to

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,000
point backhaul carrier ethernet is

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,159
completely fine for that

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,879
and then you have a simple a single run

87
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,599
architecture basically for that one

88
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,560
so

89
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,400
looking at 5g

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,280
first of all 5g is

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,959
service average service driven

92
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,319
architecture

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,959
which basically means that you have

94
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,680
four things predefined

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,959
run is one thing 5g core is the second

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,840
thing

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,200
the hyperscalers is the third thing

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,640
and the fourth thing is transport

99
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
and obviously as i said i'm going to

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,519
touch on the transport part more on the

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,720
network

102
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,959
side of it

103
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,799
in addition to that one on the previous

104
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,319
presentation you heard about network

105
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,840
slicing isolation how would you be able

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,000
to actually have to say the same network

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,040
providing

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,560
multiple different isolated slice slices

109
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,199
for different services

110
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,240
so you truly go into different you know

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,040
slicing mechanism splicing types you

112
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,440
have a you know

113
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,759
service slice or the service instance

114
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,040
layer you have your resource instance

115
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,919
layer

116
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,440
and then you have your network instance

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,639
layer

118
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,280
so as you can see it started to build up

119
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,360
the the picture here of

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,639
5g

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
5g being far more complex than than the

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,320
previous generations

123
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
so then you go into i said hand in hand

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,199
with network slicing you have things

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,320
like like multiple different

126
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,400
applications consumer based you know it

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,039
could be the enterprise based things

128
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,520
so you start to look at that

129
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,840
traffic classes could be best for

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
traffic

131
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,400
could be you know

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
things like like the enhanced mobile

133
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,880
broadband which basically bandwidth is

134
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
the key requirement for that one

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,440
or it could be low latency applications

136
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,360
where you probably have heard of the the

137
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
kind of you know

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,360
so many times used

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
use case for that one which is

140
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
autonomous cars

141
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,880
which basically means that it's truly

142
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,960
latency sensitive

143
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,800
and that's kind of referred to as the

144
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,479
url

145
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,600
you know

146
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
use case

147
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,320
now

148
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
with that you start to look at actually

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,759
having

150
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,680
traffic within an area or region being

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,960
cu to cu communication

152
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,919
and then as we heard in the previous uh

153
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,960
presentation you start to actually move

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,360
the routing boundary more out towards

155
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,960
the edge

156
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,120
which basically means that that instead

157
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,440
of with 4g and the previous generations

158
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,759
where you actually had point-to-point

159
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,960
backhaul

160
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,600
now you start to move into

161
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,199
you know a dynamic

162
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,080
multi-destination

163
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,039
connectivity type for the x-hole part

164
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,120
here

165
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,639
then you actually have multiple run

166
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,280
architectures in the previous uh

167
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,360
presentation

168
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
it was not really covered you know the

169
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,400
different trend architectures that you

170
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,600
have there

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,199
and then

172
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,360
you start to virtualize things so you

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
virtualize your core

174
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
and then you have your control plane and

175
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,400
user plane is virtualized

176
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,679
in the previous presentation

177
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,240
he was igor was touching on on the ceo

178
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,120
and the du part the cu part being

179
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,000
basically the control plane and the user

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,039
plane

181
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,080
while the du part is actually then the

182
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,680
latency sensitive radio functions

183
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
and as i said if you start to virtualize

184
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
those that means that you actually move

185
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
them out from

186
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,039
the the specific purpose-built hardware

187
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,680
so these two to kind of set the stage

188
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
here for for what i'm going to to

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,080
basically talk about here the next 20

190
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,800
minutes or so

191
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,280
so looking at the different uh

192
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,120
network architectures

193
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,680
so overran was kind of discussed in the

194
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,520
previous presentation as well

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,759
overrun is not an architecture per se

196
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,080
it's more like the the

197
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,639
you know the definition of how you would

198
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,120
then uh

199
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,240
use uh multiple vendors equipment

200
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,360
to build a radio network so i'm going to

201
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,080
touch on on the distributed run

202
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
this is as as was kind of pinpointed in

203
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,560
the previous presentation as well the d

204
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,680
run is the traditionally integrated base

205
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
station with backhoe connection to the

206
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,720
first part of aggregation there

207
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
then you go into the centralized tran

208
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
which is basically an architecture in

209
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
which the base station is split into two

210
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,639
parts

211
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,639
the base band unit

212
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,120
and the radio head

213
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,000
now

214
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,879
continuing on that path then you have

215
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,319
the virtualized ran the vran or cloud

216
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,960
run whatever you want to call it

217
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,479
which is basically an evolution of the

218
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,880
centralized track

219
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,958
which basically consists of a

220
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,919
centralized pool of the baseband units

221
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,919
and virtualizing the the run control

222
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,360
functions and service delivery

223
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
so with the virtual run the base plan

224
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,440
modules is actually moved away from the

225
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,480
base station to the data center

226
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
which now means that now you start to

227
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,120
actually run those functions

228
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,880
on computes

229
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,640
so you virtualize everything

230
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,080
so is your network report prepared for

231
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
5g transport

232
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
i'm going to kind of ignore the the

233
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
upper part of this slide

234
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,160
where you talk about the the different

235
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,640
bands you know you have the millimeter

236
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
wave you have to see bands things like

237
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,760
that

238
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,279
and instead

239
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,760
kind of pinpoint the the transport

240
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,800
requirements and the technologies i

241
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
think the technologies became pretty

242
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,200
clear in the previous presentation

243
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,760
but the transport requirements from a

244
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
capacity interface and swing point of

245
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,279
view

246
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,080
so so looking at capacity you know the

247
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,160
previous generations actually as you can

248
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,040
see you had a few hundred migs capacity

249
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
need for that one

250
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
now with 5g you actually go into you

251
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,519
know 20 gig or also capacity need

252
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,959
and this goes back to my previous

253
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,440
statement saying that okay if i'm going

254
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,399
to go from purpose-built hardware

255
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,440
into running those functions on computes

256
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,760
that's obviously going to put a demand

257
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,600
on more capacity

258
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
in addition to that which is pretty

259
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,480
clear is that obviously you need to have

260
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,200
you know the the interfaces on your

261
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,480
computes is going to move into like

262
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,000
2 times 10 or even 25 gig on the compute

263
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,959
side

264
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,040
to be able to cope with those functions

265
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,519
running on computes

266
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,320
and then as we heard you go into the you

267
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,279
know background the frontal part

268
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,480
moving from from cpr into c e c p and

269
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,560
things like that

270
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,519
and multiple you know run architectures

271
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,560
as as

272
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,959
previously kind of of you know i alluded

273
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,920
so

274
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,640
this is a pretty busy slide but if if

275
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
you now look at the you know upper part

276
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,560
of this slide

277
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,519
it clearly shows that you go from a

278
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,560
radio head and your baseband unit into

279
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,040
virtualizing those in 5g so you have

280
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,839
your virtualized du and ceu

281
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,040
which is

282
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
as said the series the control plane the

283
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,839
user plane the du is

284
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
the virtualized you know latency

285
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,360
sensitive radio functions

286
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,519
so truly looking at the lower part of of

287
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,839
this you know illustration

288
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,959
you see clearly the 4g part which was

289
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,720
touched on on the pre in the previous

290
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,079
presentation

291
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,800
your back hole and your front hole

292
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,440
front hole being tdm because it's secret

293
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,720
traffic

294
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,560
while now on the 5g model you start to

295
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,720
look into the mid hole and the back hole

296
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,680
part

297
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,600
which truly have the requirements of

298
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,839
dynamic multi-point connectivity

299
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,839
compared to the 4g model where you

300
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,839
actually point to point connectivity

301
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,639
based only to carrier ethernet

302
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
and then on the front hall side you

303
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,079
start to move into a packet based based

304
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:02,800
uh

305
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,320
infrastructure data due to the fact that

306
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
you have easy pre-running which we heard

307
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,959
is a packet based technology

308
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,680
as well as the radio or ethernet there

309
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,440
so that on a kind of high level

310
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,720
to set

311
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,440
you know the foundation for for

312
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,160
this talk going further so

313
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,880
the crown part or or the virtualized

314
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,760
trend or the cloud run

315
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,720
now

316
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,399
i've been kind of alluding to the fact

317
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,399
that that you start to virtualize things

318
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,880
so if we think back like a couple of

319
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,240
years

320
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,920
it would have been pretty unlikely for

321
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,440
service providers to actually think

322
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,760
about you know virtualizing their

323
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
networks

324
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
so 5g came with force

325
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,040
and with 5g came actually new demands

326
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,160
for for more flexible architectures

327
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,440
as well as designs and and deployments

328
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,360
and more scale

329
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,160
as i have kind of been alluding to in my

330
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
previous slides here

331
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,200
so so with that in mind and when you now

332
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,320
start to virtualize those functions what

333
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,040
you actually see in this illustration is

334
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,600
a hub and spoke model

335
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,560
where

336
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,000
in the spoke you have your your radios

337
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
so be it a light bulb you know a light

338
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,680
sorry a a you know radio sitting on a a

339
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,639
macro site sitting in in any kind of a

340
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,760
site we do understand that with 5g you

341
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,000
get into much higher density from a

342
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
radio point of view

343
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,880
so so ignoring for now the frontal part

344
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,519
which is packet based easy as we learned

345
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,360
in the previous presentation

346
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,079
looking at the hub site in the hub site

347
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,480
you now start to see some kind of a data

348
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
center fabric

349
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
and that data center fabric depending on

350
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,360
if you talk about the deep edge the edge

351
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,639
could be of various sizes it could be a

352
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,839
small you know two node fabric

353
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,839
or it could be as you can see in the

354
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,639
illustration here a

355
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,519
three-stage claw architecture spineleaf

356
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,040
architecture

357
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,279
running things like like you know bgp on

358
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,839
the ip underlay together with evp and vx

359
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,360
and on the overlay

360
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
to connect the computes

361
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
as we previously kind of learned that

362
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,079
that the computes are now going to to

363
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,440
host your ceo and the du functions

364
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,920
running you know on on

365
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,279
kind of generic compute platforms

366
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,440
and now you start to look at actually

367
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,079
moving the 5g radio functions

368
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,279
into

369
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,639
using computes which is you know cuts

370
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,720
hardware with some kind of aggregators

371
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,440
in addition to that you now run those

372
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,199
kind of 5g

373
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,000
or those run functions

374
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,160
on on

375
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,639
microservices running on on containers

376
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,959
on bare metal servers

377
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,720
you start to utilize you know cloud

378
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,279
native technologies like kubernetes for

379
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,720
that one

380
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,519
and then you know adapt to devops

381
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,000
principles for that one

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,760
and now the key thing is that you also

383
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,839
talk about life cycle my end-to-end life

384
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,480
cycle management here which is then

385
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,680
basically going to be not only for for

386
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,240
your radio part but also your transport

387
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
part meaning you know things like

388
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,759
management orchestration automation all

389
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,680
those different things

390
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,880
hitting truly the run and the transport

391
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,199
part of that

392
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,920
so so this to kind of build an overall

393
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,240
picture of you know

394
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
as i mentioned on my

395
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,199
kind of first slide that that 5g is

396
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,519
going to be a huge

397
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,399
you know

398
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,560
have a huge difference to the previous

399
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,320
generations of

400
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
the mobile networks in regards to the

401
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,000
transport part there

402
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,959
we kind of heard in the previous uh

403
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,959
presentation about this one as well the

404
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,839
sales side gateways which actually start

405
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,639
the modulatory boundary more towards the

406
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,680
edge due to the network slicing things

407
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,759
and due to the fact that you start to

408
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,320
isolate different services

409
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,279
based on the service types

410
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,000
so

411
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,279
this is more or less a kind of recap of

412
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,680
the previous presentation as well but

413
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,000
anyway i want to kind of mention this

414
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,680
you have different use cases

415
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,000
applications defined for 5g

416
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,800
hence you had a network slicing and and

417
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,120
you have used cases like like

418
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,680
the enhanced mobile broadband which is

419
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,680
an sd van like use case or application

420
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,079
where you basically need bandwidth right

421
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,519
it's it's not latency sensitive as such

422
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,759
then you have the urlc

423
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,480
use case which you know using the kind

424
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,959
of famous example for that one is the

425
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,799
autonomous driving

426
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,199
and that is obviously latency sensitive

427
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,919
so now you start to to see traffic that

428
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,199
might be within an area or region

429
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,520
mean that you basically have now traffic

430
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,319
you know going within an edge data

431
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,359
center could be cu to cu communication

432
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,160
there

433
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
that's why you start to see now you know

434
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,280
the demand for for

435
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,720
multi-destination connectivity for 5g

436
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,559
and then you have things like industry

437
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,559
40 iot

438
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,160
obviously having things like like

439
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,880
security in mind qos so on and so forth

440
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,919
so clearly you can see that you have

441
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,480
different applications use cases having

442
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,080
different demand

443
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,600
based on on what they are

444
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,400
so

445
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,720
kind of picking on the previous use case

446
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
for

447
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,799
urlc where you know you talk about

448
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,480
latency

449
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,799
so obviously as we heard in the previous

450
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,520
presentation as well ptp is kind of of

451
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,760
one of the key factors that your network

452
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,039
do need to support going forward for 5g

453
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,640
transport

454
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
so just to recap what is ptp

455
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,320
it's a protocol for distributing precise

456
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,200
time and frequency over packet networks

457
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,160
defined in the ieee standards the first

458
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,679
kind of version

459
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,799
was released back in 2002 which targeted

460
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,679
the lan applications the second version

461
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,240
was actually released 2008

462
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,679
which kind of brought the telecom

463
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,679
network into the picture

464
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,360
and there is a third version under

465
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,960
discussion as we kind of heard in the

466
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,600
previous presentation as well

467
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,679
so so in a nutshell with ptp time is

468
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,480
carried in event messages

469
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,120
and these event messages are transmitted

470
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,640
from the the

471
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,120
grand master clock to the slave clocks

472
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,440
we kind of heard about the ptp you know

473
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,280
here in the previous presentation as

474
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
well

475
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,799
it runs over even uh ethernet and ip

476
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,039
and

477
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,880
you basically have

478
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
two different flavors of this

479
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,480
you have the archipelago 2.1 cm

480
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,200
which is aimed towards i said the

481
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,600
carrier word and then you have d802.1 ba

482
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,480
which is more aimed towards abb and

483
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
industry automation

484
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,240
obviously both of these falls under the

485
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,080
tsa umbrella defined in the 82.20 queue

486
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,160
which basically defines

487
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,640
deterministic messaging over ethernet

488
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,799
networks

489
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,679
and

490
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,919
we kind of heard about you know the the

491
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,919
telco part here with things like clock

492
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,520
preemption

493
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,840
which allows you to blend the ethernet

494
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,480
traffic and see pretty easy free traffic

495
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,880
we also heard about the radio ethernet

496
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,840
which is a way of

497
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,600
the secret traffic into ethernet

498
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
so

499
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,320
going into the profiles these profiles

500
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,600
were discussed in the previous

501
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,080
presentation as well but i just want to

502
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,200
recap this because they are kind of

503
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,919
important so so

504
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,520
in short back in in 2008

505
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,200
when you basically had the first ptp

506
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
version defined for the telecovered you

507
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
also had the first ptp profile defined

508
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,760
which was referred to as the

509
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,400
8265.1

510
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,960
which defined the support for frequency

511
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,640
synchronization over the telecom

512
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,320
networks and obviously it was used for

513
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,360
for

514
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,480
the the

515
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,760
cell base station synchronization

516
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,480
now

517
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
going forward as we heard you have two

518
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
new profiles

519
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,000
you have the g8275 one which is the full

520
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,880
timing support and the 8275.2 which is

521
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,679
the partial timing support

522
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,799
and

523
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,520
as we heard in the previous presentation

524
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
there is a main difference between those

525
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,880
ones now

526
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,120
the

527
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,200
8275-1 the full time in support do

528
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,400
require boundary clock at every node

529
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,559
within your network

530
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,880
each node within your network needs to

531
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,360
actually have ptp support supporting

532
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,600
boundary clocks

533
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,760
and obviously the intent with this one

534
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
is that you reduce the timer

535
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,440
accumulation accumulation through the

536
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,280
network

537
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,320
uh

538
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,159
we heard about it it's

539
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,200
you know

540
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,559
recommends the use of synchronous

541
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,120
internet for synchronizing the boundary

542
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
clock to stable frequency

543
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
and

544
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,280
it operates only to ethernet networks

545
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,840
and supports multiple active ground

546
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,159
monsters for redundancy

547
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,960
the second one which was touched on as

548
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
well is the for the partial timing

549
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
support

550
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,440
and

551
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,919
the intent of this profile is obvious to

552
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,440
be able to support current networks not

553
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
everybody have the luxury of greenfield

554
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,240
installs so you need to support current

555
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,520
you know infrastructure you have in

556
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,640
place to be able to actually provide you

557
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,520
know the frequency time and phase

558
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,360
synchronization of those networks

559
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,159
so the key features of the the you know

560
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,720
the apache time support profile is it

561
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,320
operates our existing switches and

562
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,240
routers using

563
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,840
unicast ip

564
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,159
it uses boundary and transpo transparent

565
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,640
clocks where necessary

566
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,960
and then supports multiple active grand

567
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,320
masters

568
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,640
for redundancy as

569
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,159
the previous 8275.1 profile as well

570
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,480
so

571
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,200
to put this into some contexts i don't

572
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,039
think this was kind of

573
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,960
went true as such in the previous

574
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,720
presentation but

575
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,080
to kind of

576
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,120
explain the illustration here it's quite

577
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,200
clear that you need to have

578
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,520
some kind of sync between your base

579
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
station and your grand master and then

580
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,720
ptp is kind of a mechanism to be able to

581
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,000
do that

582
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,919
what you can see in this illustration is

583
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,520
basically that you have your grand

584
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
master clock

585
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,440
which is a boundary clock

586
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,679
responsible for generating the ptp

587
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,600
packet which is then going to be

588
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
obviously transported over your network

589
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,000
or all the way over to each and every

590
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
base station or sales site

591
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,559
which means that you basically have a

592
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,200
path for each and every sales

593
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,679
each and every base station here to your

594
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,120
network

595
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,440
in addition to that one the the grand

596
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
master clock is going to derive its

597
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,799
referencing from from a gns satellite in

598
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,880
this example as we kind of heard in the

599
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,520
previous presentation as well

600
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,480
so

601
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,880
on a higher level this is actually how

602
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,559
how you kind of start to look at this

603
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,039
one from a ptp point of view

604
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,279
now

605
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,240
as we heard in the previous presentation

606
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,799
as well you have kind of the magic

607
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,120
number of three microseconds

608
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
this is the

609
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,159
3 gpp

610
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,480
defined t a e stands for the total uh

611
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,440
for for the the

612
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,640
alignment error the the uh

613
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,440
which is a relative measurement

614
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,480
so

615
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,520
what happens here is so so sorry so the

616
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,159
ta is tae stands for the timing

617
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,840
alignment error

618
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,960
which basically means that

619
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,520
how it's defined is that you

620
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,880
have actually three microseconds

621
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,120
uh tae between any two ru's

622
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,159
so

623
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,159
that basically means that

624
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,120
between any ru and your time in grand

625
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,679
master you basically have the 1.5

626
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,200
microsecond as your tae defined

627
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,080
now

628
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,480
that more complex into this you have

629
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
things like the the coordinated

630
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,960
multipoint which obviously goes hand in

631
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,600
hand with the fact that 5g

632
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,880
is is going to have high density of of

633
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,559
you know the the

634
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,880
cell sites installed so you basically

635
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,360
have you know the same network to

636
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,279
provide connectivity for for many many

637
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,279
base stations

638
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,799
so it's fair to say that that you know

639
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,960
accurate timing is no longer nice to

640
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,799
have it is truly required

641
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,640
and

642
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,840
testing timing is a large new you know

643
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,320
challenge for the csps how would you

644
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,799
test things like this as we are talking

645
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,440
about you know the three microseconds

646
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,039
and then 1.5 microsecond here

647
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,600
as the figures

648
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,840
so

649
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,400
there is a

650
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
mechanism in place for that one so so

651
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
you have a couple of key factors for

652
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,240
accurate synchronization

653
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,520
so

654
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,880
the factors that make the

655
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,120
synchronization poor are actually to you

656
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,880
have the dte and the cte so the dt

657
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,279
stands for the dynamic and the ct stands

658
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,640
for the the

659
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,840
constant

660
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,799
now the ct is the ptp packet latency

661
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,240
asymmetry

662
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,039
while the dt is the ptp packet latency

663
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,200
variation

664
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,080
so the illustration you can see there is

665
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,679
is basically a recap of what we were

666
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,279
where are we making the statement saying

667
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,799
that 1.1 microsecond is

668
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,840
your your total

669
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,799
tae within your network

670
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,840
so how comes 1.1 due to the fact that

671
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,520
you had 400 nanoseconds which add in the

672
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,720
over air so from a network point of view

673
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,520
your ta is 1.1 microseconds

674
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,360
so

675
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,240
how is this then then kind of dealt with

676
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,080
so i was mentioning when we talked about

677
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,399
ptp that you have your your event

678
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,679
message

679
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,399
so think of the event message being your

680
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,960
your the event message is the packet

681
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,080
flow you know or the packet timing

682
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,559
signaling and this is obviously then

683
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,039
derived from the fact that you start to

684
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,000
look at or compare your your you know t1

685
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,720
and t2 so your your timestamps t1 and t2

686
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,480
and then basically synchronize

687
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,039
accordingly based on those timestamps

688
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,600
within your ptp event message

689
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,520
so

690
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,279
this is an example of how you actually

691
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,440
build this up then

692
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,399
so

693
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,279
you have your 1.1 microseconds which is

694
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,799
the network-wide and then you have 1.5

695
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,200
which is you know from an end station's

696
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
point of view

697
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,320
so

698
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,000
the

699
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,559
how this builds up is that

700
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,799
you introduce your prtc or your timing

701
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,600
ground master which is then going to add

702
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,159
some kind of a

703
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,559
timing error due to the faith due to the

704
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,720
fact that it's going to place you know

705
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,279
the packet in or placing the time in a

706
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,880
packet

707
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,039
then you go into your network part which

708
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,120
is based on on the dt and the city part

709
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,600
the dynamic comes from you know the

710
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,159
random error due to sync ethernet for

711
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,080
instance and then your city the constant

712
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,559
is based on your network elements based

713
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,640
on your switches

714
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,240
that as we heard in the previous

715
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,559
presentation you have different classes

716
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,799
you have class a b and c

717
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,799
and those are going to introduce

718
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,880
different levels of timing alignment

719
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,320
errors

720
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,760
and then you have your link asymmetry um

721
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,000
delays which is basically your your

722
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,399
link delay link latency here

723
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,039
so this is from a network point of view

724
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,440
how you would measure this then

725
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,159
and then i said you get into your your

726
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,720
end application noise here

727
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,399
to basically have the 1.5 being your

728
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,799
your you know total that you have to

729
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,279
deal with

730
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,120
so

731
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,240
this was kind of a a pretty fast walk

732
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,320
through on on transport network

733
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,200
requirements obviously didn't touch on

734
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,039
on all of those

735
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,440
just more or less wanted to pinpoint a

736
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,120
few things that you need to take into

737
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,880
consideration when you start to build

738
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,240
these transport networks

739
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,919
so on that note this kind of concludes

740
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,760
my presentation

741
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,720
any questions

742
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,280
okay thank you

743
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,920
