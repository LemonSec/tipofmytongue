00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,520
hello my name is jill bender i am a

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,160
software engineer currently working on a

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,400
distributed storage solution

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,320
and throughout my many years of hiring

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,720
for technical roles i have gained some

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
practical and research-backed strategies

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,400
for helping you increase the diversity

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,359
of your technical hiring pipelines

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,039
today i will discuss the following

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,560
topics

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
first i will answer a common question

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,880
about inclusive hiring

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,200
why why should you care

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,079
second i will define what an effective

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,079
job description should do for your

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
technical roles

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,559
then we'll discuss some common problems

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,920
with job descriptions and their impacts

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,600
and then last i'll provide you with some

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
tools so that you can start improving

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,920
your own job descriptions today

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,640
so why should you care

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,719
let's start with the reason why you

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,079
should make a change in your job

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,520
advertisements

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,440
the people in this group work on one of

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,840
the world's most important systems that

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,080
connect people all over the world

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,159
we as technologists are solving hard

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,680
problems for the future benefit of

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
society at large

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,200
with that in mind

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,799
let's start with a business case for

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,920
diversity

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960
first to stay competitive in this ever

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,200
changing tech landscape businesses

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,960
constantly need to innovate

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,600
innovation requires non-linear novel

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
thinking and adaptability and hiring

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,520
people that can bring a new perspective

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
to a problem helps us innovate

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
second there are plenty of studies that

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
show diverse teams that have a focus on

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,320
inclusion see an increase in performance

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
and with all that in mind diversity in

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,240
companies is also associated with

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,799
increased revenue more customers all

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,799
those great things

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,920
however

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,240
even though this research is clear it's

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,479
also important to note that solely

53
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,920
increasing the numbers of

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,520
underrepresented people in your

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,399
workforce does not automatically produce

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,119
benefits you can't just take and add

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,119
diversity and stir approach while

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,679
business continues as usual in order to

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,920
see these gains in effectiveness or

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,080
financial performance there may be

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
underlying cultural issues that are

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
hindering innovation and performance

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,640
fundamentally you need to choose to

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,959
improve diversity because it's the right

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,000
thing to do

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and you need to grow your organization's

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,920
culture along with the changes in your

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,680
hiring process

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
why am i here

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,640
i'm here in large part due to my father

71
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
my dad robert bender has worked for

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,080
decades as a network operations manager

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
my dad brought me to my first nanog when

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,120
i was in high school in 2008 which

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
helped me to pursue my career in

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
computing

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
it was inspiring for me to meet so many

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,879
talented engineers and technologists

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
when i graduated i started on my first

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,280
full-time engineering position where i

81
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,519
was one of only a few female engineers

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,519
and a team of 300.

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,200
this is a picture of my first

84
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,959
engineering team

85
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,280
this is a group of incredibly talented

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,080
people who in so many ways

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,840
helped me lay a solid technical

88
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,480
foundation for where i am today

89
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,080
but i was starting to feel the effects

90
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,599
of isolation at work here you can see a

91
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,280
comment from my aunt on facebook and i

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
posted this photo

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,519
she said there are no other women in

94
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,720
those photos that is freaky

95
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,360
and i went to my manager

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
at the time and asked

97
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,480
why don't we have more women on our team

98
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,080
he explained to me that he just wasn't

99
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,400
seeing women apply for the positions it

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
wasn't that he didn't want to hire them

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,840
it's that he wasn't even getting any

102
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,159
applications in his inbox it was then

103
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,319
that we started implementing some simple

104
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,720
changes that i'll share with you today

105
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
to improve gender and racial diversity

106
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
on our team

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,560
so what's the problem now that we

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
understand why you should care about

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
improving diversity of your hiring

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,640
pipeline let's dive into one

111
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
simple place where you can start to make

112
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,959
a change in your workplace

113
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,120
this diagram outlines the

114
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,799
leaky pipeline

115
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,120
i often hear managers

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,639
like my manager

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,160
that the reason they can't hire a

118
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
diverse team is due to the pipeline

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,279
problem

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
that there simply aren't enough women or

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
people of color in their hiring pools

122
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,000
while this certainly is true and

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,560
deserves continued work for k-12 and

124
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,240
college programs there are many

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,759
actionable steps

126
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,280
that you can take today to at least

127
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,440
ensure that your hiring pipeline is

128
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,800
representative of the tech industry's

129
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,960
population at large

130
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,720
there are highly qualified candidates

131
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,199
out there and we are here to learn why

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
they may not be applying for your jobs

133
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,560
on to effective job descriptions

134
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,240
one of the first steps in hiring

135
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
pipelines is the job description

136
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,120
what is the purpose of a job description

137
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
first of all

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,199
it is

139
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
not to scare people off you may want to

140
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,800
welcome in

141
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
as many qualified candidates as possible

142
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,759
while still keeping your applications at

143
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,479
a reasonable number to sift through in

144
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,240
my team recruiters were telling us that

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
they didn't have enough candidates from

146
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
underrepresented groups applying we were

147
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,320
actually hindering ourselves by treating

148
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,400
this job description as a weeding out

149
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
tool instead of a welcoming tool to

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,320
bring in as many qualified candidates as

151
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,520
possible

152
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,400
and these weeding out tools really what

153
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
they do is they maintain a status quo

154
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,560
using

155
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
a coded language

156
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
so when you're using gendered words in a

157
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
job advertisement maybe not

158
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
intentionally

159
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
it actually prevents a level playing

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,520
field for all who are looking at your

161
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,560
position

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,919
imagine

163
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
the face of a person

164
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,479
when i say the following titles

165
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,080
lawyer

166
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,520
nurse

167
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,120
doctor

168
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
teacher

169
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,919
engineer

170
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,560
you may have a specific gender of a

171
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,520
person in mind when i said those names

172
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
even though gender jobs are generally on

173
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
the decline

174
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,039
a careless language use

175
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,120
might cause organizations and companies

176
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,360
to miss out on well-qualified applicants

177
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
for these positions

178
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,440
so the question is can we write better

179
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,639
ads

180
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,880
yes you definitely can

181
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,199
we are creating the future and we need a

182
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,280
diverse representation to create a

183
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,039
diverse tomorrow

184
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,520
environmental cues such as demographics

185
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,600
the makeup of a room and gendered

186
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,759
wording can subtly cue that one does not

187
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,880
belong

188
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
but how do we spot this gender wording

189
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,160
and advertisements uh don't worry i'm

190
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
here to give you some examples

191
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,360
what you want to do when you're

192
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,639
approaching

193
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,639
writing a job description or maybe

194
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,080
taking an old job description that your

195
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,440
organization has

196
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
and you're trying to improve or maybe

197
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,759
put it out for a new position is to

198
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,199
deliberately

199
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,280
add language that appeals to women and

200
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
under underrepresented groups

201
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,639
instead of using stereotypical masculine

202
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,080
words like

203
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
guru or hacker or ninja

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
i don't think that

205
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,520
really any of us

206
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,360
in the industry think of ourselves as a

207
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
ninja it might just be some clever

208
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,280
marketing copy that somebody came up

209
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
with at one point that people think will

210
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
be appealing but it's actually not

211
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
so here are some specific examples

212
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
of gendered wording and job ads with

213
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,199
some suggestions for what to use instead

214
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,919
so

215
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,840
it's very common for words like tackle

216
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,199
or

217
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,800
dominant or strong or

218
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,280
expert to come up in

219
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,479
job ads

220
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,800
personally my least favorite is rockstar

221
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
it comes up all the time in software

222
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,440
positions

223
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
and as soon as i see that i kind of run

224
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,919
the other direction then i don't really

225
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,160
want to apply for that job

226
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
so other things that you can include

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,879
instead

228
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,400
might be phrases like collaboration

229
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,280
or um striving for or an impact

230
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
something that will have meaning

231
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,919
um

232
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,680
building emotional awareness like

233
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,560
empathy or thinking about what that team

234
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
environment is going to be like and use

235
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,039
welcoming words like

236
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
join us or

237
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,960
even welcome

238
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,280
that way more people will want to

239
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,599
apply for your positions

240
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,720
now that's not to say that i as a woman

241
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,599
can't

242
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,000
be those things but we're also dealing

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,919
with stereotypes here

244
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
so just try to include more

245
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,279
balanced language if not just index over

246
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,958
onto the

247
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,799
typically more feminine coded words or

248
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,719
more neutral words

249
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,159
and you'll see

250
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,720
quite an impact in the applicant pool

251
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,800
that you have for your job postings it's

252
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,600
been shown by research that

253
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
excluding that stereotypically male

254
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,399
language does not actually change

255
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,360
men's

256
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,760
desire to apply for a job but it

257
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,080
definitely does turn women away from

258
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,000
applying to your position

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
so another strategy you can do besides

260
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,080
just looking at specific words is

261
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,839
looking at phrasing and intent behind

262
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,120
your message

263
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,600
so try to use friendly and welcoming

264
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,640
language

265
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
for example

266
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
here are some real

267
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
snippets from real job postings for

268
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,519
software engineers

269
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,080
so let's dig into each of these examples

270
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
and why they might be problematic

271
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
first we have

272
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,440
change the world or go home

273
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,760
not exactly the most welcoming language

274
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,920
to invite candidates to apply

275
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,040
instead

276
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,360
use a call to join your team something a

277
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,880
little bit more welcoming a little more

278
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,120
friendly

279
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,080
second we have a hyperbolic example that

280
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,920
is trying to make an opportunity sound

281
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
challenging now

282
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
i'm an engineer

283
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
i love problem solving but i want to

284
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
solve the fun kind of problems and not

285
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,440
get stuck in a bad situation

286
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,880
so instead mention the impact that

287
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
somebody might have in your role

288
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
and then in this last example

289
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,519
it's telling someone that the job isn't

290
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,160
right for them i would recommend not

291
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,680
telling a candidate what they can or

292
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,839
can't do let them make that decision for

293
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,079
themselves instead describe

294
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,320
what your teen culture is like maybe say

295
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,000
it's open-ended and describe your

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,959
day-to-day atmosphere hp

297
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,120
did a research study that's pretty well

298
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,839
quoted what they found is that for their

299
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:24,959
positions

300
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,959
women were only applying to jobs if they

301
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,640
met 90 to 100 of the requirements listed

302
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,279
in a job posting the more bullet points

303
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,200
that you add to your requirements in a

304
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,360
job posting the more you could be

305
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,279
unintentionally weeding out qualified

306
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,279
candidates for your job

307
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,120
so with this in mind

308
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,399
one question

309
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,000
that you should ask yourself when you're

310
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,760
writing your job postings

311
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,880
is

312
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,399
is that really

313
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,880
a requirement and yes you should ask

314
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,920
yourself

315
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,480
this question about every requirement

316
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,040
that you have on your job posting

317
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,680
every one of those bullet point items

318
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,399
may be perceived as a checklist

319
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,760
some candidates

320
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,600
will think that they need to check all

321
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,920
of those boxes in order to apply

322
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,320
but often when you ask a hiring manager

323
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,640
that's not the case at all they just

324
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
listed qualities that they would want in

325
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,600
an ideal world and for many postings a

326
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,160
person just may not exist that can meet

327
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,880
that long list of criteria so watch

328
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,000
those bullet points when you're writing

329
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
your postings

330
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,519
another thing to ask yourself

331
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,279
is to challenge assumptions commonly

332
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,079
made

333
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,480
for example is it possible for somebody

334
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
without a college degree to learn this

335
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,200
skill

336
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,959
what might the equivalent experience be

337
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,320
for that role

338
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,480
so just keep in mind

339
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
some people will only apply to your

340
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,560
posting if they meet 90 to 100 of those

341
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
criteria so one way to help you reduce

342
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
the number of bullet points in your

343
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,320
posting

344
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,680
is to really think through the

345
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,560
requirements for your job i know that

346
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
when a new wreck comes up there's a huge

347
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
rush to get that posting out so you can

348
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
start sourcing candidates immediately

349
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
for your already understaffed team

350
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,839
but take a little bit of time

351
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
maybe do it before the posting goes up

352
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,440
so that you can start to reuse that

353
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,600
position over time and to really think

354
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,079
about some measurable criteria for that

355
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,120
position

356
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,600
many postings use the word strong as a

357
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,920
way to measure skills but really what

358
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,240
does what does strong python skills

359
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,639
actually mean to you is there a specific

360
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,000
coding question you want people to

361
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,320
answer is there a specific set of

362
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,839
knowledge about python you want them to

363
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,800
know

364
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
so is there a different way that you can

365
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,079
measure that

366
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,279
and when you consider your criteria

367
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,040
before your job is posting you actually

368
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,600
improve the quality of hires across the

369
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,160
board not just for a diverse hiring

370
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,639
the last thing that you want is for an

371
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,160
unqualified candidate to land in your

372
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,959
job

373
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,639
so really the last thing that you should

374
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,600
be doing

375
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
is lowering your hiring bar to improve

376
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,360
diversity you actually want to do the

377
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,279
opposite you want to make your criteria

378
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,399
measurable

379
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,320
and clear so it helps your team in

380
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,760
assessing a candidate that way you can

381
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,160
hold everybody to the same standard so

382
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
if you need someone who knows ipv6

383
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,880
say so in the job application make sure

384
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,639
your interviewers covet cover it in

385
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,920
their interviews

386
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
and it really helps everyone get on the

387
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,000
same page about what a quality candidate

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,480
is and it helps us reduce bias

389
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,560
in our decision making process

390
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,839
now another question that i always get

391
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,200
when i'm reviewing job postings for

392
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,440
other people is what about my nice to

393
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,639
haves

394
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,560
remember when people write job postings

395
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,000
they're thinking about an ideal

396
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,120
candidate

397
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,720
they have this picture in their mind of

398
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,560
somebody who can do it all do all the

399
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
things

400
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,519
but when somebody's reading your job

401
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,800
posting

402
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,880
those nice to haves even that in that

403
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,120
nice to have section they're also

404
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,199
perceived as requirements so if you

405
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,800
really want them

406
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,639
maybe just keep them privately don't

407
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,920
publish them

408
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,800
if you

409
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,680
absolutely have to have them

410
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,279
in your job description put them in a

411
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
paragraph format not in a bulleted

412
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,440
format now i said i would provide you

413
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
with some tools

414
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,680
so

415
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,839
i reviewed a lot of tips for improving

416
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,440
your job descriptions

417
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,959
and so i've provided you here with a

418
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,880
helpful checklist that you can use when

419
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
reviewing your postings

420
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,639
the first posting that you edit may take

421
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,120
you a while but once you've done one the

422
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,279
rest should take you a little less time

423
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,800
an investment of even an hour in

424
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
reviewing your job postings could make

425
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,279
all the difference so i have some tools

426
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,760
here to help you in your journey to go

427
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,199
through this checklist

428
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,880
make sure that you have those measurable

429
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,760
requirements in your job postings

430
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,399
and try to keep away from your nice to

431
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,360
haves

432
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,320
and limit those bullet points if you can

433
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,079
um obviously if it's a requirement for

434
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,600
the job you should keep it in there so

435
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,760
that you have a realistic posting for

436
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,000
what your job responsibilities will be

437
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,120
be friendly and welcoming use lots of we

438
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,800
and you statements

439
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,440
um avoid corporate cliches like synergy

440
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,279
definitely avoid the word guru or

441
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,199
rockstar

442
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,959
and a really important thing that you

443
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,399
can do

444
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,760
in order to encourage more people to

445
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,839
apply to your position is once you have

446
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,600
this posting ready

447
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,040
send it out to lots of people for

448
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,639
feedback send it to people from

449
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,560
different backgrounds for feedback on

450
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
this posting you don't have to do all

451
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,160
this editing on your own you can ask

452
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,000
other people for help

453
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,680
and then when it's ready when you feel

454
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
like you have a reasonable draft

455
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,920
send it out broadly as broadly as you

456
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,800
can put it on twitter send it out to

457
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
people who are maybe just on the fringes

458
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,920
of your network

459
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,000
and then you might get a wider

460
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,440
range of candidates applying to your

461
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,839
jobs other helpful tools that you can

462
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,560
use today that will give you a nice

463
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,399
visual editing experience for your job

464
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,759
postings

465
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,360
is um

466
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
things that will highlight maybe

467
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,839
problematic terms or help you understand

468
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,360
uh what language you're using in your

469
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,560
own postings there is a paid tool here

470
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
called textio

471
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
you can see an example where it

472
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,079
highlights the potentially masculine

473
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,240
wording it also tells you like to use

474
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
lots of verbs and an active voice in

475
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,720
your posting it will give you a score on

476
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,480
your job posting and they've they've got

477
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,839
data on lots of different job

478
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,920
descriptions that you can use um to your

479
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
advantage

480
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,880
however if you can't find budget for

481
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,560
that that's totally fine there are lots

482
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
of free tools out there that will help

483
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,279
you get a somewhat similar experience um

484
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,040
like the gender decoder

485
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,199
and the hemingway app these tools are

486
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,160
free

487
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,839
and they can help you identify phrases

488
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,720
to change in the visual editor

489
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,959
and like i mentioned another well-tested

490
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
way of improving your postings is to

491
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
share your job ad for feedback with lots

492
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,279
of different people that's also free and

493
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,839
probably provides you better results

494
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,040
so hopefully you find these tools

495
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,560
helpful as you start to edit your own

496
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,000
job postings

497
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,560
and in summary if you really only take

498
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,199
away three things from this presentation

499
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,000
um minimize your bullet points

500
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,800
avoid stereotypically masculine words

501
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,440
use like welcome well think welcoming

502
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,480
language

503
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,079
be friendly and lastly circulate your jd

504
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,760
broadly for review

505
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,839

descriptions

538
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,360

they are

540
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,520
helpful tips and not everyone uh who

541
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,280
gets fostered into management always

544
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,440
room uh please state your name and

546
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440

547
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,640
hi i'm uh brian fields um i'm i guess

548
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,000
with nokia

549
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,160
um i'm very actually happy that i

550
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,280
watched this

551
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,720
uh i was actually going to dip out and

552
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,640
not watch it because

553
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,320
bias i guess

554
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,480
but it was really good um one of the

555
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,520
things i want to bring up this is more

556
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,720
of a comment

557
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,520
and

558
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,039
i thought it might be something that

559
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,559
could be a talk at some point but um

560
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,960
i've noticed this a little bit with

561
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,760
uh

562
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,679
female engineers i've worked with

563
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,400
is

564
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,720
especially when it comes to

565
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,400
hey they've got the job everything's

566
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,440
good

567
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,320
um

568
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,840
they don't negotiate as aggressively or

569
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
maybe work well

570
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
negotiating

571
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,039
with uh

572
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,280
the hiring manager whoever

573
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,799
and i find that leaves money on the

574
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,720
table i mean a quintessential example of

575
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
this i have a good friend of mine

576
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,360
everything was good she got a job offer

577
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,840
and it was like 5 000 more than she was

578
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,880
making

579
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,080
and i said well

580
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
what did you put down she said well they

581
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,640
wanted the

582
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,799
the previous salary history and i gave

583
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,400
it to him

584
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,679
and i said

585
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,600
you're supposed to lie on that everybody

586
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,799
does that

587
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,200
i said they they can't verify that

588
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,080
and

589
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,039
you know

590
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,960
it's almost as if

591
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,840
our

592
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,760
educational institutions don't do

593
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,320
anything and don't teach people this is

594
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,679
probably some of the most important

595
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,360
stuff whether you

596
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,799
you know you're being hired as a python

597
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,799
program or a network engineer

598
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,919
is

599
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,280
if you're in the same ballpark it's

600
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
negotiable and i i don't know how to

601
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,080
you know that needs to be fleshed out a

602
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,039
little bit more but i think that's

603
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,559
something that that everybody can

604
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,679
benefit from and and women especially

605
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,240
yeah that that's an excellent comment um

606
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,559
one other recommendation that i have to

607
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,200
look at is changing the structure of

608
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,640
your

609
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,200
salary ranges for each position so based

610
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,080
on leveling requirements that you know

611
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,520
if you really think through those

612
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,000
requirements for your job postings

613
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,280
it can help throughout your entire

614
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,600
hiring pipeline and up through like

615
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,960
performance reviews if you know what

616
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,120
your criteria are for position

617
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,799
that will help you

618
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,679
all all the way across the board to help

619
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,520
assess

620
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
performance

621
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
in interviews and on the job

622
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,679
and

623
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,320
building a structure of maybe different

624
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,120
salary ranges for what you've assessed

625
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
that candidate as being can help

626
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,600
level the playing field a little bit and

627
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,720
say

628
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,600
everyone who is a senior in this role

629
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,360
gets a salary that's in this range

630
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,280
which can help reduce some of those

631
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
socialized things where

632
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,720
uh maybe it's uh less socialized for for

633
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,640
women to want to negotiate than maybe it

634
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,760
is for men

635
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,880
um

636
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,799
not that everyone shouldn't negotiate

637
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,080
because that's an excellent thing to do

638
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,159
thank you

639
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,840
thank you

640
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,520
we have a comment on a question online

641
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,919
another comment from matthew ptak great

642
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,159
follow on topic is reviewing resumes

643
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,880
with names blacked out to enjoy danger

644
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,799
or other biases on the part of the

645
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,039
reviewing committee

646
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,799
excellent comment

647
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,360
i would highly recommend doing that

648
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,960
there's lots of interesting research

649
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,240
about bias and decision making

650
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
as it comes to candidates as it comes to

651
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,840
even like technical decisions that we're

652
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,520
making

653
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,840
and anonymizing your resumes is a great

654
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,559
way to reduce bias

655
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,600
all right

656
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,159
okay um let's see i've got two more

657
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,360
questions online and one in the room so

658
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,400
the one online question first

659
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,799
this is from rhonda silva can you share

660
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,640
your thoughts on stem and how this

661
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,360
community can help impact girls and

662
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,919
women in particular getting into this

663
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,600
field to increase diversity in the

664
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,679
pipeline

665
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,400
absolutely um i

666
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,799
was in switching rooms with my dad

667
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,120
growing up and so i am uniquely

668
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,320
have always been interested in

669
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
technology and have had the exposure to

670
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,400
that but not everybody has that there

671
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
are some awesome organizations out there

672
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,120
helping to get exposure

673
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
for programming girls who code is a

674
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,000
great organization um to support but

675
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,280
also just

676
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,799
mentoring people in your community

677
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,120
getting involved

678
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
and giving a presentation to local

679
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,600
schools maybe reaching out

680
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,320
to some school districts that you know

681
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,400
that are in maybe lower income areas to

682
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
help just

683
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,039
open

684
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,880
people's eyes to what possibilities are

685
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,799
out there and how they might pursue a

686
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,200
career in technology

687
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,840

688
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,400
we've got two questions with the mic

689
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,480
we are going into lunch so i'm willing

690
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,280
to uh let these questions run but uh

691
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,559
beyond that we're going to cut off our

692
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,640
time so first question at the mic please

693
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,720
state your name and affiliation and ask

694
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,080
your question thank you

695
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,159
hi jill thank you for the great

696
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,799
presentation so i'm lauren schiamenta

697
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,200
i'm from ball state university

698
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,000
and i totally agree with the

699
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,080
i'm survey about ladies going through

700
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,640
the checklist to see if they meet the 9

701
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,159
200 requirement my question is what

702
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,720
advice do you have for us

703
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,840
ladies

704
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
that have to go through all this

705
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
requirement to make sure they meet

706
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
ninety two hundred percent of that

707
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,120
requirement

708
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,080
the um the best advice is to um if you

709
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,240
see something that you don't need

710
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,880
but maybe you meet like sixty percent of

711
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,799
the bullet points just apply what have

712
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,600
you got to lose they might say no which

713
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,200
uh i think for those of us who are

714
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,279
perfectionists can be really hard to

715
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,400
think about

716
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,559
um that failure you know because we

717
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,400
always want to succeed

718
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,159
and work hard

719
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,360
um

720
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,600
but just like it's okay to make mistakes

721
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000
and just try for new opportunities and

722
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,679
you never know

723
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,760
who you might meet along the way um that

724
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,559
might change your direction so

725
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,480
you know similar to how hiring managers

726
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,840
should ask themselves like is that

727
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,360
really a requirement you should ask

728
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,039
yourself that same question when you're

729
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,960
looking at job postings to say

730
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,039
um is this something that i could learn

731
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,880
or even ask yourself is this really a

732
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
requirement for this job and then just

733
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,120
go talk to a real person and ask them

734
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,400
hey i noticed this was in the job

735
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,159
description um

736
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,320
can you tell me more about that and that

737
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,200
might give you a little bit more

738
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
confidence to actually apply for the

739
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,320
role

740
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,440

741
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,400

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,440
online question comes from tony tauber

745
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,039
would you consider a follow-up

746
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,960
presentation to call out cultural

747
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,440
stumbling blocks in workplaces once

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,039

754
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,320
ask your question thank you

755
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,039
hi jill um this is marlene from aws um

756
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,960
i have a question uh related to

757
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,600
what advice would you give employers

758
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,520
like after they have the ideal candidate

759
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,679
um already recruited like let's say you

760
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,120
found this

761
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,039
awesome female engineer

762
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,520
but most of your staff is male

763
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,240
how do you provide a career trajectory

764
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,559
to retain that person on your team

765
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,480
yes um

766
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,279
that is a big problem uh in that nc wit

767
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,360
report that i mentioned at the end

768
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,520
um it talks about the attrition rate uh

769
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
for women and for minorities being

770
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
higher um

771
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,400
as you go through your career because

772
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,760
there's just other barriers that you

773
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,880
face and

774
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,320
you know you might start a job and on

775
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,919
the very first day somebody looks at you

776
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,840
and they're like oh you're an engineer

777
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,000
you don't look like an engineer and all

778
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
those little things kind of build up

779
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,039
um

780
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,200
to give a sense of like maybe not

781
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,600
belonging um which takes a little extra

782
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,799
energy every day and

783
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,760
i think

784
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,600
the thing that's really helpful is if

785
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,679
you have um somebody who's there to

786
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,360
support you and be an advocate for you

787
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,120
even when you're not in the room and

788
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
even starting with this job description

789
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,559
thinking about the language that you're

790
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,960
applying for these roles

791
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,279
taking that same amount of thought

792
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,880
throughout that hiring pipeline and

793
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
throughout that retention pipeline

794
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,679
to

795
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,520
what language am i using

796
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,559
in performance reviews i think a lot of

797
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,520
women

798
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,039
in particular or minorities will hear um

799
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,039
this person's not technical enough as

800
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,799
feedback or like people aren't

801
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,799
perceiving you as technical enough well

802
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,799
it's not really specific feedback and it

803
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,880
takes a lot of courage

804
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,039
um for an employee to to dig in with

805
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,240
their manager i think a really good

806
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,000
manager if somebody asks like hey what

807
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,240
do you mean by this well take a pause

808
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,279
and think

809
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,640
you know that that's an interesting

810
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,000
question i

811
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,520
let's try to get more clear on what this

812
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,440
means and just have clear communication

813
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,799
um

814
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,320
i think that clear communication and

815
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,000
um just

816
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,080
honest support for your colleagues and

817
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,000
collaboration can really help get

818
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,080
through a lot of the challenges that an

819
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,520
organization might face when they're

820
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,039
hiring somebody new for the first time

821
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,640
we're all humans and we all make

822
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,240
mistakes and we all have challenges

823
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,840
regardless of

824
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,799
gender or race um and so if we just

825
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,159
support each other as people i think

826
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,480
that that can help a lot

827
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,440
thank you

828
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,399
