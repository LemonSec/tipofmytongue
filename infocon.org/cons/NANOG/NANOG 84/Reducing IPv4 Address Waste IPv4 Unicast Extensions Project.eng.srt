00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,680
hi everybody i'm seth and i am going to

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,920
talk about the ipv4 unicast extensions

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,960
project

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,360
so thanks to nanog for having me and

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,799
thank you all for

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,640
joining in and looking forward to it and

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,720
sorry not to be there in person

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,039
so we have a small project that's been

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,960
going for a couple of years

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,240
that has

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,760
attracted a fair amount of attention and

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,519
controversy

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,000
and our project aims to reduce the

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,239
degree to which ipv4 addresses are going

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,079
to waste

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,640
this project is led by john gilmore

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,399
and we've had a couple of collaborators

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,239
and a couple of co-authors

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,760
and a number of people have helped us

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,160
out by discussing the

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,719
early history of ipv4

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,320
so we've been able to learn more about

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
how all of these things came to be

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
we have four internet drafts that are

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,160
proposing to unreserve four kinds of

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
ipv4 addresses and we're asking software

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,359
implementers to treat these as ordinary

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,680
unicast addresses

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,438
the four kinds of addresses which i'll

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,680
go through one by one

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,280
are each reserved for a historical

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,439
reason and are not really

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,920
helping people today in many cases those

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,759
pers those purposes for which they were

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,840
reserved didn't really come to fruition

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,680
or didn't become significant in the way

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
that the internet standards community

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,439
thought in the 80s

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,400
so

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,080
by making these changes we have the

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,920
potential to free up a lot of ipv4

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,360
address space

44
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,479
now

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,240
of course not all of these addresses

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
would be usable right away they all have

47
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
compatibility challenges and routability

48
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,520
challenges

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,320
but we'd like to test how well they

50
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,920
would work together with the measurement

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,200
community

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,680
and have the intention that someday

53
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,040
the internet community will have the

54
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,520
option of allocating these addresses for

55
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,680
unicast use to address to number

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
ordinary internet hosts

57
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,079
so in the 80s

58
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
it was less clear whether the internet

59
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,600
would be an experiment or a global

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,759
infrastructure

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,920
scarcity began to loom on the horizon

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
but it was certainly much less of a

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
concrete experience and a practical

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
concern than it is now

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,520
and there were various decisions that

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,440
were taken for various reasons to treat

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,680
certain addresses especially

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
so that instead of being available to

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,680
number hosts like other addresses

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
they were often

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,080
required by standards not to be used

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,560
saying implementations must not generate

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,800
packets to these addresses or must not

74
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
accept them

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,840
or must interpret them in a particular

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,280
way other than numbering a host

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
in retrospect we can now see that a lot

78
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
of those decisions have not proven to be

79
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,000
helpful

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,480
but they're continuing to prevent

81
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,000
large amounts of address space from

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,560
being used for unicast

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,920
so these are our four drafts

84
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,680
for four kinds of addresses we presented

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
the first two at ietf 112

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,120
and a lot of you may have heard

87
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,680
especially about our 127 draft which is

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
probably the most controversial and the

89
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,720
one that has been most discussed

90
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
and i'm going to go through and talk

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,920
about the specific kinds of addresses

92
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,360
we're talking about

93
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,319
the

94
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,800
software work we've been doing

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
what the picture looks like for each of

96
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,879
these

97
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,879
and this is a recording but i will be

98
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,000
available

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
on the day of the presentation for live

100
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,560
questions at the end

101
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,799
okay so the first category of addresses

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,080
that i'm going to talk about is the

103
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,599
lowest address in every subnet

104
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,840
so if we have an address like this slash

105
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,360
24

106
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,599
there are two versions of the broadcast

107
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,599
address the lowest address on the subnet

108
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,159
and the highest address on the subnet

109
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,280
it turns out that tcpip implementers

110
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,560
in the 80s

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
made two different choices about which

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,480
address would be used for broadcast

113
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,159
the highest address

114
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,439
in this case 255 in a slash 24

115
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,599
one out in terms of where the standards

116
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,360
ended up and where the recommendations

117
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,200
and documentation ended up

118
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,599
but documentation continued to note that

119
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,680
for backwards compatibility

120
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,560
with bsd systems from 1983

121
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
you should continue to reserve the

122
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
lowest address as well even though there

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,680
was no specific reason for anyone to be

124
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,199
using it and documentation advised

125
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,680
against it

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
so this continues to waste one address

127
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,280
for every subnet

128
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
if you had a slash 28 for example

129
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
the fact that you have two broadcast

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
addresses instead of just one would be

131
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
fully a sixteenth of the addresses on

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
that network

133
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
and as you subnet smaller and smaller

134
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,240
the

135
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,400
addresses that you lose to duplicative

136
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
broadcast

137
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,840
add

138
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,520
up one interesting thing about this

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
which is different from the other

140
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,120
kinds of addresses that we're talking

141
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
about on reserving

142
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
is that you can actually under existing

143
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,000
standards unilaterally fix this on your

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
own

145
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,880
network and

146
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,360
interoperate under existing standards

147
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,600
with the rest of the internet

148
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
so this is to say

149
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,600
that hosts that are not on your subnet

150
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
are already forbidden from assuming

151
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,639
what netmask you're using because they

152
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,400
don't know where your subnet boundaries

153
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
inside your network are

154
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,440
so

155
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,960
if your router

156
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,800
and your host

157
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,720
interpret the lowest address as a

158
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,880
non-broadcast address the rest of the

159
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,720
internet should already interoperate

160
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,840
with it

161
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,600
and you can find some

162
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,440
sort of practical examples of this on

163
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,639
the aws ec2 reachability page

164
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,120
they have quite a few hosts that you can

165
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,600
ping to see about your ability to reach

166
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,759
ec2

167
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,240
to reach various data centers

168
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,479
and a lot of them actually end in dot

169
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,600
zero

170
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,039
and of course we don't know what their

171
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,039
subnets are we don't know what their net

172
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,680
masks are which is kind of the point but

173
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
if we think of some of them as being

174
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,319
potentially the equivalent of a slash 24

175
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
um

176
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,840
you can see that

177
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
typically

178
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
operating systems and typically routers

179
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,560
are able to reach these

180
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
and so essentially the standards changes

181
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,759
and software changes that we're

182
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,160
proposing in this regard would let

183
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
everyone do the same thing

184
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,000
that perhaps

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
aws is doing here

186
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
and get one extra address per subnet

187
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,319
without requiring any changes on anyone

188
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,319
else's part

189
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
now that's not the case for other kinds

190
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,880
of addresses which i'll go through the

191
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
largest block and this is a much

192
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,800
discussed topic

193
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,080
[Music]

194
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,639
is the experimental the former class e

195
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,680
range that's everything from 240

196
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,720
on up

197
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,520
to

198
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,000
the end of the ipv4 space and this was a

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,639
decision from 1983 to reserve these for

200
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,000
future use

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,680
there was a lot of reason at the time

202
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,240
why people might have wanted to do that

203
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
because they didn't know whether there

204
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
would be new kinds of addressing and new

205
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,759
kinds of modes with different semantics

206
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
for example if you look at the rfc that

207
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,800
first introduced the anycast concept it

208
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,400
originally proposed that any cast

209
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,919
services ought to have their own

210
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,919
dedicated address range

211
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,000
um that turns out not to be the way that

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,080
we do any cast nowadays

213
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,840
but that was a proposal at the time and

214
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,240
there were a number of proposals in the

215
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
early days about different kinds of

216
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,280
addressing with different meanings

217
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,199
multicast was another one that was

218
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,120
actually carved out of the original

219
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,919
original class d block which was split

220
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,280
into class d and class e

221
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,800
and there are other ideas for new

222
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,880
addressing modes but none of them have

223
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,759
been

224
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,599
brought into use except for the

225
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,120
multicast in 224-4

226
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
and today it's extremely unlikely that

227
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
new ipv4 addressing modes will be

228
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,759
invented and actually deployed

229
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,759
and so these addresses that continue to

230
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,759
be reserved for future use are going to

231
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,520
waste

232
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
a smaller network that's also reserved

233
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,520
due to a very early decision in 1981

234
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,280
before we had

235
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
dhcp

236
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,800
and more modern auto configuration

237
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,080
mechanisms

238
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,560
there was a proposal for an icmp based

239
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
auto configuration mechanism

240
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,000
that would perform some of the tasks

241
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,960
that we now

242
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
accomplish with dhcp

243
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,360
the entire zero network zero slash eight

244
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
was reserved

245
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,360
essentially so that this icmp auto

246
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,039
configuration mechanism

247
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
could use it

248
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,960
in my understanding when you connected

249
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,680
your computer to a network it would use

250
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
a zero

251
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
net address

252
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,880
and then send icmp messages and get icmp

253
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
replies

254
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,360
that mechanism was deprecated in 1989

255
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,958
i'm not even sure if it's ever been

256
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,958
implemented and of course now we use

257
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,120
boot p and later dhcp

258
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
and

259
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,640
auto configuration mechanisms that only

260
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,920
use a single

261
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,320
address the all zeros address rather

262
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,279
than

263
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,560
first octet 0. so these addresses

264
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,959
are still reserved for this

265
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,240
thing that was deprecated in 1989.

266
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
okay loop back now this has raised a lot

267
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,760
of controversy and a lot of discussion

268
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,440
but

269
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
ipv6 has only a single loopback address

270
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,640
the double colon one

271
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,600
where

272
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,279
due to a decision back in 1986 ipv4 has

273
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,160
two to the 24 loopback addresses

274
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,320
all of which are defined to mean this

275
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,080
system

276
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,720
now it is possible to find

277
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,040
implementations and software that use

278
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,480
more than one ipv4 loopback address

279
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
but it's relatively uncommon to see

280
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,959
something outside of the 127.0

281
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,959
being used to mean loopback

282
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
and so our draft proposes to unreserve

283
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
them

284
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,800
we've been looking for other examples of

285
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,080
things that may use these we were

286
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,240
contacted by someone who apparently has

287
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,160
a vpn product in japan that's using

288
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,240
these there was a discussion about

289
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,200
whether

290
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,480
the ntp server from the ntp reference

291
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,640
implementation uses them it turns out

292
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,279
that it actually doesn't it uses them

293
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,720
in a configuration file but doesn't

294
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
actually address them it doesn't

295
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,000
actually number

296
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,120
a

297
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,440
service that's connected by a socket

298
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,160
so

299
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
we're still interested in hearing about

300
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
more things that might be using these

301
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
addresses but

302
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,800
the overall point is that we don't

303
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
actually need 2 to the 24

304
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,880
loopback addresses on each host

305
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
we also would like to have a discussion

306
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
about multicast

307
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,160
because multicast is relatively little

308
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,399
used compared to unicast and

309
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,000
the significant majority of the

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,079
multicast range in 224 4 has not been

311
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,480
allocated to multicast at all

312
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,920
so in principle the majority of those

313
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,680
addresses could be reclaimed

314
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,079
i find this to be a more complicated and

315
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
more challenging matter than

316
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,959
some of the others partly because

317
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,880
the allocations that were made are

318
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,399
non-contiguous

319
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,240
they're more interleaved so you have a

320
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
used an allocated

321
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,720
multicast address followed by

322
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,800
a multicast block followed by

323
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,720
unallocated multicast blocks and they're

324
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,240
mixed together

325
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,160
so we don't actually have an internet

326
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,399
draft about this address space about

327
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,640
reclaiming multicast but it is

328
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,880
a portion of the ipv4 space that also is

329
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,680
significantly underused

330
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
so there's a question about how to

331
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
measure how many addresses we might be

332
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,640
able to get back by making software

333
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,160
changes and standards changes that

334
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,040
reinterpret these addresses

335
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,160
the unicast lowest address the

336
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,000
removing the semantics of the

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,839
duplicative broadcast address is

338
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,120
especially hard to measure because we

339
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,399
would need to know how many subnets

340
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,360
there are

341
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
and as i mentioned we don't know how

342
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,240
many subnets there are because they're

343
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
not necessarily visible outside of

344
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
their own networks

345
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,839
but we would get one per subnet

346
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,160
from 240 we'd get more than six percent

347
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,959
of all of ipv4 and for each of the

348
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,040
others we would get about

349
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
0.3 of all of ipv4

350
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
and if we could reclaim

351
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
portions of multicast we would also get

352
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,480
hundreds of millions of addresses there

353
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
so we've been working on

354
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
attempting to get some of these changes

355
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
into implementations

356
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,040
we have not attempted to get the 127

357
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,320
change into

358
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,240
implementations although we have tested

359
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,920
it

360
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,519
and it worked

361
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,680
properly on a local network

362
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,720
but we and other people have proposed

363
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
some of the other changes that i've

364
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,519
talked about for deployment and

365
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,800
implementations

366
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
and

367
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,480
a somewhat little known fact that we

368
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,200
find very significant in terms of the

369
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
feasibility and consequences of making

370
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,639
some of these changes

371
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,839
is that

372
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,760
the last time that there was a major

373
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,399
effort to unreserve g40 slash four at

374
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,040
ietf which was in 2008

375
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
a large number of implementers even

376
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,600
though that draft was not adopted as an

377
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,639
rfc

378
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,560
actually implemented it and made the

379
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,279
software changes in 2008

380
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,320
so

381
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,560
most operating systems

382
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,440
now

383
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,560
support 240 slash 4 as unicast already

384
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,240
even though rfcs suggest that they

385
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,920
should not

386
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
we've also got our patches to change the

387
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,600
broadcast semantics

388
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,680
in the linux and freebsd mainline

389
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,360
and we got uh patches into linux as well

390
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,200
for zero slash eight to treat it as

391
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,120
ordinary unicast of course with the

392
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,360
exception of

393
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,240
0.0.0.0 which is used for auto

394
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,959
configuration

395
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,440
as i mentioned we've tested

396
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,519
changes for 127

397
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,160
but due to various concerns we have not

398
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,199
proposed

399
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,760
uh that those become default behavior in

400
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,199
operating systems

401
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,120
to date

402
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,199
these changes generally are quite small

403
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,040
as you can imagine and they generally

404
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,839
consist of removing special cases in the

405
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,360
ip implementation

406
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,959
and then testing interoperability to

407
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,199
make sure that configuration tools can

408
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,880
assign the addresses and that other

409
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,720
software will use it and all of that

410
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,040
but often it involves basically removing

411
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,800
a single condition

412
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
in the ip implementation which is the

413
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
condition that would have treated an

414
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,320
address range specially

415
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,079
so that it returns to the default of

416
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,120
treating it as an ordinary address

417
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,839
another fairly significant thing is that

418
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,360
typically when these changes have been

419
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
made no one has noticed

420
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
so in terms of anyone's potential

421
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,120
concern about disruption

422
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,959
or problems that might arise or

423
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,560
compatibility

424
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,120
a lot of you already have some of these

425
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,199
behaviors in your operating systems and

426
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,959
probably didn't know it

427
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,120
now of course attempting to

428
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,279
announce these ranges in bgp and

429
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,360
everything is much more complicated and

430
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
poses a whole other set of issues but in

431
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,199
terms of the software changes which are

432
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,399
the main thing that we're proposing

433
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,600
right now

434
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,440
a lot of them can actually be done and

435
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,519
just no one notices because addresses

436
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,560
that they don't use are no longer

437
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,160
rejected

438
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,079
and that doesn't specifically cause them

439
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,920
any harm or any

440
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,560
damage in anything

441
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,760
right

442
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,360
we have yet to find anyone actually

443
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
complaining about any of these changes

444
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,680
breaking anything especially the huge

445
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,839
change uh to forty slash four back

446
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,120
around 2008 and subsequently

447
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,639
so you might be watching this very

448
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
presentation right now on a device that

449
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
actually accepts two forty slash four

450
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,839
addresses as unicast

451
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
we've tried setting up wi-fi networks

452
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,480
that assign those addresses internally

453
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,199
and do nat to the public internet

454
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,480
and typically clients other than windows

455
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,800
windows not having made this change

456
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,480
worked fine out of the box without any

457
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,800
special configuration they got two forty

458
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
slash four addresses via dhcp they

459
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,959
assigned them they used them

460
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,880
and they could get online and

461
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
use ordinary services

462
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,600
so microsoft is kind of the outlier here

463
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,199
in terms of continuing to actively

464
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,480
forbid interoperability with these

465
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
addresses

466
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,120
you might also find that certain cpe

467
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,240
routers

468
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,639
are not happy to for example give these

469
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,120
addresses out via dhcp

470
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,399
we're interested in hearing about

471
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,320
people's experiences with that because

472
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,920
that may be an interesting category of

473
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,959
devices that's a bit more difficult

474
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,360
in comparison to laptops and phones and

475
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,320
so on

476
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,920
but i would encourage people to try this

477
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
for yourself if you're curious um we

478
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,320
were kind of pleasantly surprised

479
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,040
i took one of these to a conference and

480
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
told people hey do you want to martian

481
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,000
address on your very own computer and

482
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,519
people were able to get online just fine

483
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,040
as long as they were not running windows

484
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
laptops um

485
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,880
so a lot of the controversy that some of

486
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,959
these ideas stir up

487
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,880
is about the fact that we've had a lot

488
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,560
of these standards since the 80s now

489
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,639
they may have been

490
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,160
established for reasons that are no

491
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,399
longer applicable or no longer useful

492
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,839
but they've been in place and they've

493
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,000
influenced implementers and influenced

494
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
the behavior of implementations

495
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,600
and so

496
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,279
that of course means that if we change

497
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,399
that now

498
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,160
we have a very large installed base of

499
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,640
systems that will potentially not

500
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,919
recognize the changes and not

501
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,679
interoperate

502
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,039
and that can be a very concrete

503
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,640
interoperability problem right if you

504
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,119
have machines a and b and a says cool

505
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,000
these addresses are valid i can use them

506
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,599
and machine b says these are martian

507
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,880
addresses i can't use them

508
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,640
then they they won't interoperate with

509
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,319
each other and of course it takes time

510
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,240
to update software

511
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,039
and

512
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,559
it will take

513
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,400
some time and people have

514
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
started the discussion to some extent of

515
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,160
how much time

516
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,039
it will take to get significant

517
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,080
software updates rolled out to define

518
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,600
the addresses that we're talking about

519
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
as valid and usable

520
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,080
so this is a good reason that we should

521
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,480
have made these changes back in 2008

522
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,880
because we would have all of this time

523
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
elapsed since then it's a good reason

524
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,160
that we should have made these changes

525
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,960
back in 1999

526
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,160
and it's a good reason that we should

527
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,320
start making these changes now in order

528
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,320
to keep our options open for the future

529
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
so there's the famous saying the best

530
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,799
time to plant the tree was 30 years ago

531
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,280
and the second best time is now

532
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,679
and i keep coming back to that in terms

533
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,200
of talking about this because i fully

534
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,160
understand

535
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,480
that we are not going to have

536
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,360
universal compatibility if the ietf were

537
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,520
to publish all of these as an rfc

538
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,960
tomorrow

539
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,440
um we would not have universal

540
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,000
compatibility or

541
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
extremely widespread compatibility for

542
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,960
some years

543
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
although we want to do empirical

544
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
measurements and find out

545
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,960
you know concretely what that looks like

546
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,840
but we fully understand that it would be

547
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,600
years before

548
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,840
software support was in place to make

549
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,280
some of these addresses usable for

550
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,840
certain purposes

551
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,280
our view is

552
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,600
that this is something that we

553
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,919
regret and can regret not having started

554
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,039
earlier

555
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,000
and that if we don't start it now we may

556
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,760
have cause to regret in the future that

557
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,200
we didn't start it now

558
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
we would really like to work with the

559
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,799
measurement community

560
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,679
and try to get some empirical tests

561
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,640
about

562
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
what happens if we attempt to use

563
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,080
reserved addresses

564
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,320
we don't want to do this you know by

565
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,240
surprise we want to

566
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,919
kill people on nog lists we want to

567
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,760
discuss with the community we want to

568
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,720
get permission we want to

569
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
work with mainstream measurement

570
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,520
entities

571
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,919
and we want to see what would happen

572
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,679
and what can we learn about how widely

573
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,600
reserved addresses are treated specially

574
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
or are not treated specially

575
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,200
and we think that gathering empirical

576
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,080
data

577
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,919
and having recurring measurements can

578
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,440
also inform

579
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,720
a decision

580
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,280
some years from now to potentially

581
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
allocate historically reserved address

582
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,480
space

583
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,200
now i like to make an analogy and people

584
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,640
may have

585
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,960
questions about exactly how exact this

586
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,200
analogy is but i like to make an analogy

587
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,880
to the extremely popular service at

588
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,200
1.1.1.1

589
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
from cloudflare their public recursive

590
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,840
dns resolver which they launched in 2018

591
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,360
and they found that quite a lot of

592
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,200
people had actually hard-coded blocking

593
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,559
that

594
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,640
and on day one when they launched it

595
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,360
quite a lot of people could not reach it

596
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,799
now there was not an internet standard

597
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,799
that clearly indicated that you ought to

598
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,000
block that

599
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
but many networks did anyway

600
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,240
and cloudflare worked really hard with

601
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,000
the community

602
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
looking into specific reports of people

603
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,840
who couldn't reach it

604
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
doing measurements doing tests and

605
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,880
working with isps to isolate where the

606
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,000
routability problems were for 1.1.1.1

607
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,559
and they deboganized it and they're

608
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,080
still deborganizing it but they've

609
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,440
gotten to a very high reachability

610
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
so we believe that we could follow a

611
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,200
similar process

612
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,520
with formerly reserved addresses

613
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,159
now i imagine but i don't know because

614
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,840
we haven't done the measurements

615
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,679
that the reachability would start off

616
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,760
considerably lower

617
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,640
but cloudflare enjoyed wide public

618
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,720
support because people understood that

619
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,480
it was doing something useful

620
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,280
in debugging addresses in providing

621
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
services with those addresses

622
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
and it got a lot of cooperation from the

623
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,760
user and operator communities

624
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,159
in going ahead with that deborganization

625
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,039
process network by network by network

626
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,320
so there are a lot of concerns that

627
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,400
people have about these proposals

628
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,080
and a lot of reasons that they think

629
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,600
that this may not be a useful thing to

630
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,480
do

631
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,919
and we've heard quite a few of those

632
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,000
we've heard them at itf when we

633
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,720
presented we've also heard them on lists

634
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,120
like the nano list and other network

635
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,400
operators lists

636
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,080
now most of those were focused on our

637
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,640
draft about 127

638
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,320
which got really spread around quite

639
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,200
widely and quite actively

640
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,799
some of them were broader and some of

641
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,120
them did address the other drafts

642
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,039
and i'd just like to point out

643
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,159
that

644
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,520
the concerns about particular drafts

645
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,039
may be different from one draft to

646
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,520
another and the simplest example of that

647
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,640
is again

648
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,880
with existing standards you can already

649
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,720
unilaterally use the lowest address if

650
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,559
you patch your own systems

651
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,120
you can do that unilaterally by yourself

652
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,080
you don't need a new rfc

653
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,480
you need a new rfc in order to say that

654
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,000
your

655
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,120
lan router and your host

656
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,520
are allowed to use it but you can also

657
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,120
just patch them and then you can just

658
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,559
use it

659
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,720
whereas you know for the other address

660
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
ranges things can get more complicated

661
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,799
and they can get more complicated in

662
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,240
different ways

663
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,400
so i want to just talk about a few of

664
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
the most common objections and concerns

665
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,600
that people have

666
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,039
and i imagine that

667
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
later on in the questions people may

668
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,360
have

669
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
others or may have elaborations on these

670
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,280
but i'll just mention a few of them that

671
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,200
we've been hearing

672
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,280
so the most common one is presumably

673
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,200
about ipv6

674
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,320
and

675
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,400
various versions of why not just use

676
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,240
ipv6

677
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,200
do ipv6 instead people should learn ipv6

678
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,240
instead

679
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
this is delaying the ipv6 rollout

680
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,679
various

681
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,760
concerns like that

682
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,559
so

683
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,200
i would emphasize that we favor adoption

684
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,880
of ipv6

685
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
and we still want to mitigate the

686
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,039
scarcity of ipv4 addresses which

687
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,679
continues to cause really significant

688
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,280
pain and difficulty

689
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,840
for lots of

690
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,760
people we also think

691
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,799
that

692
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,960
while trends that show increased use of

693
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
ipv6 are a great thing

694
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,760
and they're definitely continuing

695
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,919
projections for when ipv6 would

696
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,720
hypothetically completely replace v4

697
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,679
and v4 would hypothetically no longer be

698
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,679
used or no longer be desired to be used

699
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,919
or no longer be useful

700
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,840
expert projections on this seem to place

701
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,880
it still decades away and in some cases

702
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,120
suggest that it will never occur

703
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
but ipv4 address scarcity pain is

704
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,480
something that people really contend

705
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
with every day

706
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,120
some people have also suggested that the

707
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,120
resources that would go into

708
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,200
changing this and this specifically

709
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,600
applies most to software

710
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,240
would be better spent on implementing

711
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,679
ipv6 or making things compatible with v6

712
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,080
and i think that in most cases this is a

713
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,360
false dilemma in the sense that

714
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,320
most

715
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,120
operating systems already have great v6

716
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,799
support

717
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,159
and it's more of an operational matter

718
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,159
whether people can actually make use of

719
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,840
the v6 support that they already have in

720
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,120
software

721
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,640
so i don't think at least on the

722
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,720
software side which is where the

723
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,159
most changes have to happen earliest

724
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,440
that there are

725
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,919
people saying oh i wonder if i should

726
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,600
have my operating system capable of

727
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,039
supporting v6

728
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,799
well maybe i'll put that off because i

729
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,120
want to do this unicast extension thing

730
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
we just don't think that that's actually

731
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,240
the

732
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,120
dilemma facing implementers we think

733
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,279
that the v6 software support is already

734
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,640
there

735
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,200
and i would certainly agree that if

736
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,799
there are particular devices if there

737
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,279
are embedded systems if there are

738
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,799
wi-fi routers

739
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,679
that don't have good v6 support

740
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,320
then clearly to me v6 support is a

741
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,240
higher priority than making these

742
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,120
changes

743
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,039
i just don't think that that's a common

744
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,760
situation facing device makers and

745
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,600
facing os vendors

746
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,400
now there's also a view

747
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,080
that nobody should work on v4 anymore

748
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,000
based on the idea that

749
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,640
we want to show a unified front in our

750
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
commitment to v6 and make everyone take

751
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,919
v6 seriously

752
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,320
there was a long discussion there was a

753
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,720
ietf working group called sunset four

754
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,600
which ran from 2012 to 2018

755
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,080
and it specifically proposed that we

756
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,720
should formally deprecate v4

757
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,480
or formerly formally forbid

758
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,800
ietf from continuing to maintain it

759
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,520
[Music]

760
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,120
there were a lot of participants in that

761
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,240
working group

762
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,000
who were enthusiastic about these

763
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,200
proposals

764
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,679
but these proposals did not gain an ietf

765
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,120
wide consensus

766
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,440
so current itf policy

767
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,039
requires in various ways that

768
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,360
new protocols and new deployments

769
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,080
should be compatible with v6

770
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,320
that you shouldn't go and invent a new

771
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,400
protocol and make it be v4 only or

772
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
something

773
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,279
and that seems like an extremely

774
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,000
sensible policy but the policy is

775
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,799
pro

776
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,679
v6 compatibility

777
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,440
there has never been an ietf wide

778
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,480
consensus

779
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,240
that we should start to neglect or

780
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,320
abandon v4

781
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,640
and not for lack of interest

782
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,679
ipv4 as i'm sure everyone here knows

783
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,520
is the most used network layer protocol

784
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,200
in the world

785
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,880
and it's an extremely important

786
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,080
technology

787
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
that a lot of people are extraordinarily

788
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,000
reliant on

789
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,120
and

790
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,039
we don't think that neglecting it or

791
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,039
abandoning it or deprecating it

792
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,039
constitutes an ipv6 transition strategy

793
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,640
and again i

794
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,039
celebrate people's efforts to encourage

795
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,760
adoption of v6 and v6 compatibility and

796
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,360
i think that's very important work and

797
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,640
very good work

798
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,559
that clearly should continue and clearly

799
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,880
will continue now another thing that

800
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,000
we've heard

801
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,240
is that since the demand is so high we

802
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,080
can really blow through

803
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,960
ipv4 blocks very very quickly

804
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,240
and the last

805
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,640
blocks that were allocated by the rirs

806
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,159
went very very quickly because there

807
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,399
were tons of people in line and they

808
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,559
got them

809
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,840
so

810
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,520
we think that this experience is

811
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,679
unlikely to be repeated if the

812
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,399
allocations are willing to make use of

813
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,039
market mechanisms and market pricing

814
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,880
because the market pricing for ipv4

815
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,200
address space has gone up quite a bit

816
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,799
which is something that's really

817
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,000
incentivized more efficient uses of

818
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
address space that becomes available

819
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,679
whether that becomes available

820
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,520
because of legacy allocations getting

821
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,399
sold whether that becomes available

822
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,640
for whatever reason

823
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,880
the market prices are really really

824
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,360
encouraging people to look closely at

825
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,840
how they use that

826
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,080
space and so the demand certainly is

827
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,320
enormous but we think that the

828
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,960
quantity that's demanded if the

829
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,919
addresses are given out for free or

830
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,279
just for

831
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,279
administrative fees will be quite

832
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,559
different from if they're given out at

833
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,200
market prices

834
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,399
now in 2008 full earlier and meyer

835
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,880
proposed

836
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
that 240 slash 4

837
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
should be made available for unicast and

838
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,559
they proposed that at itf and it didn't

839
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,720
get adopted as an rfc though as i

840
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,279
mentioned it did get adopted by a lot of

841
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,279
software implementations

842
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,000
and one major concern that was raised at

843
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,039
the time

844
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,960
is that it's really hard

845
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,120
today with so many implementations out

846
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
there and such a large installed base of

847
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,679
systems on the internet to change the

848
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,520
semantics of address space because then

849
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,240
there will be systems that will disagree

850
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,559
about what an address means

851
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,840
and in fact there have been some

852
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,919
security problems about

853
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,840
uh other changes

854
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,640
to the semantics of 127.

855
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,320
um i can get into that if people are

856
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,240
interested but

857
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,360
our changes actually are

858
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,600
better but that's a long story about the

859
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,000
127 semantics but the the broader

860
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,120
concern

861
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,520
that people raise

862
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,600
understandably is

863
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
it's concerning if there are systems on

864
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
the internet that

865
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,640
interpret an address differently

866
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,080
and the most common way that they would

867
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,240
interpret it as

868
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,880
legal or illegal right whether you're

869
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,320
allowed to use this address or not

870
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
allowed to use this address

871
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,279
so

872
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,279
people were concerned about that in 2008

873
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,200
they're concerned about that at itf when

874
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,240
we talked about our current proposals

875
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,039
but

876
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,799
i would just note that implementations

877
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,399
already disagree

878
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,080
about whether these addresses are valid

879
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,000
or not and in fact since so many

880
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,880
implementations changed in 2008 the

881
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,480
status quo is that there's a very

882
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,799
widespread disagreement about whether

883
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,880
two forty slash four in particular and

884
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,559
to a lesser extent other addresses that

885
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,279
we're talking about are valid or not

886
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,240
so if we want hosts to

887
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,440
interpret all addresses in the same way

888
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,240
standardizing 240 4 as valid in

889
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,360
particular

890
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,880
is actually the most efficient way to

891
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,320
get back to

892
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,039
stronger consensus among implementations

893
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,559
so we have been doing some of our own

894
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,679
testing we have been numbering lands

895
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,399
with some of these reserved addresses

896
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,200
um

897
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
making sure that things work

898
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,360
we would like to scale that up we would

899
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,880
like to do more of that we'd like to

900
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,200
work with the measurement community

901
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,159
and just to repeat we think it will be

902
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,080
quite a while before it would be

903
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,600
straightforward to allocate these

904
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,279
addresses

905
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,120
in the way that other unicast addresses

906
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,399
are used

907
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,720
but we think that it's quite likely

908
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,919
just as people in 2008 may have doubted

909
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,720
whether ipv4 would still be important

910
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,200
in 2022

911
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,519
we think ipv4 will probably still be

912
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,840
important probably be widely used

913
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
probably numbering resources will still

914
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,080
be desired

915
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,120
some years from now

916
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,880
and of course there's enormous economic

917
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,080
value and hundreds of millions of

918
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,679
dollars have been paid

919
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,679
for large blocks

920
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,679
there is a

921
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,120
opinion that we've heard a number of

922
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,799
times i think a minority opinion but

923
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,360
definitely an opinion that's represented

924
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,320
that

925
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,000
ipv4 being expensive is actually good

926
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,960
because it will encourage ipv6 adoption

927
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,880
and in this view

928
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,440
anything that makes ipv4 resources more

929
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,000
available

930
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,679
is actually counterproductive

931
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,399
so i think this could be an entire

932
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,559
panel debate in itself about the

933
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,039
different incentives but we actually

934
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,840
are

935
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,679
not especially persuaded by this in

936
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,000
terms of our own view of people's

937
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,519
incentives

938
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,799
and

939
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,559
you know the simplest

940
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,519
way to think about this is if you

941
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,320
are

942
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,399
putting up a public web service that's

943
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,919
intended to be used by the general

944
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,760
public around the world

945
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,360
it's very likely

946
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,559
that you

947
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,519
want

948
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,480
ipv4 numbering to be available for that

949
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,080
service it's very likely that you want

950
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,720
it to be dual stack

951
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,559
not because of any ideological

952
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,679
opposition

953
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,279
to v6

954
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,440
just because you know

955
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,760
that you have potential users

956
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,200
who in fact only have v4 connectivity

957
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,640
and you want those users to be able to

958
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,880
access that service and that creates

959
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,440
economic demand which would create value

960
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,840
for you as the operator of that site or

961
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,559
service if it could be satisfied

962
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,279
so my projection is that

963
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,720
if there comes a time when these

964
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,960
addresses can be allocated

965
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,000
the most predominant use that they would

966
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,039
see

967
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,799
is in supporting

968
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,600
dual stack public services in cloud

969
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,559
hosting

970
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,960
of course it's impossible to prove that

971
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,000
that would be the only use

972
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
but i think that that's the predominant

973
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
use that we would expect to see and we

974
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,519
think that

975
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,799
increases in the price of v4 resources

976
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,880
increases in the difficulty of getting

977
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,080
v4 resources again are not themselves a

978
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,320
v6 transition or adoption strategy

979
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,120
so that's all i have here at least for

980
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
the recorded presentation

981
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,320
and i

982
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,000
really appreciate the opportunity to be

983
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
here i know that we're presenting

984
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,640
something that is quite controversial

985
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,440
and quite discussed and i hope that

986
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,280
i've helped you understand a little bit

987
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,639
more of our thinking

988
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,800
and i'm very happy and looking forward

989
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,599
to

990
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,359
talking more about this

991
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,399
and we'll be switching over to a live

992
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,399
question and answer session

993
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,960
thanks a lot

994
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,679
thank you seth

995
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,839
what do we have questions

996
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,599
let's uh

997
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,879
start with mike first and we'll

998
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,000
alternate

999
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,440
please hi my name is lee howard

1000
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,199
i'm with ipv4 dot global by helico

1001
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,280
stream bank

1002
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,520
also the author of draft howard sunset

1003
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,679
for before historic so i feel like my

1004
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,599
name came up a couple times this is

1005
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,599
really good presentation this was um i

1006
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,280
appreciate it i think that um

1007
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,800
of the drafts that you have and i feel

1008
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,720
like an ietf meeting i'm sorry i haven't

1009
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,520
read your draft but um

1010
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,680
it seems to me that that the only one

1011
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,599
that is really so that

1012
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,720
the market excluding m a is transferring

1013
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,359
about three million addresses a month

1014
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,920
right so okay take that as an average

1015
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,079
um and you probably get so the 127 to

1016
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,800
slash eight that gets us you know that

1017
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,480
that that feeds the demand for a little

1018
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,000
while the only one that's really

1019
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,760
material though i think is 240 slash

1020
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,800
four

1021
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,240
what you didn't mention i think is um

1022
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,440
you mentioned that all the various

1023
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,359
operating systems that ken sporter do

1024
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,320
support

1025
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,920
you didn't mention routers or firewalls

1026
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,160
or things that might have logic in in

1027
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,560
you know not hard coded but etched

1028
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,960
in silicon um what what does that look

1029
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,040
like

1030
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,400
thanks uh can you hear me all right

1031
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,280
um

1032
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,839
yeah thanks and uh

1033
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,839
thanks for the comments and everything

1034
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,240
and i have definitely encountered you

1035
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,760
and your name quite a number of times in

1036
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,440
this area so

1037
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,000
um it's great to see you and talk to you

1038
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,200
and hear from you um

1039
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,359
yeah so one thing that

1040
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,839
i did hear is some people say that there

1041
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,119
were certain

1042
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,839
firewalls for example that had asic

1043
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,359
based

1044
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,520
bogon or martian tables

1045
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,400
not just having that as a future in the

1046
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,599
routing table

1047
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,760
but actually having an asic logic do a

1048
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,720
comparison and say oh that's 127.

1049
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,040
drop

1050
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,520
and we haven't actually had that many

1051
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,920
people contact us with those details

1052
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,720
so i feel like this is one of these

1053
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,240
unfortunate things about some of the

1054
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,079
controversy that came up in the sense

1055
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,680
that

1056
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,400
when we make internet drafts

1057
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
one of the purposes of that is to hear

1058
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,440
from people who have information that

1059
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,960
would bear on

1060
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,560
whether our drafts are good and whether

1061
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,000
they would work

1062
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,200
and

1063
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,040
there were a lot of people who said in

1064
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,480
terms of their

1065
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,320
enthusiasm for v6 adoption that they

1066
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,480
were kind of mad that we were proposing

1067
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,760
these things

1068
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,920
but there were fewer people who said hey

1069
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,599
i have this juniper device i think

1070
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,200
juniper was one of the ones that people

1071
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,760
suggested may have asic-based

1072
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,680
restrictions um

1073
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,000
i have this juniper device and i know

1074
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
for a fact that it can't route some of

1075
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,760
the address fingers that you're talking

1076
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,800
about

1077
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,240
things like that so i would still love

1078
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,520
to hear from people about that because

1079
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,119
i agree that that's a gap in our

1080
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,560
knowledge

1081
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
we've tried

1082
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,839
some of these to some extent

1083
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,040
but

1084
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,560
it's a lot easier

1085
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,920
for us to get

1086
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,599
operating systems and try them out

1087
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,200
rather than

1088
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,040
backbone routers and

1089
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,359
fancy firewalls and so on and so yeah if

1090
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,520
people have information about that um i

1091
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,960
agree that there's a set of concerns

1092
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,599
there about things that are in hardware

1093
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,520
that would literally be the forklift

1094
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,800
upgrade

1095
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,000
and we just

1096
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,520
have not

1097
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,720
had a lot of information on that and

1098
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,119
we'd love more got it i just want to be

1099
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,320
clear that

1100
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,599
as an ardent ipv6 advocate um and as as

1101
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,160
an ipv4 address broker my goal is the

1102
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,240
stability of the internet like i don't

1103
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,880
i'm not saying we should like halt this

1104
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,320
work i think this is probably really

1105
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,079
good and useful work in many ways and so

1106
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,160
i so i actually support making progress

1107
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,920
with this and gathering more information

1108
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,440
on on what the limitations might be if

1109
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,280
there are some thank you

1110
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,760
yeah thank you very much

1111
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,520
we'll take our next question um from the

1112
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,560
online uh q a from uh coming to us from

1113
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,480
james harr what is your response to

1114
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,160
concerns about uh putting effort into

1115
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,760
prolonging ibb4 versus investing in ipv6

1116
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,119
yeah well i talked a little bit about

1117
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,320
that in the recorded presentation um

1118
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,760
i think that

1119
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,560
many of the contrasts that people see

1120
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,520
in terms of

1121
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,359
when people talk about

1122
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,680
software changes or standards changes i

1123
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,079
think are often false dilemmas

1124
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,680
that these things don't actually

1125
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,839
directly compete with each other

1126
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,079
i think um

1127
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,680
and lee will certainly remember this

1128
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,280
from the sunset four archives which i

1129
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,119
didn't participate in but i have read

1130
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,520
all of as part of this project

1131
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,640
that

1132
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,960
there is this issue about

1133
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,320
um one might say perception management

1134
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,359
where

1135
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,640
a number of people in sunset forest said

1136
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,280
it will help v6 adoption

1137
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,079
if people feel

1138
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,240
that v4 is doomed or maybe more

1139
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,160
positively it will help v6 adoption if

1140
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,320
people feel that there's a really strong

1141
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,079
broad consensus from all parts of the

1142
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,920
entire internet community

1143
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,520
around backing it

1144
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,850
um

1145
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,680
[Music]

1146
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,119
so i feel like those things are tricky

1147
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,119
because i understand i also

1148
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,680
really support v6 adoption

1149
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,359
i gave a talk many years ago to

1150
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,960
introduce v6 to some audiences and i

1151
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,800
was very excited and i still think it's

1152
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
a great thing that

1153
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,839
um

1154
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,839
definitely should continue to happen and

1155
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,440
will continue to happen

1156
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,720
but

1157
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,320
yeah there's this there's this issue

1158
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,839
that was discussed quite a bit in sunset

1159
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,520
four about

1160
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,560
sort of are people taking this seriously

1161
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,200
are they viewing it as urgent and if we

1162
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,960
do certain kinds of maintenance work on

1163
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,850
v4 are they going to

1164
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,040
[Music]

1165
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,119
view it as less urgent

1166
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,640
and i guess

1167
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,079
i would also be happy to continue

1168
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,520
talking about that with people because i

1169
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,440
think that's interesting because i would

1170
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,359
love to

1171
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,079
find ways to make v4 maintenance not be

1172
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,119
viewed as a substitute for v6

1173
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,599
in terms of not having people say

1174
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,319
oh i guess because maybe 240 is going to

1175
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,240
be unreserved i don't have to think

1176
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,200
about v6 at all

1177
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,880
i would not want to encourage people to

1178
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,560
think in that way i would want them to

1179
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,480
think yeah i need to have v6 support on

1180
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,319
my services

1181
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,920
you know that if i want to maximize

1182
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,839
compatibility i need to be dual stack

1183
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,760
and so i'd be happy to talk to people

1184
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,920
more about that um about how to avoid

1185
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,880
that perception i feel like

1186
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,640
from the cases we've seen on the

1187
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
scenarios we've seen it mostly does feel

1188
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,520
like it's not really

1189
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,280
one or the other

1190
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,319
that a lot of the demand um

1191
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,319
and you know maybe people who are

1192
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,000
involved in the broker space likely can

1193
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,839
speak to how true this is or how

1194
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,000
widespread this is but

1195
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,599
a lot of the demand i believe comes from

1196
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,359
people who are dual stack or who are

1197
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,640
attempting to be dual stack who

1198
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,079
understand very well that piece of fix

1199
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,440
is important for them

1200
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,640
and they still

1201
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,880
know that there are a lot of networks

1202
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,319
that they want to interoperate with that

1203
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,680
are before

1204
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,920
um

1205
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,720
but yeah i'd love to talk more to people

1206
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,599
about all of those issues

1207
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,640
thanks

1208
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,640
um question from the right

1209
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,319
hi uh chris woodfield with twitter um i

1210
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,119
would have a lot to say about this but

1211
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,560
that would put me at the mic for

1212
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,040
probably longer than i should be um so

1213
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,720
i'll limit to

1214
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,920
a pair of observations and a question

1215
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,480
i've been researching this on my own

1216
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,520
recently and one little point of fact to

1217
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,720
the

1218
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,920
the what you mentioned the foss

1219
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,839
dichotomy of

1220
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,400
the effort to support this

1221
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,280
is that i'll point out that the kernel

1222
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,480
patch to enable routing 240 slash four

1223
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,800
in the linux kernel um i think that

1224
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,000
patch got merged in 2009

1225
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,359
was 17 lines of code excluding comments

1226
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,880
um

1227
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,680
and it's exactly what you said it's

1228
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,640
removing the places that through errors

1229
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,119
if someone tried to configure 240 slash

1230
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,880
four if it were for hack it came 240

1231
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,400
slash four

1232
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,839
just in the past year one of the major

1233
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,240
network hardware vendors added a config

1234
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,319
knob to explicitly allow

1235
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,400
routing 240 slash four

1236
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,760
um

1237
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,119
which personally i think is good news um

1238
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,720
so to the question

1239
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,079
is

1240
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,599
you're talking about the interop testing

1241
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,319
that that's been going on is is there

1242
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,040
any public registry or reports or

1243
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,040
anything is anyone maintaining a

1244
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,960
compatibility list

1245
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,400
that people can

1246
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,359
access and contribute to at this point

1247
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,599
um i probably should start

1248
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,680
because since we have the internet

1249
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,079
drafts out there

1250
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,599
there's now a public thing to point

1251
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,720
people out

1252
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,280
um we have a very out of date list

1253
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,440
on github that i have not

1254
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,280
updated since i started working on this

1255
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,760
project

1256
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,800
in

1257
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,560
late 2020

1258
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,319
and so it's in it was entirely

1259
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,880
maintained by dave's uh co-author who

1260
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,359
was working on the project before

1261
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,359
so basically the answer is nothing

1262
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,760
current but i ought to and thank you for

1263
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,560
the prod on that

1264
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,880
yeah i mean that the patches are very

1265
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,240
small right we thought um

1266
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,920
dave got a

1267
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
zero slash eight patch in the linux

1268
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,760
kernel which was also tiny i got a

1269
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
lowest address patch in the linux kernel

1270
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,680
which was also tiny

1271
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,839
we worked with freebsd developers to get

1272
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,240
a lowest address patch in freebsd

1273
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,880
also tiny

1274
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,480
so the

1275
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,160
operating system changes can be very

1276
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,640
small now there are collateral things

1277
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,920
right like

1278
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,400
can dhcp clients and servers accept

1279
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,119
addresses that have been reserved

1280
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,640
and um

1281
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,720
so it's not like well we make one change

1282
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,240
one time in one place and that's

1283
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,240
completely perfect support in all

1284
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,319
respects on an operating system

1285
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,680
um

1286
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,000
but yeah it can be small changes um in

1287
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,040
terms of what you were saying about the

1288
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,280
good news of 240 working better

1289
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,680
there's also sort of the fallback issue

1290
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,520
that um

1291
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,960
in 2008 the other draft

1292
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,880
that existed as an internet draft at the

1293
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,920
same time proposed that 240-4 should be

1294
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,040
made

1295
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,520
rfc 1918 style private address space

1296
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,640
and

1297
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,560
i think in the recorded talk i alluded

1298
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,400
to this but there are unofficial uses

1299
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,000
that people are making now along those

1300
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,119
lines

1301
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,440
and they basically have to know their

1302
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,040
own software environment to know whether

1303
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,839
that will work or not

1304
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,000
and in certain software environments it

1305
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,280
works great and in other software

1306
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,560
environments it would not work

1307
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,640
but

1308
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,520
we

1309
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,319
certainly would prefer to get to a place

1310
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:33,520
where

1311
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,440
the addresses that we're talking about

1312
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,760
could be allocated as public global

1313
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,520
scope addresses

1314
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,119
we know that there are empirical

1315
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,720
difficulties and empirical questions

1316
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
about whether that could ever occur

1317
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,079
whether that could occur on a certain

1318
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,119
time scale

1319
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,319
i think one thing to be

1320
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,079
to bear in mind

1321
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,040
is that

1322
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,839
if we make the software changes widely

1323
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,280
and then the measurements and

1324
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,480
experiments are done and the

1325
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,119
compatibility is comparatively poor

1326
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,599
there is still value in falling back to

1327
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,280
the private use

1328
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,400
because then we suddenly have gotten a

1329
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,920
somewhat broadly compatible

1330
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,800
very large amount of private address

1331
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,760
space

1332
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,720
that

1333
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,400
if it were officially allocated as

1334
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,599
private address space we would know

1335
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,800
would not collide with other

1336
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,480
ipv4 ranges

1337
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,599
so that's not our top scenario but it is

1338
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,440
something that would be valuable that

1339
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,720
could potentially come out of some of

1340
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,079
the software changes um if they keep

1341
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,560
being made and deployed and tested

1342
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,880
thank you

1343
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,440
take the next question from the online q

1344
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,640
a it's coming to us from blake wills

1345
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,839
how long do you think it would take the

1346
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,760
rirs to run out of these new addresses

1347
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,800
if they started allocating them

1348
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,040
that's a great question

1349
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,599
i almost want to call lee howard back up

1350
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:56,640
and say

1351
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,920
how long do you think it would take them

1352
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,359
to run out because um

1353
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,000
eight years

1354
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,400
eight years my guess is eight

1355
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,760
cool

1356
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,640
well

1357
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,760
um

1358
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,440
i'll say

1359
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,319
lee howard says eight years that's a

1360
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,280
educated informed guest there

1361
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,240
um

1362
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,480
yeah i would love to see more about the

1363
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,200
economic demand and so on but um

1364
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,839
i think that if we're talking about 240

1365
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,359
and that's a pretty large block right if

1366
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,359
we're talking about the individual like

1367
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,119
0 8

1368
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,520
obviously that's

1369
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,839
comparatively

1370
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,558
tiny um

1371
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,800
yeah i wish i had more information i

1372
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,680
would also love to hear from people who

1373
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,040
either are

1374
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,040
the four brokers or who study the

1375
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,599
economics of this

1376
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,680
uh thanks a question from from the mic

1377
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,119
hi uh alex bortick i'm from ixia i have

1378
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,920
a proposal rather than a question um

1379
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,440
the proposal is the following let's

1380
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,680
create a standardized test

1381
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,359
that can be used to

1382
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,800
uh to just routers firewalls switches

1383
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,240
for these blocks

1384
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,280
um there is an uh vendor neutral test

1385
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,839
framework open traffic generator that

1386
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,240
can be done for that

1387
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,319
used for that and then

1388
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,920
from there you can publish results as

1389
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,720
well

1390
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,400
that would be nice to have a repository

1391
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,119
with the test results

1392
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,640
thank you very much for that suggestion

1393
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,720
i will definitely do that i

1394
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,400
did not happen to be familiar with open

1395
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,680
traffic generator

1396
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,760
but i will look it up and submit

1397
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,760
something there yeah i have your email

1398
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,079
so i'll send you the link we can take it

1399
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,119
from there

1400
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,040
yeah thank you very much

1401
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,119
i would love to have that in there

1402
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,400
thank you

1403
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,079
um have time for one more question and

1404
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,640
we'll uh take it online um it's from uh

1405
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,680
matt p tech um thank you for a good talk

1406
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,480
seth you asked about uh permissions you

1407
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,400
have my permission to be making begin

1408
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,440
making these changes

1409
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,839
who else are you needing to get

1410
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,520
permission from to begin rolling out

1411
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,160
these changes

1412
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,720
so i think

1413
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,119
you know one complexity we do

1414
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,280
as one of the earlier questions pointed

1415
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,800
out um

1416
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,480
the linux kernel

1417
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,280
actually made the 240 changes in 2009

1418
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,440
in response to the full earlier acquired

1419
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,119
internet draft

1420
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,480
and

1421
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,520
it's an interesting history right but it

1422
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,240
wasn't adopted as an rfc but people said

1423
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,839
this sounds like a good idea and they

1424
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,040
made the change

1425
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,119
um there are certainly operating system

1426
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,520
vendors we have spoken to

1427
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,880
um

1428
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,319
who

1429
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,240
say

1430
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,680
there's no way we would make this change

1431
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,160
unless it were an rfc

1432
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,280
and

1433
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,240
i've seen the whole gamut

1434
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,680
from

1435
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,440
we already made this change because it

1436
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,359
sounded cool

1437
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,640
to

1438
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,400
you've got to have an rfc it's got to be

1439
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,160
official it's got to be published by

1440
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,520
ietf before we touch this code

1441
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,839
um so i think if we really wanted to

1442
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,280
have

1443
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,359
every actively maintained operating

1444
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,680
system supporting our changes that they

1445
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,400
need to be rfcs from ietf

1446
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,480
um

1447
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,559
if we envision a future which as i said

1448
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,720
is not our most preferred outcome

1449
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,160
in which some of these address ranges

1450
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,319
become official private space

1451
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,440
like the other draft in 2008 proposed

1452
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,319
um

1453
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,240
i really apologize for not remembering

1454
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,319
the author's names often for that draft

1455
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,960
i've read that draft like 30 times but

1456
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,480
the names are slipping my mind

1457
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,359
but

1458
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,160
you know that might be a lower priority

1459
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,359
if it's going to be private address

1460
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,960
space because people could potentially

1461
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,200
say i know that it is suitable for my

1462
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,400
application or i know that it's not

1463
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,839
suitable for my application before

1464
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,440
deciding to use it

1465
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,800
um

1466
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,640
i think there's another interesting

1467
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,640
question about making bgp announcements

1468
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,119
without

1469
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,200
getting people too mad at us

1470
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,880
i think that having some kind of

1471
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,839
internet

1472
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,200
body

1473
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,680
say or take note of these experiments

1474
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,200
would be helpful there

1475
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,680
um we've gotten in touch with people who

1476
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,559
make the um

1477
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,599
reports

1478
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,440
about the

1479
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,960
bogus routes

1480
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,079
to say

1481
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,680
if we're going to do a test can we let

1482
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,720
you know

1483
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,240
that we may be announcing things that

1484
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,680
are officially reserved or that have

1485
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,200
been officially reserved so that you

1486
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,160
don't

1487
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,480
um complain about people who propagate

1488
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,240
those routes during our test

1489
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,160
right but um

1490
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,640
yeah i mean

1491
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,880
anyone who

1492
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,760
if it's the ietf irtf um

1493
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,400
maybe the rir's i think a fascinating

1494
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,240
thing in internet governance is always

1495
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,920
attempting to discover who apparently

1496
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,400
has the authority to officially

1497
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,680
greenlight something um

1498
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,880
i i would like to see iotf or irtf

1499
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,280
um endorsing the idea of some official

1500
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,960
testing but there could be other

1501
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,760
entities that could um

1502
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,520
approve it and take note

1503
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,960
and of course if we're doing official

1504
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,880
testing we will write to

1505
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,040
not lists and say

1506
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,640
you know if you see these things that

1507
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,640
you think are emotions

1508
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,520
it

1509
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,440
may not be like

1510
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,640
something malicious it's our test

1511
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,200
but yeah if there are operators who are

1512
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,800
interested in those tests or who have

1513
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,000
ideas about

1514
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,079
who should either approve them or know

1515
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,359
about them

1516
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,800
please do get in touch with us about

1517
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,160
that because that would also be very

1518
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,720
useful information for us

1519
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,079
thank you again for your presentation

1520
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,640
and time today seth appreciate it

1521
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,240
thank you very much for having me here

1522
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,400
and uh sorry not to be in person and uh

1523
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,480
hope you all have a great rest of the
