1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,390
hi my name is Alexandra Zima fan from

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,150
Yandex and I hope that everybody that is

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:26,259
interested in BGP security have got back

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:31,519
to the room we will not wait for so

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:34,100
speaking about BGP security for years

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,400
there were predictions that BGP can be

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,730
used for with malicious intent BGP can

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,379
be used to intercept your traffic

9
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,779
unfortunately during recent previous

10
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:46,460
years these forecasts came true and

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,790
there were already several successful

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,830
attacks on financial organizations we do

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,479
not know the number the exact number

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,769
because there are some public

15
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,750
information there is some private

16
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:59,059
information and some Phoenician

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,600
organizations are not going to share

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:07,479
that they were hijacked or there in the

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,479
data of their customers was leaked so

20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:15,829
what do we have to fight the intruder

21
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:18,380
so here is the example there was a

22
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:20,839
network that for years was constantly

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,619
hijacking address space from other

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,630
parties and a year ago this activity was

25
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:30,609
finally reported at Nanak mailing list

26
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,320
and in a month these network was foolish

27
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:37,158
disconnected from all its upstream

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,559
providers from access so we the

29
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:44,509
community showed its power it was able

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,880
to disconnect the attacker but does it

31
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:50,030
really scale imagine that we will have

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,869
not one attacker but two attacks three

33
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,960
or four maybe 100 attackers

34
00:01:52,869 --> 00:02:04,670
simultaneously and by the way the attack

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:06,499
was not smart at all so what I'm going

36
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,740
to do I'm going to discuss with you

37
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:11,829
different options that we have to to

38
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:15,410
fight attackers from the technical side

39
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:18,860
so I will be listing these options one

40
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,799
by one some of them are common some of

41
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,200
them are new one and

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,840
then you can even resemble one each

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,010
other so let's start with the first one

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,590
which is should be familiar you should

45
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:37,070
be familiar with it's of course IR

46
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:40,700
filters are filters is a way to

47
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:44,420
translate assets into a list of prefixes

48
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:48,019
that you should apply at your links with

49
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,269
customers so it's just a prefix this is

50
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,870
some kind of critics tree and it's quite

51
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,360
useful so let's see how it's working

52
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,390
this very simple topology I will use it

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,970
during all the slides so and I will

54
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,309
spend a couple of seconds in detail

55
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,670
description of what is going on so here

56
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,840
it is either on system one which which

57
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,820
takes IP transit from our own system to

58
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,970
hearten system 2 and for both take

59
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,609
transit from Alton's system 3 and you

60
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,800
read the slides other system while our

61
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,200
rotten system for will try it best to

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:29,090
hijack address space that belongs to our

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,820
own system 1 so in a simple situation

64
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,190
when there is a root object it belongs

65
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,130
to out on system 1 and out own system

66
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:41,000
for will try to advertise prefix that

67
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:43,100
belongs to our transistor 1 out own

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,680
sister 3 will be able to detect it

69
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,720
because there will be no image with our

70
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,430
our futures which are should be applied

71
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:55,520
between 4 & 3 unfortunately there are a

72
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:58,790
lot of ways to bypass our futures there

73
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,070
is a number of databases that are where

74
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:05,630
you can create root objects without any

75
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:08,030
authorization you can add any any other

76
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,370
organ system in your I set and there is

77
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:16,339
never after ization you can even add

78
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:18,709
google eyes set eyes level 3 and it will

79
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,988
be ok so there is a there is no problem

80
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,380
to bypass IRA futures and most of them

81
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:25,099
are already outdated so what are the

82
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,919
options do we have

83
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,910
so just to summarize our feet our

84
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:35,000
futures are useful they can stop some

85
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,780
mistakes they will help you to secure

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,420
your network

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:42,799
but they are not suitable to fight or

88
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:45,020
malicious activity and if I imagine

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,740
about a bicycle that represents our

90
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,549
futures

91
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:53,600
I will think something like this it's

92
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:57,500
hard it's old but we we have to use it

93
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,230
we have to ride it and let's discuss

94
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:04,160
what other options do we have so the

95
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:06,110
next one is role validation procedure so

96
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,470
I'm not going to discuss applica

97
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:12,910
infrastructure in simplified manner we

98
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:16,010
can think about as applique as a

99
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,920
distributed database of signed objects

100
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:24,550
where you can easily get cash to use it

101
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:28,550
locally so how does it work there is a

102
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:30,890
validation procedure it takes prefix and

103
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:36,050
first account system number in the ice

104
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:39,409
bath and it takes kennedy's roles where

105
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:43,820
there's a prefix overlap with prefix

106
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:49,760
from the road and if the candidates list

107
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:52,040
is not is not empty then it's checked so

108
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,810
that there is an overlap between list of

109
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,280
our own system numbers and the our own

110
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,310
system number in the beginning of the

111
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,619
ice bath if there is an overlap the

112
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,440
outcome is where it is there is no

113
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:07,280
overlap the outcome is invalid so it's

114
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,400
quite simple so how does it work

115
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,169
how does it help the user again let's

116
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,500
imagine that's I take a curve already

117
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:19,730
bypassed I refuge's but now if it will

118
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,040
try to advertise prefix from its own

119
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:25,340
eternal system number it will be

120
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,080
filtered because the prefix the outcome

121
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,440
of role validation procedure will be

122
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:35,599
invaded unfortunately it's not enough to

123
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,700
stop the attacker because it can add our

124
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,020
own system 1 in the beginning of the ice

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:44,360
bath and with this our Constitution

126
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:48,310
system 3 will be forced to accept this

127
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,920
prefix so speaking about rose

128
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:54,500
aking roles are very useful they can be

129
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,080
a revelation procedure can be applied

130
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,420
not only on customer links but also at

131
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,770
links with providers peers

132
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:06,530
so it's reach provides you much more

133
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:10,430
functionality compared to IR filters but

134
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:13,280
without ice path verification or

135
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:19,040
validation it can be used to stop

136
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:23,150
malicious activity and again bicycle for

137
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:27,770
rows we have half of it and we need an

138
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:31,429
opportunity to verify what it is what is

139
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:34,490
in the ice bath and to solve this part

140
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,200
of the problem it was supposed this part

141
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,100
a part of the problem will be covered

142
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:43,659
with BGP say BGP SEC is a quite new

143
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:47,750
protocol it's one in the half-year-old

144
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:51,920
it already has a long history and tones

145
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:54,950
of the documentation it's one week old

146
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:59,540
even a new version of BGP because it has

147
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:01,659
significant changes in the message

148
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:05,660
specification in the ice bath

149
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:08,570
representation and so on so the basic

150
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,780
idea of BGP sag was that the same

151
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:14,680
designs direction direction in which a

152
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:18,710
prefix is sent and so in this case

153
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:22,520
attacker is able to replay ice bath but

154
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:27,080
can't get inside so again we'll get back

155
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:32,150
to the example once again if our own

156
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:34,309
system for will just advertise address

157
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,860
space of outer system one from its own

158
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:42,130
atone system it will be ejected using

159
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:46,160
rolls if it will then try to create a

160
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:49,300
sign signature which will be invalid so

161
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,300
does BGP SEC solves our problems

162
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,550
unfortunately not because the problem is

163
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,370
backward compatibility as I was telling

164
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,109
you BGP SEC is nearly new protocol it

165
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,310
should provide backward compatibility

166
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,820
for all

167
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:07,640
BGP and to bypass BGP sick

168
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:15,080
the attacker needs only one thing do not

169
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:19,460
use BGP SEC so rather easy for from the

170
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:22,640
attacker side and there are the other

171
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,120
problem of BGP SEC is deployment

172
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,660
it has great computational overhead and

173
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,029
so creamy without incremental deployment

174
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:36,620
and so it's bringing you a lot of

175
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:39,230
expenses and gives very little back and

176
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,029
if you ask again comparing protocols

177
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:46,060
with bicycles it will be something like

178
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:52,100
this it has fantastic design but brings

179
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:53,630
nothing then additional complexity so it

180
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,710
sounds strange with the timer the same

181
00:09:53,630 --> 00:10:00,650
thing ok

182
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:04,400
no nevermind let's speak about another

183
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:07,490
mechanism that was before a competitor

184
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:14,530
of BGP second even was introduced before

185
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:16,910
a PK so it was called so BGP so BGP was

186
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,760
suggesting to use instead of strong

187
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:24,459
cryptographic cryptographic a validation

188
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:28,250
verification using external database so

189
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:31,850
high speed was supposed to say to least

190
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:36,290
I add a high speed they are connected

191
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:38,570
with if if there is a both can both

192
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,819
ordered pairs exist

193
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,850
the pay is trustable if only one pair

194
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:49,250
exist the pair is not invalid it's just

195
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:52,730
less trustable so the result is that so

196
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,370
BGP was providing a solution that gives

197
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,760
clear statement invalid or valid it was

198
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:01,630
providing a function function that at a

199
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,640
high adoption rate may be useful but

200
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,760
again it can easily abused by attackers

201
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,910
especially at state of record adoption

202
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,620
another problem is access access prefer

203
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,319
to say then that they are not

204
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,199
participating in routing

205
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,160
this position is arguable but it happens

206
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:23,410
unfortunately and transparent access are

207
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,189
not aiding the eternal system a number

208
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:31,199
in the path

209
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:34,410
so with these indirect agencies there is

210
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,689
impossible to create such a database and

211
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:42,639
there's another option for attackers so

212
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:46,029
as a result a solo BGP is a function

213
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,250
it's capable to detect Boggan routes but

214
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:52,029
it's not capable to detect a route leaks

215
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:57,279
or is not capable to provide a general

216
00:11:52,029 --> 00:12:02,589
solution to verify I spot and behind all

217
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:05,829
its disadvantages so BGP had at least

218
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:09,149
one bright idea verification which is

219
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:14,469
done outside of BGP protocol itself is

220
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:21,399
much is less costly than cryptographic

221
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:26,019
validation and so anyway we're here at

222
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:28,029
the moment there is no mechanism that

223
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:31,000
can save us from malicious activity

224
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:33,819
there are several mechanisms that are

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:41,199
designed to detect mistakes had nothing

226
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:44,229
to detect hacker activity so but we

227
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:46,870
should accept it and move forward from a

228
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,060
forward to nu which be extension new BGP

229
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:53,170
solution which which will finally solve

230
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:55,869
our goals because otherwise we will be

231
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,939
doomed to fight attackers using medical

232
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:02,079
East I don't think this is acceptable

233
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:04,750
for the community so let's specify the

234
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,979
goals because a properly specified goals

235
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:11,529
may bring us a solution we need to stop

236
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,770
propagation of malicious hijacks and

237
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:17,670
release we need to

238
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:19,860
gutter ball situations the technique

239
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,620
should support incremental deployment

240
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,170
should be a lightweight it should not

241
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,600
should not require significant updates

242
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,979
in the BGP protocol itself and of course

243
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,710
it should ensure it should provide

244
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:36,570
automatic fully automatic solution so

245
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,760
let's speak about how anomalies are

246
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,770
propagating is there any difference

247
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,170
between propagating normal prefix or

248
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,740
hijack prefix of course not

249
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:50,760
it's propagates to upstream providers to

250
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:54,240
peers and then to downstream and if we

251
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:57,569
will be able to detect this propagation

252
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,560
at the level of links between customers

253
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:05,510
and providers and peers we are done so

254
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:09,479
we can simplify the work instead of

255
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:12,180
making go to verify all ice baths in the

256
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,100
world it's enough to verify ice baths

257
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,250
for prefixes that I received from

258
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:21,840
customers and peers and there is another

259
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:24,230
beautiful note for this for prefixes

260
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,990
that I received from customers and peers

261
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,810
all pairs of different item system

262
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:35,570
numbers in the path must be customer and

263
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:38,489
proper to provide so what we need is a

264
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,330
distributed database of scienter objects

265
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,680
that will say that this is my providers

266
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:48,120
and here we are getting to a poker game

267
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:52,020
so what we are suggesting is a and you

268
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,680
applica object that will give ispeed an

269
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:58,890
opportunity to list their providers with

270
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,250
this object it will be it will enable

271
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:08,580
others piece to detect a hacker activity

272
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:10,470
for for the address space so here is an

273
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:17,700
example so there is a customer account

274
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:20,940
system that signs who is its provide the

275
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:25,050
paper the verification procedure is very

276
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,980
similar to role brief occasion so again

277
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:30,010
we're separating we

278
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,360
splitting ice but in two pairs where

279
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:34,600
prepend values I ignored

280
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,370
after that we are for a pair for each

281
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,130
pair we are retrieving candidates in

282
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:41,769
space if the list is not empty we're

283
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:45,970
checking is if there is an overlap if

284
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:47,860
there is no overlap then the outcome

285
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:51,720
will be invalid if there is an overlap

286
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:55,540
the outcome will be valid just as rows

287
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,480
so let's see how it's helped once again

288
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,880
if our own system for will advertise

289
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:06,040
prefix from its own a consistent number

290
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:09,040
it will be detected using rows now if it

291
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,319
it will try to add our own system while

292
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,360
in the beginning of this part it will be

293
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,029
detected because houghton system one

294
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,430
have authorized only our own system to

295
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:25,060
to send its prefixes to upstream

296
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:28,380
provides it may get so I auto system for

297
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:31,719
me then try to add after new system to

298
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:34,360
to the eyes path again it will be

299
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,760
detected because out of system to have

300
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,980
ultralight authorized only our own

301
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,709
sister 3 to send these prefixes to

302
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:44,470
option providers the last chance is to

303
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:47,439
remove out own system for from the ice

304
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,139
path at all but according to the

305
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,220
specification at the router must check

306
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:56,940
that the neighbor out own systems system

307
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:01,209
number is present in the highest path

308
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:03,760
here is the result user always wins or

309
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:06,159
at least nearly always there is still a

310
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,520
are the only opportunity for an attacker

311
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,860
is to be your provider

312
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,459
this is the last limitation but it is a

313
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:19,119
very unlikely this a person or a legal

314
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:24,910
entity that you have that which which

315
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:27,760
you that have a contractual agreement

316
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,380
with you will start are taking you and

317
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,179
hijacking your address space I suppose

318
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:36,620
that you will break such contractual

319
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:41,070
agreement in a very little time

320
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:45,209
so they speak it's very simple it's

321
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:49,260
works for both hijacks and aerobics it's

322
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:52,140
for both malicious and mistakes

323
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:57,110
it doesn't require any changes in the

324
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:59,519
BGP protocol it's the basics on

325
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:02,639
application for structure which must be

326
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:08,460
slightly updated and of course it works

327
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:11,580
only also at the stage of adoption and

328
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:16,500
here is how the our see huge quadrant

329
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:20,269
may look one day here's the how drafts

330
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:24,899
they are ready published and adopted by

331
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:27,120
psy drops working group there is a list

332
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:30,000
of authors and it is actively working on

333
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,870
these drafts but this technology will

334
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,570
not work without your support because

335
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:40,408
BGP security or insecurity is our joint

336
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:43,260
effort you should do your part of the

337
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:46,850
work you should integrate rows you

338
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:50,370
should sign it yeah you should push

339
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,469
IRA's because I became infrastructure

340
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:56,100
favorite clearly relies on IRS

341
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:58,679
infrastructure and for example as you're

342
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:04,668
all know Aaron is slightly behind in

343
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:07,649
this process at the moment here we are

344
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:11,850
this is possible future it is a simple

345
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:18,149
one where we maybe we're BGP routing

346
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:21,120
will be secured it's a we uncharged to

347
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:22,678
decide will it happen or we will still

348
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,030
solve the problems in the Middle East

349
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,170
thank you for listening

350
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:30,879
[Applause]

351
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,880
[Music]

352
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:46,830
any questions hi okay

353
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:50,790
hi my name is Prakash crime from a five

354
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:54,510
silver line and I have a question about

355
00:19:50,790 --> 00:20:09,230
the solution that you proposed here is

356
00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:09,230
there an option to be also as I have

357
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:34,110
yeah why I am asking because we have a

358
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:37,040
solution that we call an origination in

359
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:41,010
this situation some of our customers

360
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,950
want asked to advertise their prefixes

361
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,140
as we are the originals for such a

362
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:50,010
situation that we have to create two

363
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:52,590
database entries for the a pka or can we

364
00:20:50,010 --> 00:21:00,660
as a provide a solicit provider be also

365
00:20:52,590 --> 00:21:03,570
a origin is in one entry for for

366
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,880
prefixes may belong to your customers

367
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:10,740
you don't create anything except a stay

368
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,460
like for your own address space so SB

369
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:16,110
it's not the prefix it's been system

370
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,250
number and in your case it will be

371
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:27,479
working from box okay okay thank you

372
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:30,480
very much Nimrod Levy AT&T I just wanted

373
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,760
to first thank you for for pushing this

374
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,670
thing these these proposals through this

375
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,890
is very very good technology to help

376
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,020
improve the routing in the internet and

377
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,789
I wanted to make one clarification that

378
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:46,399
there are in fact trends

379
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:50,158
providers filtering on Roiz yeah and

380
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:51,959
spies I remember 18 t is dropping well

381
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,600
it's already from its least up from

382
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,239
years that's correct yeah and it's great

383
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,158
news and I hope other T ones will join

384
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,999
this party yeah and if there are any

385
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,549
questions on that

386
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:04,649
that anybody wants to talk about what

387
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:06,149
we've experienced in that regard I'm

388
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:09,570
happy to have those conversations as

389
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:11,939
well yeah I just want to highlight one

390
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:15,989
more time it's important you just charge

391
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,700
at least considering using raw original

392
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:18,989
Edition inside whenever there are

393
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,659
already several open source

394
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:23,580
implementations I know at least three

395
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:27,840
from right from CloudFlare and from any

396
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,559
labs that can be used inside your

397
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,139
network and you need to understand that

398
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,178
ace Bay will be easily integrated on top

399
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:40,709
of this infrastructure it's you

400
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:43,019
innovating one time and when the ACE

401
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:48,659
bail will be on fly you will be it will

402
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:51,109
be much easier to integrate it any other

403
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,109
questions

404
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:59,099
so thank you very much thank you for

405
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:00,040
suffering from my Russian accent and see

406
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:07,220
you around
