1
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,890
hello everyone my name is Bert makovski

2
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,349
and I'm

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:25,579
work engineer working at the Amsterdam

4
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:29,840
internet exchange today's presentation

5
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:31,680
was done with max Jericho but

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:39,559
unfortunately he couldn't be with us

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:42,980
here today all right

8
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:42,980
the outline

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:53,150
jumping to the next sorry alright a

10
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,269
couple of facts about Amsterdam internet

11
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:59,260
exchange we are a non-profit neutral and

12
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:04,059
independent exchange based in Amsterdam

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:10,360
right around 14 datacenters with over

14
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:20,869
850 years ends with a traffic of above

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:24,830
66.6 terabits this year we 25 years old

16
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:35,509
so we had a small celebration working

17
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:38,869
with 56 people presenting our platform

18
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:41,240
it's a MPLS VPS Bates peering platform

19
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:47,360
with two Allah's peace between each pair

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:53,048
of access switches over to be routers we

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,049
have 10g energy access switch resilience

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:10,639
this button so internationally we are

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:14,049
having six separate ISPs with over 900

24
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:20,690
part is connected present in over 500

25
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:25,550
collocations in 350 cities so coming

26
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:31,310
back to the subject I would like to talk

27
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:35,270
about the am-6 management network and in

28
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:38,290
short our management network is internal

29
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,940
am-6 network which interconnects our

30
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,420
infrastructure including production

31
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,470
switches DW DMS photonic cross connect

32
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,839
devices etc it's being used for a

33
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,910
managing of our production platform

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,430
switches and also for collecting

35
00:02:52,910 --> 00:03:01,269
customer statistics as well as as flow

36
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:04,930
data so it should be extremely reliable

37
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:10,100
since our monitoring system relies

38
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:14,690
solidly on it also when you are visiting

39
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:21,560
our websites you are going through the

40
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:23,930
management network so what kind of

41
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,400
issues that we see with our old

42
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,390
management network and a couple of plain

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,090
facts about it

44
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:37,880
so in Amsterdam we do have we did have

45
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:43,180
22 switches which were located in 40

46
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,180
datacenters plus one in our main office

47
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:52,130
on our small remote locations we had 10

48
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,410
switches in total and historically our

49
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,320
management network grew over the years

50
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,720
where we were adding set side by side

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,980
and

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,430
that's why we had a mix of different

53
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:09,940
playing their two devices from brocade

54
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:12,570
and still old foundry switches we used

55
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:18,790
also the ring topology in our setup and

56
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:25,000
a couple of disadvantages that we had

57
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:27,100
with it a couple of times we experienced

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,960
looping our management of network

59
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:36,250
because the devices did not support any

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:42,010
look prevention mechanism we had also

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:48,790
partially isolated parts of our network

62
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:51,340
due to a double captain fibers we have

63
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,220
some some MRP issues were some of the

64
00:04:51,340 --> 00:05:00,010
parts didn't recover after flapping we

65
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:02,560
did have also bandwidth bottlenecks some

66
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:06,610
of the devices were end of light and end

67
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,720
of support and another important factor

68
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:15,729
is that as you could see at our previous

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,680
slide we had three MRP rings where every

70
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:22,240
fiber between the switches was a

71
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,290
separate that fiber that we were paying

72
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,290
for every month

73
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,609
[Music]

74
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:37,600
so as you can see here we were using 30

75
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,440
duct fibers for our production Network

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:46,460
and besides this 17 additional for our

77
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:49,550
management network so what we thought is

78
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:54,919
to reuse the existing production dark

79
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:57,260
fibers with DWDM boxes and in this way

80
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,450
we were able to build a fully redundant

81
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:14,810
spine lift topology for our new

82
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:17,060
management and work so as I said and

83
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,850
mentioned the fact scene about our

84
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:26,060
network in the past and the design

85
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:28,760
features the advantages that we had we

86
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:32,660
needed to upgrade we wanted to make our

87
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:38,390
environment more homogeneous to have the

88
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:40,460
same hardware and software and it was it

89
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:44,150
got hard during the time to manage

90
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:49,729
different devices on the network sorwe

91
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:52,429
aim was to make it more unified the new

92
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:55,340
devices would also bring more capacity

93
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,320
for our internal cloud and more

94
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,859
redundancy to avoid new people and

95
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:06,639
switches our relations we encountered

96
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:09,770
before so the question is where to go

97
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,580
which technology brand software and

98
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,370
hardware to use and

99
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,400
as you might know 10 years ago we didn't

100
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,430
have so many options but but as you can

101
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,400
see nowadays it's kind of a puzzle to

102
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:28,180
solve for choosing most suitable model

103
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:32,950
for our network we made some research

104
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:34,300
and a couple of proof of concepts of the

105
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:44,130
modern technologies and different

106
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:47,080
vendors as always m6 try to be at the

107
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:51,460
networking edge and we decided to go

108
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,950
with future-proof option and choose

109
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:59,039
Burton parameters which is with one of

110
00:07:53,950 --> 00:08:01,060
the third-party software vendors what is

111
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,180
very metal iPod

112
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:07,950
concept it's basically in decoupling

113
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:11,500
software from hardware on the devices so

114
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:14,320
buying switch without operating system

115
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,020
and in studying later anything that you

116
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,300
can find on the market there are a

117
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,370
couple of software companies like

118
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,620
pluribus Komodos mix which type in

119
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:29,650
fusion and so on you can buy and install

120
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:33,370
the software from them and install it

121
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:39,449
like on a server or yeah you can also go

122
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,450
with open switch which is a free project

123
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:49,779
so introducing color choice after

124
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:53,149
looking into the technology and making

125
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:56,029
proof of concepts of course we went for

126
00:08:53,149 --> 00:09:02,930
the very boost network solution with the

127
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:07,519
as 4048 only enabled switches so it gave

128
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:10,120
us some useful features like the CMP

129
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:15,470
look prevention that we were looking for

130
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:20,209
the rest api bx lam and their

131
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:27,160
proprietary fabric design so talking

132
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:32,719
about fabric concept let's look for the

133
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,879
classic switch plane approach so here we

134
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,180
can see a classic design of the switch

135
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:40,220
that we are all used to on the bottom we

136
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,699
have data plane and then control plane

137
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:49,839
and on the top segment single management

138
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:53,660
plane a pair switch with the new

139
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,939
solution the data and control plane for

140
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:59,269
the underlay of each switch stays the

141
00:09:55,939 --> 00:10:02,509
same like classic design but the

142
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:05,569
management plane in common is in common

143
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:08,209
for every switch in the fabric all the

144
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:10,579
switches in the fabric federate together

145
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:12,489
in a peer-to-peer fashion for

146
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:15,469
distributed anciano

147
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:17,839
implementation practically saying

148
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:21,350
average switch is still independent but

149
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,350
you can log in and see configure any

150
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:28,939
switch from any switch you are connected

151
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:32,259
to you can add a nice yell and will be

152
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:33,849
populated to all the switches gives you

153
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:36,979
ease of use

154
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,979
[Music]

155
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:46,370
so a little bit background on how does

156
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:50,430
it work

157
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:52,050
each book establishes basically a TCP

158
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,890
management connection to every other

159
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,770
books every box has a microsd in

160
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:01,199
controller and the state database to

161
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:04,520
track the state of all other switches in

162
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:09,090
the fabric and this works well over

163
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:11,840
geographically distributed sites because

164
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:18,240
there is no central control

165
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:22,680
so if effectively it looks like one

166
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:27,800
programmable entity and the system

167
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,800
automatically builds the excellent mesh

168
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,050
the network operating system in addition

169
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,330
to running standard protocols in the

170
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:45,719
underlay establishes also we expand

171
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:49,650
overlay with V tabs terminated in

172
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:53,550
hardware on the switch the VX land

173
00:11:49,650 --> 00:12:02,340
tunnels are auto created and establish a

174
00:11:53,550 --> 00:12:04,469
full batch of tunnels try to represent

175
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,650
it how it looks from inside of the

176
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,650
device

177
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,510
earlier versions of bare-metal switches

178
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:15,960
there are indeed two different boards

179
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:21,630
one is switch with an ascii and another

180
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:24,630
on the top is Intel Atom on board some

181
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:28,439
of them even a VGA connector hood on the

182
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:31,500
switch in pluribus ocean there is i2

183
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,670
Linux installed which controls the box

184
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,200
itself and Broadcom ASCII an internal

185
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,620
API

186
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:44,700
there is also an Alexa container with

187
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:47,820
quagga installed on it for BGP OSPF so

188
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:52,940
this is how I tried to with visualize

189
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,940
how the ultimen l3 communication works

190
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,630
[Music]

191
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,579
one important feature that we were

192
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:04,010
looking for was the ability to connect

193
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:07,250
critical infrastructure as our mass

194
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:09,660
production web servers to two switches

195
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:13,830
simultaneously to avoid any downtime in

196
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:16,170
gate in case of maintenance or a failure

197
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,780
of one of the devices

198
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:22,890
this requires creation of a cluster

199
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:26,839
between switches where we want to

200
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:30,780
connect to MC lock unaware devices and

201
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:34,050
on the top you can also see spine

202
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:37,829
cluster to connect non v excellence

203
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:40,490
which and on the bottom leaf connecting

204
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,490
it to the server

205
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:51,700
so in the end we have built a spinal

206
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:55,990
leaf topology network for our management

207
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:59,200
use get geographically distributed

208
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,010
fabric we built over the standard SPF

209
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:06,040
underlay

210
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:09,280
it's loop free there is no controller no

211
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:17,040
speed brain scenario and slack for

212
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:21,880
critical services improve visibility and

213
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:30,219
our experience is a simple management of

214
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:32,370
our management network so far thank you

215
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,370
any questions

216
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,139
yeah question did you just use the

217
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,720
underlying

218
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:10,410
dwdm transport to establish a point but

219
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:14,230
you DWM TWD and transport is still

220
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:21,279
physically a ring what did you do

221
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:25,689
so we reused the colors on our DWDM

222
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:37,089
voxels yeah to come up with its finally

223
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:45,779
architecture yes okay like I guess

224
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:49,329
related to that so double cut basically

225
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:53,459
yes we do have a spine and leaf and it

226
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,459
goes to two separate collocations

227
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,320
all right thank you very much

228
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,040
[Applause]

229
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,060
you
