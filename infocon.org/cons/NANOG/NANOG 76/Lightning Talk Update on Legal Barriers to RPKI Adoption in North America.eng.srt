1
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,649
hi everyone thanks for sticking around

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,900
for the Wednesday lightning talks I'm

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,060
David wish Nick I am an academic fellow

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,490
at the University of Pennsylvania Law

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,619
School Center for technology innovation

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,240
and competition don't run out of the

7
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:29,810
room because I said Law School I'm

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,459
talking about rpki which is a technical

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,339
topic but it has some legal elements to

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,350
it so I'm presenting an update on some

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,180
work that I've been doing with

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,850
Christopher you who couldn't be here

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,860
today and we are funded by the National

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,120
Science Foundation you can see the award

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,710
number down at the bottom if you want to

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,919
go check out the details in the public

17
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:51,199
record so what I'm going to do today is

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,309
just describe a little bit about our

19
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,900
project where we've been coming from and

20
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:59,900
then give an update on where things

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:05,509
stand with potential legal barriers to

22
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:07,010
rpki adoption in North America so for

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,080
those who don't know I'll give a really

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,960
brief background on rpki it is a two

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,990
sided framework to secure routing tables

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,030
and what people do is if they hold IP

27
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,369
addresses they can create certificates

28
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,470
that identify authentic IP address

29
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,620
origins so it's origin validation not

30
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:27,440
route validation once you su a route

31
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,930
origin authorization or OA other people

32
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,890
who are running networks can then

33
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,510
validate routes based on those rows and

34
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,280
decide how to treat them in their

35
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:41,450
routing table so two sided framework

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,770
signing and validation now the last

37
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,150
twelve months have been quite eventful

38
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,759
for rpki

39
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:51,800
let's see so beginning in July MTT began

40
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:56,030
combining rpki information with irr data

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,649
to improve some of their filtering some

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,640
good things some bad things in August

43
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:04,310
2018 Amazon DNS was hijacked later in

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,930
2018 CloudFlare committed to rpki and

45
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,979
they began developing their own route

46
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:12,620
validator called octo rpki and let's see

47
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,450
in February 20 19 18 T began filtering

48
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,030
routes Google is doing similar things

49
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,690
and over a hundred networks have joined

50
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,250
I Sox manners

51
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,770
mutually agreed norms for routing

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,300
security so we're at perhaps something

53
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,650
of an inflection point in terms of

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,430
buy-in on rpki

55
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,800
in North America on the other hand if

56
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,690
you look at some of the figures from the

57
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,030
worldwide perspective you can see that

58
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,700
the North American region is not doing

59
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,400
as well especially as ripe and aap Nick

60
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,679
that's on both signing and validation so

61
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,290
on the signing side this graph is not

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,370
perfect it's but you can see the the

63
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,109
blue line represents Aaron in terms of

64
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,489
percentage of declared ipv4 space

65
00:02:52,110 --> 00:03:00,569
covered by rows now that blue line is

66
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:02,880
well below ripe and below lakh Nick and

67
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,500
below a peanut but as you can see in the

68
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:10,140
past few months there's been a decided

69
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:12,660
uptick in terms of row issuance now the

70
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,399
problem that may in fact be a bigger

71
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,980
problem is that people who then issue

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,870
those rows might want people who are

73
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,640
doing validation to validate based on

74
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,260
those rows

75
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,690
unfortunately in 2018 a researcher named

76
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,519
Ben Cartwright Cox found that 80% of

77
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,100
people who are engaging in ROV

78
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,799
at the time that he looked into it were

79
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,720
omitting the Aaron tau that may have

80
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,959
changed since then but that is a that's

81
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,510
a disheartening number from 2018 so

82
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,459
what's what's the problem one hypothesis

83
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,250
that was kicked around a couple of years

84
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,900
ago at Nanog in fact was that there were

85
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,630
some legal barriers that were specific

86
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,130
to the North American region and what

87
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,660
Christopher you and I have been doing

88
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,700
over the past year and a half or so is

89
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,590
looking into that hypothesis trying to

90
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,108
kick the tires we interviewed a lot of

91
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,700
you we got a lot of feedback trying to

92
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,410
piece together what are the legal

93
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,010
barriers and how might they be addressed

94
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,290
so you know there were reports and

95
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,140
people was specifically focused on an

96
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,730
indemnification clause in Aaron's

97
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,589
contract called the relying party

98
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,500
agreement which is what people have to

99
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,630
agree to if they're going to engage in

100
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,500
validation using the Aaron trust Anchor

101
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,570
locator so that was the hypothesis what

102
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,640
did we do to kick to figure out whether

103
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,030
that was true or not we analyzed a lot

104
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,370
of legal materials contract

105
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,320
policies court cases we interviewed a

106
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,910
lot of stakeholders and we engaged with

107
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,790
people in the Aaron and Anna community

108
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,850
over over a number of meetings trying to

109
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,040
really understand things we made some

110
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,020
presentations and again I really want to

111
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,360
reiterate how helpful everybody was who

112
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,969
we reached out to for interviews within

113
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,100
this community we also released a report

114
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,040
in December 2018 you can read it at this

115
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,570
annoyingly complex link which will be

116
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,660
posted on the nanite website or you can

117
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,940
email me for a fresh copy and then we

118
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,919
presented at Aaron 43 and so one of the

119
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,900
things that our report had is a bunch of

120
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,729
recommendations for what the North

121
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,070
American routing community might want to

122
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:12,940
do to address some of the salient legal

123
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:16,150
issues and Aaron has been quite

124
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:19,510
receptive to the report and at Aaron 43

125
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,280
there was a discussion Christopher you

126
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,580
my colleague presented John Curran

127
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,200
presented on the topic and the upshot is

128
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,479
that Aaron is committed to conducting a

129
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,300
full review of their contractual

130
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,950
policies having to do with rpki

131
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,540
likely to conclude by the end of 2019

132
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:40,659
commenters at Aaron 43 in Barbados

133
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,600
encouraged swift action and indeed one

134
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,520
commenter said if you want to increase

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,169
my fees you're welcome to I don't know

136
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,599
if everybody agrees with that but just

137
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,349
reporting one one person's view on that

138
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,900
topic

139
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,580
it's about any rate the key takeaway

140
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,739
here is that there is a lot of interest

141
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,560
in this and there's dialogue going on

142
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,580
that Aaron is quite involved with and as

143
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,919
a member driven community

144
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:07,210
you all should you know feel free to

145
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:09,010
reach out to to Aaron and to you know be

146
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,469
a participant in this dialogue going

147
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:14,050
forward so that's the procedure of

148
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,700
what's going on what's the substance I'm

149
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,360
gonna go through this at a very high

150
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,340
level you can read all 35 pages of our

151
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,500
report if you want or like the three

152
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,690
executive summary pages maybe that's

153
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,270
more you know that might be a little

154
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:30,610
easier but at any rate the key

155
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,469
high-level issues the first one has to

156
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,210
do with acceptance of the relying party

157
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,919
agreement going into the past few months

158
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,340
there's been a difference between how

159
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,969
you access the towel for

160
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,739
the other four are IRS and for Aaron

161
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,330
that's because in or in the u.s. in

162
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,190
order to get a binding contract you need

163
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,760
to have some sort of manifestation of a

164
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:55,620
sent click a little box or you see in

165
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,930
your visual field something that says

166
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,540
there's a contract here you're hereby

167
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,870
aware and you're going through our web

168
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,670
page you'll be bound by this that is not

169
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,710
something that the other our IRS have

170
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,690
demanded but it's something that Aaron

171
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,060
has felt necessary based on the US legal

172
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,340
environment so one of the key things

173
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,400
that is perceived to be holding back

174
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,900
adoption is that that difference which

175
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,200
makes it hard to automate the download

176
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,090
of the Aaron tell also there are some in

177
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,690
dem there are some clauses in the our PA

178
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,250
that people have have suggested are

179
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,890
holding back their organizations from

180
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:35,010
participating in our PKI one of those

181
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,990
has to do with indemnification so you

182
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,150
know those are the key issues what what

183
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,010
did we recommend in our report we really

184
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,840
went through a couple of scenarios that

185
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,030
and we think Aaron should be considering

186
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,310
right now one of them is elimination of

187
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,739
the RP RP a altogether that would

188
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,390
obviously allow software developers to

189
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,400
automate the download of the air Intel

190
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,210
without any contract there would be no

191
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,359
contract anymore

192
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,320
now we think that's a reasonable path we

193
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,630
also think that there are other

194
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,219
reasonable paths one of which is to

195
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,460
consider dropping the indemnification

196
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,500
clause and replacing it or retaining

197
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,680
what's known as an as is disclaimer that

198
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,630
would allocate liability in a way that's

199
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,670
maybe less onerous on the user than the

200
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,370
indemnification clause there are lots of

201
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:20,310
puts and takes to this topic it's

202
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:23,760
complex and both paths are reasonable by

203
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,440
our lights but they and they you know

204
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,110
fall out in different ways in terms of

205
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,950
who's advantaged and who is able to do

206
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,289
what they want with with the air in town

207
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:36,569
now another idea we floated is the

208
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:40,620
creation of a new nonprofit that would

209
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,630
be in charge of distributing the the

210
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,570
rows and the materials you get through

211
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,430
the air Intel now that I don't know

212
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,470
whether that is gaining traction or not

213
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,540
it's maybe a little bit out there of a

214
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,220
solution but you could imagine

215
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,199
organization that doesn't have the other

216
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,690
functions that Aaron has taking a

217
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:59,279
different approach to how they view

218
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,430
liability that they're trying to protect

219
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,889
through contract lastly we suggested

220
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,540
that it would be useful to encourage

221
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:09,089
people to integrate acceptance of the

222
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,730
RPA into validator software rather than

223
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:14,100
having to send people on their own to

224
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,699
the Aaron website to get the to get the

225
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:22,050
towel now I'm happy to report that Rudin

226
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:25,709
800 dot 4.0 is doing that right now

227
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,620
and Aaron is open to anybody who wants

228
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:30,449
to build software that automates well

229
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,480
now other than puts it in the workflow

230
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:36,479
for getting getting a routing validator

231
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,910
software up and running to put it in

232
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,949
that and very very similarly what you

233
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,240
see in this workflow right here which

234
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:44,519
says if you agree to the agreement

235
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,139
please run the command now that's a lot

236
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,699
easier and a lot quicker than having to

237
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:50,399
go to the Aaron website and get things

238
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:53,910
going that way not everybody's satisfied

239
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,519
that by that it does it still is a

240
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,130
roadblock of a sort in the process but I

241
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,870
think that it's great that Aaron has

242
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,910
made that possible and that the

243
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,389
team-building route inator has put that

244
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,790
into practice so what are the other

245
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:11,160
issues another issue is in the RP a

246
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,250
there is a clause called the prohibited

247
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,240
conduct clause that prohibits the

248
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,209
distribution of machine readable

249
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,069
information about rpki

250
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:21,930
now you can imagine a lot of really

251
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:23,610
useful reasons why you might want to

252
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,689
distribute machine readable information

253
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,029
about rpki

254
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:30,029
analysis for research you might even

255
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:32,790
want to use it for real-time routing and

256
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:35,069
filtering like MTT is combining rpki

257
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,660
information with IRR information people

258
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:38,550
might have creative ways of using this

259
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,089
and wanting to do some machine readable

260
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:44,939
transfer of information in real time my

261
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:47,730
sense and and John can can correct me if

262
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:51,180
I'm wrong is that Aaron is open to uses

263
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:54,990
of this that are responsible and that

264
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,660
don't impose safety concerns and risks

265
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,340
on the use of rpki information so if

266
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,880
you're interested in doing that kind of

267
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:05,130
thing I think it would be sensible to

268
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,380
shoot an email Darren the one of the big

269
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,000
takeaway like the global take away from

270
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:13,560
Christopher and my work over the past

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,920
year and change is that dialogue and

272
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,560
reaching out to organizations that are

273
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,839
here to support the community would move

274
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,030
things forward and so if you have gripes

275
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,490
about legal things like that good to get

276
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,260
your team involved maybe check in with

277
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,880
the lawyers the organization reach out

278
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,140
to Aaron and try to build some dialogue

279
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,630
I think that we're seeing progress

280
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:37,319
because that dialogue is moving forward

281
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:40,410
right now so another recommendation we

282
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,500
made is if you are buying anything that

283
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,630
has any adjacency to routing think about

284
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,310
putting the use of rpki

285
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,720
in your procurement requirements that

286
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,699
would build a network effect to get

287
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,590
signing invalidation off the ground in

288
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,960
north america

289
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,390
lastly publicize information about best

290
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,450
practices reach out to manners learn how

291
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,410
to do this that is a way to get this

292
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,900
thing off the ground

293
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,819
legal issues might hold everybody up but

294
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,579
it's going to be tech deployment that

295
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,280
gets rpki going and to that end

296
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,460
deployment of best practices there are

297
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,780
our FCS on this useful to do it more

298
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,420
important to do it right and to do it

299
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,819
safely so especially for failover and

300
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,770
solicit advice from people and our IRS

301
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,300
also should be following best practices

302
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:28,140
in making disclosures about service

303
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,990
levels so engage Aaron should can be

304
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,310
considering the RP a changes right now

305
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,830
and the Aaron community should really

306
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,540
consider some of these recommendations

307
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,580
and should be engaging in dialogue as

308
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,510
this review that the erendor is

309
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,880
undertaking is going on and with that

310
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,290
I'd like to open it up for questions if

311
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,900
anybody has questions on this topic

312
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,770
happy to answer them and maybe engage in

313
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,770
some dialogue right here

314
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:02,850
hi my name is Ross can you explain what

315
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,470
the relying party agreement is and why

316
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,950
people would not want to agree to that

317
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,630
sure I'm sorry that I didn't give a

318
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,580
high-level description of the relying

319
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,100
party agreement up front so it is the

320
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:18,290
agreement that binds people who are

321
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,370
downloading the repository of Roiz and

322
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:24,240
certificates and things like that

323
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:26,640
through access to the towel I think John

324
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,290
may have some close enough for rock and

325
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,819
roll okay yeah so so the agreement that

326
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,939
you have to enter into in order to gain

327
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,430
access to the materials you get through

328
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,190
the air until now people might not want

329
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,620
to bind themselves to it because you

330
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,470
some people as organisations don't allow

331
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,670
them to agree to indemnification clauses

332
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,890
if you encounter an identification

333
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,569
clause then you as a person who's

334
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,010
considering signing that contract can't

335
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,709
do it under your organisation's rules

336
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:57,510
other people may not know what's in it

337
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:01,949
and may feel uncomfortable clicking

338
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:06,120
through it people may just not want to

339
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:08,940
on philosophical grounds agree to terms

340
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,470
and conditions on something like rpki

341
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,240
which is supposed to have very

342
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,930
widespread deployment so there all sorts

343
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,209
of reasons and you know an organisation

344
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,069
like Aaron has to balance which of those

345
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,989
they credit in which of those they don't

346
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,520
and people have to internally within

347
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,040
their own organisations figure out what

348
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,360
their policies are in terms of those

349
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,360
types of agreements and there's a big

350
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,750
thing in open source as well is that

351
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:37,050
helpful yeah thank you sure

352
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,910
hi I'm Scott do these same restrictions

353
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:48,810
apply and are these same problems

354
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:50,730
evident is it still relevant what you're

355
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,119
talking about so I think that that would

356
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:57,089
be covered by the registration services

357
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,970
agreement that Aaron has and that also

358
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:02,129
has very similar terms but everybody

359
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,660
who's running a network and who's a

360
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:06,509
member of Aaron has already signed on to

361
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,189
that contract so rubber doesn't meet the

362
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:12,199
road in the same way okay thank you

363
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:15,060
mm-hmm I I can speak to that

364
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:17,040
Rob see strim I'm on the air in advisory

365
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,410
council I'm speaking only for myself

366
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,689
here but I'm gonna limit my commentary

367
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,180
to the technical aspects of this this

368
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:26,879
there are two halves of our PKI and you

369
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,008
need to separate them in your mind the

370
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,329
registration services agreement is

371
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:37,410
coupled with your ability to issue Roiz

372
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:40,219
and whether you run your own you're self

373
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:44,069
hosted or whether you do the hosted

374
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:48,240
validator with Aaron is orthogonal to

375
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:53,370
the question of validating the other

376
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,949
people's Roiz and the discussion here

377
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,050
has been centered around the relying

378
00:15:55,949 --> 00:16:02,219
party agreement which you need to get

379
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:04,199
the towel from Aaron which is it's like

380
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,019
the trust anchor that's in your web

381
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:10,199
browsers that says I believe Symantec

382
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:12,540
certs or I believe Komodo or whatever

383
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:16,079
it's it's what allows you to validate

384
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:19,740
other people's announcements so split

385
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:25,138
that into two halves thank you okay

386
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:27,199
thanks Rob and thank you David thank you

387
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,199
you

388
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,839
you
