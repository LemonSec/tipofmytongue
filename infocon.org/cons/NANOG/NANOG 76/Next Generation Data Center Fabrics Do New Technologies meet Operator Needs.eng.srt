1
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:15,559
okay thanks so much and really enjoyed

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:18,920
Edwards inspirational talk and I'd like

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:22,160
to move on to some more technical topics

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,529
and my name is rod remarks and what

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,950
you're going to hear here now is a set

6
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:29,869
of three talks that are coordinated in

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,759
the form of a track and the track is

8
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:34,550
about next-generation data center

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:38,630
network fabrics the new technologies

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:42,550
meet operator needs and I'm gonna do the

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:47,570
introduction to this section so this is

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:50,390
up until till noon we'll have speakers

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:55,280
Oh mark Cardona and Paul Condon will

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:57,109
come after this on addressing hyper

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,719
scale high-performance computing with

16
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:02,629
our our DMA and talking about some new I

17
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,510
Triple E I Triple E 802 standardization

18
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:08,509
on congestion isolation and we're trying

19
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,140
to allow some time for discussion in

20
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:15,470
this segment because we're trying to

21
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,659
look at ways to activities and I Triple

22
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,539
E standardization activities and maybe

23
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:22,909
an IETF that may be of relevance to the

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,189
nanog community and where one of our

25
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:28,759
goals here is to try to reach out to the

26
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:29,929
user community and find out if or on the

27
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,759
right track and if there are some

28
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,890
problems that people are seeing in data

29
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,259
center operations that could be

30
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,689
addressed by new standardization or new

31
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:42,229
technologies and it's an effort that

32
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:46,339
that started with a talk I gave at the

33
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:48,380
previous nanog 75 on this topic so this

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,990
particular topic but I'm gonna do first

35
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,329
is advancing Ethernet for data center

36
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,270
networks and I have a lot to say about I

37
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,619
Triple E standard so I have a disclaimer

38
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,979
letting you know that I'm speaking and

39
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:03,649
my from my own views and I'm not giving

40
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:07,399
you an interpretation of I Triple E

41
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:10,940
standards as a formal formal

42
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:13,070
representative of I Triple E but I do

43
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,320
want to talk about the I Triple E 802

44
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:18,470
standardization land man Standards

45
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:22,260
Committee it's been around since March

46
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,629
of 1980 developing standards for

47
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:29,190
lands and Mane's and some other kind of

48
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:31,920
networks and I've been active on the

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,079
executive committee since 1998 so I have

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,879
I guess that's more than half of the

51
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,310
time that the Standards Committee has

52
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:45,569
been around in NATO - the focus is on

53
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:48,390
the lower two layers of the network and

54
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:52,220
the physical layer and the data link

55
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,220
which is essentially the maca layer and

56
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:59,930
you can find out more about that in a

57
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,930
standard called I Triple E standard 802

58
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:10,049
specific fairly new activity and I

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,609
Triple E 802 is called nandaka it's a

60
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,220
group that I'm the chair of and it's

61
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:16,230
about it's an end accussed ants for

62
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,720
network enhancements for the next decade

63
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:22,560
and it's not a standards developing

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,530
group but it's a activity to try to

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,480
build consensus and I would say mainly

66
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,780
look at requirements to try to

67
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,399
understand how we can make better

68
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,450
standards and make more relevant

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,700
standards and important aspect of nanika

70
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,040
is that it's an open activity and it's

71
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,290
open to anybody and we have meetings and

72
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,929
we have teleconferences and we circulate

73
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,660
documents and I encourage all of you if

74
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:54,389
you're interested to participate you're

75
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:58,500
welcome we we don't develop standards

76
00:03:54,389 --> 00:04:00,239
but we we may come up with documentation

77
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,730
explaining why we think there's a role

78
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,470
for new standards and one of the things

79
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,858
that you'll hear about today from caulk

80
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,230
ogden is is how some of that

81
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:12,419
documentation that we already developed

82
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:19,199
has spun off into a new standardization

83
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:21,539
project the the previous report that

84
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,310
this nenek activity published was called

85
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:26,699
the lossless Network for data centers

86
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:31,020
and it tried to look at what some of the

87
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:33,990
key factors were for lossless Ness and

88
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,080
data centers and the applications of

89
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,129
those kind of network

90
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,729
and how we can try to manage congestion

91
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:45,699
to achieve lossless network so that

92
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:47,710
document was published but it's subject

93
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:50,500
to ongoing comments so if you want to

94
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,109
comment on it feel free to do so we'll

95
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,849
consider those comments and we may we've

96
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,830
had discussions about reopening the

97
00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:03,729
activity to a revision of the report

98
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:06,639
with additional information let me just

99
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,889
skip over this there's a few slides that

100
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,050
are that I've referring to here that

101
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,599
came from the report that just talk

102
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,180
about the functionalities and that the

103
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,759
process that happens in data centers and

104
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:24,639
the intention here is of this slide is

105
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:27,430
to try to to talk about in caste problem

106
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,280
where some kind of aggregator forms out

107
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,620
a problem in the data center to many

108
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,659
different distributed workers but all

109
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,759
the responses have to come back to the

110
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:38,800
original source and they're very strict

111
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:44,529
latency requirements but there's also a

112
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:48,400
this in caste problem where lots of

113
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:51,159
packets are arriving or out addressed to

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:57,508
the same destination at the same time

115
00:05:51,159 --> 00:06:00,250
and that leads to congestion one of the

116
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:02,469
focal points that we have here and you

117
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,490
know Mar will be discussing this in much

118
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:10,990
more detail in the next talk is related

119
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:13,539
to the use of our DMA remote direct

120
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,400
memory access and the data center and so

121
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:21,039
what I've what I'm showing here in this

122
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:24,849
slide is a is a comparison to the data

123
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,919
flow you'd see with with our DMA as

124
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:31,628
compared to what you'd see with a kind

125
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:41,729
of a normal tcp/ip application so on the

126
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:43,690
Left you'll see traffic that flows the

127
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:46,229
traffic that flows down from an

128
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,820
application down into sockets and a

129
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:52,810
transport driver and on to a NIC

130
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,120
and data that flows across the network

131
00:06:52,810 --> 00:07:00,820
on Aniyah can back up through the the

132
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:06,700
stack at the receiving target and the

133
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:10,840
this this technology that that has spun

134
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,550
into modern RDMA I think a lot of it

135
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,090
began out of the infinity band

136
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,980
technologies and and what came out of

137
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,400
infinite affinity band was this

138
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:25,690
technology called rocky or RDMA over

139
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:28,870
converged Ethernet and the basic idea is

140
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:32,920
to be able to transfer data from from

141
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,510
memory to memory directly among two

142
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,970
servers and one of the things that

143
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:40,599
happens is that the the network driving

144
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,410
is all done through an advanced Rocky

145
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,790
supported Nick and that takes the

146
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,520
computational activity out of the server

147
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,890
and frees it up to do other other things

148
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,049
and makes for a much a quicker and more

149
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,510
efficient process and so I think that

150
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,280
originally a lot of that data traffic

151
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:01,260
was developed for high performance

152
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,400
computing and for fast origin and

153
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:07,840
originally on an entirely separate

154
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,700
Network operation the idea of Rocky was

155
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,890
to be able to support this thing over

156
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,729
converged Ethernet so to be able to put

157
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:17,469
it on a network interface that was also

158
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:21,870
used for other purposes within the

159
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:25,960
network and Ethernet was that was the

160
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:31,950
technology of choice and that's that's

161
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:34,419
how rocky that's how rocky developed and

162
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:40,150
you can sort of see in this picture that

163
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:43,090
the evolution from three three different

164
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,430
stacks here from this infinity band

165
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,470
transport protocol in the old days going

166
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:51,910
over an infinity band link layer and

167
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:54,010
then with rocky the that infinity band

168
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,150
link layer being replaced by Ethernet

169
00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:00,760
link layer and then more recently rocky

170
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:04,839
v2 which

171
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,450
gets rid of the IP I be in turf indie

172
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:12,520
band network Larry replaces it with UDP

173
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:15,310
over IP and so this is the the the

174
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,550
current implementation of rocky is this

175
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:22,989
v2 and the problem that we see here is

176
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:27,579
that the this infinity band transport

177
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:31,120
protocol is is dependent on the

178
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:36,339
transport layer beneath it and it's not

179
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,950
tolerant of packet loss and neither UDP

180
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,990
so UDP is not giving you any protection

181
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,310
against packet loss and historically

182
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,270
Ethernet didn't either

183
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:48,339
so in this kind of environment it became

184
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,140
pressing on the ethernet layer to take

185
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:54,940
more and more of the responsibility and

186
00:09:50,140 --> 00:10:07,029
be able to provide the lossless at that

187
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:11,770
level so the skip to the next one so

188
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:14,589
back in around 2006 I Triple E 802 began

189
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,850
a task group called the data center

190
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:18,820
bridging task group to develop

191
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:22,709
improvements to the 802 technologies to

192
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:26,050
be able to support these more advanced

193
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:27,699
requirements on Ethernet and the key

194
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,390
technologies that were developed and

195
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,930
standardized at that time were PFC or

196
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,910
priority based flow control and

197
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,099
congestion notification and enhanced

198
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,079
transmission selection and I'll just

199
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,260
quickly highlight these but you're going

200
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,910
to be getting more more detail about

201
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,350
these issues in the couple next couple

202
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:53,560
of talks but in a sort of schematic way

203
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,649
at datacenter Network you can see that

204
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,739
you can have an in Katz problem and even

205
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:02,500
if you try to use ecmp or some other way

206
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,300
to distribute your flows you're always

207
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,279
going to end up with congestion at the

208
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,439
at the output source because all the

209
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:11,310
packets that are addressed to that

210
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:22,040
source are going to result in in caste

211
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:23,910
and at a single node and the 802 dot one

212
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,370
standardization approach to try to

213
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:35,459
address this that's priority flow

214
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:39,300
control is is designed to pause flows

215
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:41,339
based on the the priority level and so

216
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,300
it's an it's a more advanced version of

217
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:50,610
the Ethernet pause statement which would

218
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:52,699
basically be a complete complete pause

219
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,309
of all traffic classes this thing can

220
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:59,719
pause for traffic class but what we

221
00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:04,670
found is that that's to krutov of a tool

222
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:07,740
because there can be flows that are not

223
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:10,229
contributing to the congestion and they

224
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,990
get paused in anyway because they happen

225
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,389
to be at the same traffic class and

226
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,029
that's one of the things that we've

227
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:23,120
tried to look at in our an octave 'ti

228
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:27,029
that's led to this new standardization

229
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,809
topic on congestion isolation that Paul

230
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:34,740
will tell you more about this figure is

231
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:36,420
a bit complex but it's trying to it's

232
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:40,889
trying to illustrate this problem of

233
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:44,279
head-of-line blocking where the pausing

234
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:46,110
a single traffic flow will lead to a lot

235
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,660
of congestion throughout the network and

236
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,430
one of the things that you you that

237
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,219
we're ready to hear from people that do

238
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,829
data center operations is that the PFC

239
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,319
is a adds a lot of complexity and it's

240
00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:01,290
kind of unpredictable and people feel

241
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:06,870
that it's it's not something they're

242
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:10,290
comfortable with and one of the approach

243
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,600
is that that we've we've taken in the

244
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,029
standardization activity is to introduce

245
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,899
this congestion isolation congested flow

246
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:20,740
isolation as a way to get a much more

247
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:24,540
refined version

248
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,790
a flow controller can isolate and and

249
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:30,339
[Music]

250
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:33,939
and control a single flow at a time and

251
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:38,250
let the other ones to continue these

252
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:41,649
slides I think you can you might want to

253
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:44,260
take a further look at these offline but

254
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:48,610
this is trying to illustrate on a

255
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:52,480
system-wide basis that the the ability

256
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:55,120
of the isolation process to let the

257
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:03,010
so-called victim flows continue without

258
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:06,399
without pause I have here a list of some

259
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:13,060
of the sources that that the figures

260
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:14,950
have been extracted from here and before

261
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:19,619
we we proceed to the next couple of

262
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:22,209
talks and and Omar and Paul's talk I

263
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,750
want to just refer back to this nimdok

264
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:27,579
activity because I do want to encourage

265
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:32,140
you to look at the report that we've

266
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:37,959
we've issued and look at how we update

267
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:41,529
to it and other kind of standardization

268
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:43,540
activities that may be useful and remind

269
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:45,670
you that we're open process we've got a

270
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,319
website that's open and you can read

271
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,529
about our our meetings in

272
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,029
teleconferences and we're trying to

273
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,829
think about how we can do further

274
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:56,350
outreach to the Nano community if we

275
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:58,449
find that there's some synergy we want

276
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,490
to see if we can think about what we

277
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:05,110
could do with future meetings and future

278
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:07,779
opportunities to to try to see if we can

279
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,529
address your needs and I would like to

280
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:13,890
wrap up my talk a little bit early and

281
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:18,450
turn the floor over to our next speaker

282
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:21,569
and moderate do you want to introduce

283
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,570
reduction err

284
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,329
you
