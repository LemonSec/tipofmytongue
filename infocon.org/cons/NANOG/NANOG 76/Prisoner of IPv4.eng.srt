1
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,540
my name is Lee Howard my company is

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,910
routed via we do ipv6 consulting

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,570
training translation the whole tradition

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,550
transition consulting 10 years ago I

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,230
came to nan again I talked about the

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,400
total cost of ownership of carry grade

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,290
net and I provided a spreadsheet

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,419
something like this that said you could

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,280
plug in some numbers and talk about how

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,750
many things broke when you did carry a

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,280
great net because the address sharing

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,690
was a little complicated and then you

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,550
could talk about your cost and I came up

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,780
with something like yeah and you know

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,370
the whole point was to let you do your

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,589
own math and I came up with something

17
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,150
like at around thirty five thirty

18
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:46,909
between thirty and forty dollars per

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,670
user oh it's only around thirty to forty

20
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:51,290
dollars per ipv4 address it's you're

21
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,019
better off buying addresses than doing

22
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,390
carrier grade net well it's a few years

23
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:58,100
later and the cost of addresses is

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,610
climbing I think it's time to revisit

25
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,890
this so I looked at the price of ipv4

26
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:07,640
addresses I've got data here from IP

27
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,350
trading and ipv4 auctions Hilco they're

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,580
you know they're here

29
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,270
and so I've got both of their data

30
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,350
plotted over time I used sort of Moton

31
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,270
the most recent data over the past

32
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,030
couple of years you can see of course

33
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,280
when you have a few transactions put

34
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,479
predictions trend lines go in in strange

35
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,549
directions but they're really

36
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:27,350
interesting cluster isn't there of data

37
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:29,090
you can see if we project it's just a

38
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,070
quadratic extrapolation that's what

39
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,299
looks like is the best fit we can see

40
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,298
that it looks like we're gonna hit about

41
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:38,329
$30 an address maybe as soon as the end

42
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:42,020
of this year or in or in a year next

43
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:44,689
year and it looks like maybe $40 in in

44
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,520
2020 sometime in 2020 that's not that

45
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,529
crazy that's you know this is not a very

46
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,450
steep curve I don't want to be in the

47
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,820
business of making price predictions

48
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,130
that's a great way to go broke I don't

49
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,928
want to be providing advice that anybody

50
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,640
wants to sue me over so do talk to a

51
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:59,990
broker if you're interested in what the

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,939
transactions are looking like and what

53
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,339
they think the predictions are but I'm

54
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,829
just taking the historical data and

55
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,740
extrapolating it forward so it's not

56
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:11,690
that far away from 40 or 50 dollars

57
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,310
we're talking three years that's your

58
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,530
normal strategic planning window right

59
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,940
alright so now we're the thirty to forty

60
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,640
dollars I was talking about we're

61
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,950
looking at not that far away from there

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,940
of course ipv6 right that's that's the

63
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,390
alternative so let's

64
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,310
look at the growth in ipv6 I've got four

65
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,529
different data sets here the blue line

66
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,330
is Eric Vinci among other things that he

67
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,610
looks at he looks at the top 50 web

68
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,080
sites in the US right now about half of

69
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,810
those have ipv6 that's good

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,960
and that trend line is is increasing and

71
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,220
we if the if the trend continues the way

72
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,510
it has been in the past we could say

73
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,670
that a hundred percent of websites of

74
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,450
you a hundred percent of the top 50 web

75
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,489
sites in the US would have ipv6 in

76
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,950
twenty twenty four five years all right

77
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,770
that's that's kind of cool the Green

78
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,810
Line is Dan wing he measures the top

79
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,940
twenty five thousand global websites and

80
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,310
so similar all of these have similar

81
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,410
kinds of trajectories but you know a

82
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,730
little bit less percentage of

83
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,430
penetration and there we'd say something

84
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,780
like twenty twenty six is when a hundred

85
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,010
percent of websites in the world or one

86
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,620
percent of the top twenty five thousand

87
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,780
will have ipv6 then the other two lines

88
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,400
the red and yellow ones are Google's

89
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,410
data and ap annex data measuring how

90
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,360
many users have ipv6 that's global and

91
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:27,500
again we can extrapolate that and say

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,120
yeah so sometime in 2026 maybe 2027 at

93
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,800
current trends if those continued if we

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,900
don't have an s-curve and a long tail

95
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,660
tapering off we might hit a hundred

96
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,700
percent ipv6 that's great news it's

97
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,470
about the same funny thing with the

98
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,670
price data and this data quadratic

99
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,160
curves that seems to be the best fit

100
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:46,940
with all of it but this is a little bit

101
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,579
longer than the slope of the ipv6 of the

102
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:53,570
of the ipv4 address curve so what

103
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:56,720
happens between 30 40 50 etc dollars per

104
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,700
address and this price well not good

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,590
things as far as I'm concerned there's a

106
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,299
problem when some people have to pay for

107
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,769
addresses in order to enter our market

108
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,720
and others already have them or others

109
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,550
are already holding on to address space

110
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,350
trying to keep somebody else trying to

111
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,320
keep competition from from being able to

112
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,090
compete so I've been thinking about this

113
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,279
and looking at it as a there seems to be

114
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,530
within that window of people who haven't

115
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,599
deployed which apparently is not most of

116
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,900
this room which is good news there seems

117
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,760
to be a hesitation that if I'm the last

118
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,890
mover then I'm the winner because I've

119
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,289
delayed making that expense or that

120
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:32,719
effort longer than anybody else but if

121
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,570
everybody says I want to wait until my

122
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,680
competitor deploys ipv6 and the

123
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,920
competitor is saying I want to wait

124
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,130
until

125
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,840
my competitor deploys ipv6 then we have

126
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,420
something that looks like kind of like a

127
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,739
game of chicken or maybe the prisoner's

128
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,190
dilemma where if I know what your

129
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,900
strategy is then my strategy changes so

130
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,010
I've been thinking about this as a

131
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,799
personal you know the prisoner's dilemma

132
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:57,050
cops arrest two people and say you're

133
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,050
going to jail for however many years if

134
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,550
you rat out the other guy then you'll

135
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,160
you'll go free and that guy will go to

136
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,750
jail but if they rat you out and you

137
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,160
don't say anything you'll go to jail and

138
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,580
even write each other out a different

139
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,120
number of years in prison so there's an

140
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,409
permutations of those different

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,570
variations have different amounts of

142
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,860
time in jail for each of those so I'm

143
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,330
looking at this one of the ways that you

144
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,760
solve this is you look at a payoff

145
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,219
matrix where you compare the strata the

146
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,610
potential strategies of the two players

147
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,350
so player a either rats out or doesn't

148
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,510
rat out player B rats out or doesn't

149
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,850
matter in this case player a across the

150
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,490
top I have content providers promoting

151
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,860
ipv6 or not promoting ipv6 and on the

152
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,380
side I've got carriers promoting ipv6 or

153
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,930
not promoting high 56 and it looks to me

154
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,400
like okay if carriers and content

155
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,320
providers all promote I could be six

156
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,000
then everybody wins and it looks to me

157
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,500
like you know then you can see the other

158
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,820
permutations if nobody does anything

159
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,340
that everybody is spending money to keep

160
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,630
ipv4 going eventually eventually and and

161
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,119
it doesn't happen at the same time for

162
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,010
everybody but what's really more

163
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,600
interesting to me at this point I said

164
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,670
okay well that's that's obvious anybody

165
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,800
can see that but what's interesting is

166
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,410
to say well how big an difference is

167
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,650
that strategy change if it costs me 10

168
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:12,020
cents to deploy ipv6 but I get no I only

169
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,849
get 5 cents worth of benefit out of it

170
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,830
maybe I don't even want to spend the

171
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,410
hour doing it right that's not a good

172
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,240
strategy so we would like to be able to

173
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,830
assign some numbers to these so we can

174
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,980
compare the values the various

175
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,080
strategies alright let's let's see if we

176
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,360
can do that let's look at the payoff

177
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,219
matrix let's start with carriers and I'm

178
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,270
talking about both fixed broadband ISPs

179
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:38,570
cable DSL 550d H whatever and mobile

180
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,310
carriers so we can start with what does

181
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,080
the cost of how do they make their money

182
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,000
they make their money there's some

183
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,520
combination that subscribers pay them

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,260
revenue and that revenue is divided the

185
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,849
average revenue per user per year our

186
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,780
Pugh is divided between whatever it

187
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,020
costs by the service

188
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,309
and the profit on the service some years

189
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,780
ago I looked at the operating income and

190
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,639
operating expenses for a bunch of ISPs

191
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,138
and I decided 30% was a decent average

192
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,950
so that's what I'm using here it doesn't

193
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,700
really matter you can do your own

194
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:07,370
numbers so if you have 30% profit you

195
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,349
know that okay if you for example if you

196
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,540
had a tier of service that's a hundred

197
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:17,180
and sixty-five dollars a year then your

198
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:18,910
profit at 30% is $49.50 now that's okay

199
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,290
so that's just the way that math works

200
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,330
but if in a couple of years we're

201
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,750
talking about you have to buy an ipv4

202
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,760
address at 50 dollars in order to turn

203
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,190
up that user then all of a sudden your

204
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,849
costs actually exceed your total your

205
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,590
revenue so at 50 dollars you're for the

206
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,919
first year of service for a customer is

207
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,599
negative 50 cents well that's I don't

208
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,590
want to surprise anybody here that's not

209
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,120
profitable so what do you do about that

210
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,679
well by the way some people are probably

211
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,900
saying a hundred and sixty-five dollars

212
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,880
a year we don't have tears that are just

213
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,500
on that's always charge per month that's

214
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,060
not it here we have well if you live in

215
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,760
one of these countries there is a

216
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,290
service that is a broadband tier for one

217
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,800
hundred sixty five dollars a year or

218
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:06,140
less so it is a real thing and if there

219
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,310
exists tears in not and not all these

220
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,390
are developing economies with low

221
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:14,120
broadband by the way okay so your

222
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,219
options are if you want to be profitable

223
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,640
as addresses address prices are climbing

224
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,590
your options are raise prices

225
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,360
mmm one hundred and sixty five dollars a

226
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,330
year you're gonna raise prices by fifty

227
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,800
bucks that's really a huge increase on

228
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,130
that tier that's probably not gonna go

229
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,400
over well

230
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,500
now you could require extended contracts

231
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,270
say okay the first year isn't profitable

232
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,099
but we're gonna make the profit over two

233
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,360
or three or five years which may or may

234
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,360
not work in your particular market if

235
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,560
you're at a highly dynamic the ephemeral

236
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,710
market where people move around a lot

237
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,170
that may not work so well address

238
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,400
sharing of course carrier-grade NAT

239
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,610
depends on you know what might break

240
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,620
that those be with that service you can

241
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,570
deploy ipv6 of course of course I'm

242
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,150
gonna say you can deploy ipv6 that is

243
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,520
really only a unique option a standalone

244
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,160
option if I BB six is a replacement for

245
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,529
ipv4 you can't just deploy ipv6 and say

246
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,029
okay

247
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:08,249
I'm done if you still want to provide

248
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:11,100
ipv4 connectivity if you still need to

249
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:13,230
provide ipv4 connectivity you can say

250
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,220
you know what this is too hard I'm not

251
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,230
gonna make any money

252
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,810
turn down the customers sell off the

253
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,970
addresses I'm moving to Hawaii or

254
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,309
probably most likely is some combination

255
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,110
of those above options and I think the

256
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:26,819
most likely one is to say it's probably

257
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,480
some combination of address sharing and

258
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:33,449
ipv6 and here's why in the US this is

259
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,870
Facebook's chart in the u.s. ipv6 is

260
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:39,748
about 55 maybe it's nearly 60 percent of

261
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,059
hits on Facebook come over ipv6 so all

262
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:45,240
right you can take maybe the lower users

263
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,709
are less likely to use less likely have

264
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,269
problems with carrier grade nat they're

265
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,758
less likely to do BitTorrent they're

266
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,079
less likely to do high-intensity

267
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:55,110
head-to-head gaming those kinds of

268
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:57,660
things where we're cgn potentially

269
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,600
raises problems and for my understanding

270
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,189
cgn is not as bad as it used to be so

271
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,990
maybe you could say I'm going to deploy

272
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:06,509
ipv6 and put some customers behind

273
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,949
carrier-grade NAT and then your problems

274
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:09,449
are solved in fact if you do one hundred

275
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:11,839
to one address sharing you can sell off

276
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:16,019
99 addresses and make a profit they're

277
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:18,629
probably maybe not well what does it

278
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,430
cost let's talk about the cost of carry

279
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:23,370
great net and see how this how this

280
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,870
plays out so again this is not this the

281
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,430
same number but carry a great net you've

282
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,829
got to buy some hardware and you've got

283
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,079
to buy some addresses it looks to me

284
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:33,569
doing a survey of retail prices of nat

285
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,699
vendors that hardware is reasonable to

286
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:37,378
estimate at $1,000 per gigabit per

287
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:38,279
second go talk to your vendors they're

288
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:40,920
gonna give you a completely different

289
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,529
number depending on your relationship

290
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,149
with that vendor and this might be in

291
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:46,800
fact four of redundant pair because you

292
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:49,620
probably don't want to deploy these

293
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,410
alone so thousand dollars print for a

294
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,379
gigabit per second of capacity and then

295
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,819
some ipv4 addresses for the outside all

296
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,100
right how many ipv4 addresses do we need

297
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:01,439
to buy well there's a recent thread on

298
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,480
Nana very helpful Thank You Nemec that

299
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:06,389
somewhere between 200 and thousand users

300
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,009
can fit on one gigabit per second I'm

301
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:09,839
gonna go a little towards the low end

302
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:11,550
I'm going to call it 400 and that's

303
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,290
because you're capacity doesn't it's not

304
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,149
your full capacity for all customers and

305
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,490
because we're talking to you know two or

306
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:19,259
three years in the future so 400 custom

307
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,910
but I still don't know how many

308
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:22,619
addresses I need I just need I need know

309
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,879
I need enough addresses for 400

310
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:28,889
customers so then I go to who can tell

311
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:32,040
me how do I figure out what a reasonable

312
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:33,869
address sharing ratio is you know the

313
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,279
mobile guys are pretty much all doing

314
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:37,949
address sharing right they all have net

315
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,660
now so let's go look at them so I looked

316
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:41,069
at the number of ipv4 addresses that

317
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,649
mobile carriers are announcing this is

318
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:46,618
per kada mostly I think is where I found

319
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:48,029
this data and then I looked up their

320
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:49,679
their public announcements about how

321
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:52,199
many subscribers they have and then I

322
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,519
just did division this is not going to

323
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,929
be exact right but it's going to be

324
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,910
close enough to if we're just trying to

325
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,800
get pic a realistic number to get some

326
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:02,730
idea and there's this great range of

327
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,139
just under one address per user 226

328
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,939
addresses fuser pretty wide range I'm

329
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,420
delighted to find that there at least in

330
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:10,980
the same order of magnitude so and it

331
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,589
turns out that get an average of about

332
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,869
10 addresses me 10 users per address

333
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,149
that's what mobile carriers by and large

334
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:20,720
are on average doing now so let's use

335
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:23,970
that for our model 10 users per address

336
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,399
at $50 an address so if I've got 400

337
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:30,240
users 10 users per address I need 40

338
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,759
addresses at $50 40s this times 50 bucks

339
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,459
each that's $2,000 so my cost for

340
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:38,939
carrier grade nat is $1,000 per gigabit

341
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:40,618
plus $2,000 for gigabit that's $3,000

342
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:42,480
you know I should have included and I

343
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:44,129
didn't talk about it before you're also

344
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,670
gonna have to update your provisioning

345
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:49,439
systems and your OSS and your monitoring

346
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:52,170
all those tools and I call that I

347
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:53,819
ballpark that at $2 per user it looks to

348
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,819
me when I talk to ISPs who are doing

349
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:57,990
these things that the very large ISPs do

350
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,490
have more systems that have to be

351
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,230
updated it's more complicated smaller

352
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,179
eyes Peas maybe have systems that are

353
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,429
off the shelf and require fewer custom

354
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:07,259
updates so it ballparks at $2 per user

355
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:09,959
and then I'm used that same number for

356
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,779
power cooling monitoring staffing space

357
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,729
all the you know the annual operating

358
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,709
costs there you go

359
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,240
cost per cgn this doesn't include any

360
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:20,699
breakage the stuff that I was really on

361
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,199
about a while back that's not included

362
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,639
here so you probably want to throw in a

363
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:25,649
little bit of discount for the number of

364
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,809
tech support calls you guess people

365
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:31,200
complaining about not having native v4

366
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:35,250
or whatever so now I can say

367
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,820
the cost of cgn is for 400 users 3800

368
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,840
which works out to $9.50 per user

369
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,980
alright that's you know okay that's

370
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,100
probably a little more than I expected

371
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,090
but that's not too crazy and this gives

372
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,030
me enough that I can now go back and

373
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:51,170
populate that payoff matrix so if

374
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,280
content if carriers deploy ipv6 and

375
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,390
content from one side be b6 so carriers

376
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,280
don't need to do all this address

377
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,939
sharing then carriers win they get to

378
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:03,510
avoid that $9.50 and two bucks a year or

379
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,790
whatever the annual op X is if carriers

380
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,100
promote ipv6 hoping that they don't have

381
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,199
to do cgn but content providers don't do

382
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,420
ipv6 then they do have to spend this

383
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,100
money well that's how carriers lose is

384
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,650
they spend the money to deploy ipv6 and

385
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,660
it doesn't pay off for them now this is

386
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:21,300
definitely proportionate right if 50

387
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,770
percent of websites have ipv6 then your

388
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,260
cost is less because you have to do this

389
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,600
for fewer users or less traffic so that

390
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,970
definitely helps and of course of

391
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,710
carriers do nothing they have to do one

392
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,510
of the other strategies maybe I'm saying

393
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:37,320
they buy addresses maybe they give up

394
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,840
and they move to Hawaii alright good now

395
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,850
let's talk about the payoff matrix for

396
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,500
content providers well so content

397
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,390
providers have definitely noticed that

398
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,220
ipv4 has run out they've gone and bought

399
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,710
addresses out of 134 million addresses

400
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,270
transferred in the address market you

401
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,190
can see that the content providers are

402
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,260
buying the bulk of them Amazon and

403
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,870
amazon.com are about 40% of the total

404
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,819
transfers thank you to Brendon Curtis

405
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,250
and Mueller for this data really

406
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,800
fascinating there are a couple of ISPs

407
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,840
on here charter and frontier have both

408
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,699
bought some addresses but really we're

409
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,620
looking at the cloud providers the

410
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,970
content providers that's the people who

411
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,920
are growing so fast they're worried

412
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:18,990
about still having addresses okay so

413
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,670
what does matter to content providers it

414
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,630
turns out that speed actually

415
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:26,729
significantly impacts content providers

416
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,590
profitability that's and I found this I

417
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,540
looked over and over 20 figure out what

418
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,130
would matter them and I found quote from

419
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,469
Amazon that every hundred milliseconds

420
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,270
of latency cost them 1% in sales

421
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,430
I'm quoting them I didn't make that up

422
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,890
Akamai said 100 millisecond delay in

423
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:43,560
page load time can hurt conversion rates

424
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,939
by 7% Google didn't experiment where

425
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,920
they added

426
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,650
more results to the front page of search

427
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,349
results and found that a half a sec that

428
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:54,270
more results actually delayed the page

429
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,150
return by half a second which caused a

430
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,610
20% drop rate now for an ad site like

431
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,829
Google there's they're supported by ads

432
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,050
right that's how they make their revenue

433
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:06,480
20% drop rate means they don't get to

434
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,310
serve those ads they don't show you the

435
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,690
ads you don't click on the ads they

436
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,869
don't make the money so that's

437
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,950
correlated directly to revenue why are

438
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,480
you bringing up speed late we're talking

439
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,790
about ipv6 what does that have to do

440
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,840
with or the overall market what is that

441
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,670
what does one thing have to do with the

442
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,540
other well it's fascinating that there

443
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:26,880
is over the years this pretty

444
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,790
overwhelming body of data that shows

445
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,130
that ipv6 is actually faster than ipv4

446
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:35,640
and it's significantly faster this is

447
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:38,100
LinkedIn looked at 18 T's Sprint

448
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,850
t-mobile and Verizon and this is the

449
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:46,020
percentage improvement of v6 over v4 15%

450
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:48,420
25% 17 18 % and 2 or 3 percent but

451
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,920
that's that's all of the mobile carriers

452
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,110
in the u.s. right and it's the same

453
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,620
thing for other countries too and we

454
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:58,050
find this over and over and over so ins

455
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,190
there's a summary slide here but I want

456
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,329
to stop on this one and point out I

457
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,420
don't know why I have Africa listed

458
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:05,400
twice that ipv6 is faster pretty much

459
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,339
everywhere you go to the only place

460
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,870
that's not is China you can make up your

461
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,020
own reasons for why it isn't faster in

462
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:14,040
China and I looked at this yesterday or

463
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,319
actually looked at it this morning and

464
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,420
it's more like right now Europe I think

465
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,300
is 20 milliseconds Americas in Africa

466
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,270
I'm more like 30 milliseconds v6 is 20

467
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,040
to 30 milliseconds faster than v4 that's

468
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,439
kind of incredible and I really want to

469
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,909
make the point that the the number of

470
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,220
people who have looked at the speed

471
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,260
comparison and have done you know

472
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,020
head-to-head comparison or or research

473
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,000
has been not just multiple different

474
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,160
organizations and people it's multiple

475
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,150
different methods of doing so and it's

476
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,500
been consistent over the last six years

477
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,060
that's that that seems to me it's pretty

478
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,160
incredible and I think that's enough

479
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,590
that I can say that v6 actually is

480
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,760
faster than v4 I don't know why I have

481
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,740
some theories maybe I'll submit a

482
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,120
lightning talk but I can say there's

483
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,250
enough measurement all the data that we

484
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,290
have says that this is a case

485
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,090
so I'm going to assume that the you know

486
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,030
that the data is true that he are true

487
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:08,669
and that this is the case okay so okay

488
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,920
had to point out some people might ask

489
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,970
well gee okay so it's twenty

490
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,160
milliseconds or ten emails like is

491
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,510
faster but those quotes that you had

492
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,510
we're talking about 100 milliseconds

493
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,260
does is 20 milliseconds proportionately

494
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,610
as much benefit as 100 milliseconds

495
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,760
fortunately LinkedIn tells us that yes

496
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,129
every half-second page load time

497
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:33,330
increment results in a very linear

498
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:35,160
decrease in the pageviews you know that

499
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,419
red line is it's not a perfect line but

500
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,550
it's pretty darn linear until you get up

501
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,550
to about five and a half seconds so that

502
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,649
says to me that yes the every increment

503
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,110
is worth as much as any other increment

504
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,480
so 20 seconds 20 milliseconds is worth

505
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,840
about one-fifth of 100 milliseconds it's

506
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,550
a linear improvement let's go back to

507
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,399
the line plumie time that's right when

508
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:58,139
we talk about what happens there because

509
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,370
there's a correlation obviously between

510
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:04,470
latency and web speed so if not

511
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,239
everybody here is a network engineer so

512
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,560
I just want to point out that we talked

513
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,960
about you know the internet being a

514
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,419
series of tubes or pipes if bandwidth is

515
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,310
how wide the pipe is then latency is how

516
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,840
long it is and so it doesn't matter if

517
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,940
you've got a certain amount of data it's

518
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,620
gonna take a certain amount of time for

519
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,120
that data to get to you no matter how

520
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,219
big the pipe is just because you have to

521
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,100
traverse that length now in the modern

522
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,080
web most browsers open six simultaneous

523
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,209
connections when they're downloading web

524
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,490
sites they don't do more because people

525
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,990
have found in their studies that more

526
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,810
than that actually begins to tax the

527
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:39,570
browser or the CPU of the client I'm

528
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:41,669
gonna skip over quick HTTP pipelining

529
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:45,360
because but I only have a few times a

530
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:48,000
few minutes so a typical web site might

531
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,530
have 50 or 100 or 150 different things

532
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,440
that you have to download in order to

533
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,420
display the whole page so browser opens

534
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,670
up six connections downloads them at

535
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,590
whatever speed as each one completes it

536
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,140
opens up the next connection and and so

537
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,699
on and so on and what the end of course

538
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,040
that's including that's there's still

539
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,700
the TCP handshake time and all that set

540
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,620
up to now what happens is if you are

541
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,570
able to decrease that time by 20

542
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,809
milliseconds then it's like moving the

543
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,059
web

544
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:17,100
server 20 milliseconds closer to the

545
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,690
client which improves the speed and it's

546
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,139
not just a 20 millisecond improvement

547
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,210
because that first connection finishes

548
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:25,620
20 milliseconds sooner and starts the

549
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,090
next one starts 20 milliseconds sooner

550
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,340
that's 7th connection then starts 20

551
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,779
milliseconds sooner and it finishes in

552
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,850
80 milliseconds and the one after that

553
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,440
so becomes a humilate of benefit the

554
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,990
more web objects you have the download

555
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,200
on your website there is math for this

556
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,279
so page load time is approximately the

557
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,039
number of objects you have to download

558
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,639
divided by how many simultaneous

559
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:51,899
connections you have times the latency

560
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:54,479
so for example if you have 150 things to

561
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:57,629
get in your website and you get six

562
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,340
simultaneous connections 20 milliseconds

563
00:20:57,629 --> 00:21:01,320
is worth do the math it's worth 500

564
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,019
milliseconds 20 milliseconds equals a

565
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,668
half a second in page load time that's

566
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:06,960
important because some of the quotes

567
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:08,669
that I have are talking about page load

568
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,440
time and some are talking about latency

569
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:11,940
so I just want to show that there's a

570
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,570
correlation there these these are

571
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,399
directly correlated to each other so now

572
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,769
let's look back at these quotes so if

573
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:22,590
Amazon says that 100 milliseconds of

574
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:24,600
latency costs 1% in sales and optimized

575
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,629
has a hundred milliseconds is 7% and

576
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,549
Google says a half a second is 20% well

577
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:31,949
then we can say according to the math

578
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:36,330
right then 20 milliseconds equals an

579
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:39,149
increase of 0.2% in sales for Amazon I'm

580
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,039
using their quotes and Matt I didn't

581
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:43,649
make this up I'm just using what exists

582
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:46,169
on the web what what they've said occupy

583
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:49,080
said 20 milliseconds is is well it said

584
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:52,350
100 milliseconds is is seven second is

585
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,600
7% therefore divided by five you get one

586
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,519
point four and Google said a half a

587
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,019
second page load time is worth 20% I can

588
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:00,529
do the math I have second is worth 20%

589
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:02,639
they said that Wow

590
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,350
you know and it's not just these guys

591
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:06,689
other people have said similar things

592
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,639
BBC Pinterest cookie lots of people have

593
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,730
said that this is true this is sort of

594
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:13,379
generally accepted in in the web

595
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,570
commerce world that performance equals

596
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:17,279
money I really like this and is true

597
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,539
over time I really like this this bottom

598
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,190
one though moba pie I don't know who

599
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,559
they are but they said that a hundred

600
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,389
milliseconds of page load time by

601
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,460
increasing their speed by just 100

602
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:27,590
milliseconds

603
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,960
that they were able to see an additional

604
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,480
one point 11 percent in conversions and

605
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,850
then they did the math and said that one

606
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,070
point 11 percent was worth $380,000 to

607
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,800
us that's 100 milliseconds a page load

608
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:43,310
time by the way not latency so that made

609
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:46,100
me go oh you know if you can do the math

610
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,260
and say that percent increase is worth

611
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,760
that many dollars then I can do the same

612
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,100
thing for these companies because they

613
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,020
they make the revenue numbers public so

614
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,510
20 milliseconds would increase Amazon

615
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,430
sales by 0.2 percent which is worth four

616
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,930
hundred million dollars that's what they

617
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:02,500
said their sales are that's what how

618
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:08,060
much they said speed it matters to them

619
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:09,710
Akamai 38 million Google a half a second

620
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:14,840
increase is worth over a billion dollars

621
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:16,820
to Google I'll come back to that too now

622
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,740
we can populate this payoff matrix and

623
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,110
we can say with actual numbers right we

624
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,850
can say that if content promotes ipv6

625
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,020
and carriers promote equity six Amazon

626
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,129
makes an additional four hundred million

627
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,889
dollars a year Google makes an

628
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:30,140
additional billion dollars a year if

629
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,660
content providers don't promote ipv6

630
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,550
then okay maybe they're not losing money

631
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,760
but they're missing out on that digital

632
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:40,129
revenue right and then you know Amazon

633
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,450
maybe they're finished buying eventually

634
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,860
they're gonna need more addresses who

635
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,690
knows what it looks like in five or ten

636
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,129
years so maybe Amazon and Google keep

637
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,040
buying addresses or maybe they don't

638
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,440
that's but there's potential increased

639
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,530
costs to them and definitely missed

640
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,840
revenue remember the whole point of this

641
00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:00,379
though was talking about it as as if it

642
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,760
were a prisoner's dilemma which I'm told

643
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,320
by an economist it technically isn't

644
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,879
because the best payoff isn't

645
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,370
necessarily ratting each other out but I

646
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,130
wanted to to use this as a controlling

647
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,500
metaphor so the point is if you know

648
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,060
what the other guy's interests are then

649
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,490
you know you can develop your own

650
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,860
strategy based on their strategy so

651
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:21,110
let's talk about strategy if I'm an

652
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,120
executive at Amazon and I understand

653
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:26,300
that ipv6 is worth four hundred million

654
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,100
dollars to me then why am i selling any

655
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,530
device that doesn't support ipv6

656
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,659
I'm costing myself money by selling

657
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:34,760
these things if I'm an executive at

658
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,980
Amazon I'm calling up my team right now

659
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,690
and I'm saying we need to tell all of

660
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,320
our vendors that we will not carry any

661
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,290
home gateway

662
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,770
that don't support ipv6 effective June 6

663
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,879
2020 because I want to see the

664
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,620
additional revenue that I get from that

665
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,090
I would start with home gateway

666
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,560
manufacturers but I'd include all

667
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,540
consumer electronics because it all

668
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,720
matters we still need ipv4 as long as

669
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,760
all this stuff doesn't have ipv6 and

670
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,040
it's probably a no-brainer but I'd also

671
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:05,660
be telling the team to enable ipv6 on

672
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:09,139
amazon.com good yeah that's not the rest

673
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:11,990
of us don't think that's the problem

674
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,910
that's a problematic statement would

675
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,760
this actually matter I wanted to show

676
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,890
yeah I think it would Amazon is about 5%

677
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,400
of the US retail market and I showed

678
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:25,010
earlier half of the US has ipv6 which

679
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,860
means if Amazon only sold be six capable

680
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:30,770
home gateways then five percent of the

681
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,260
home gateways in the US would be ipv6

682
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,370
capable if and then between those

683
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,570
probably half would go to homes that

684
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,149
already had v6 and half would go to

685
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,280
homes that don't have ipv6 ok so just by

686
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,140
selling the only v6 capable home

687
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,360
gateways we'd increase the deployment of

688
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,880
ipv6 inside the US by two and a half

689
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,830
percent per year that's cumulative does

690
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,720
that matter as a matter of fact North

691
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:55,040
American sales 141 billion dollars last

692
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,080
year increasing that by 0.2% that by two

693
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,510
and a half percent of users times that

694
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,580
point two percent in sales yes just that

695
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,410
one thing just in the US were just North

696
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,419
America would make seventy million

697
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:08,720
dollars for the difference compounding

698
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:11,330
annually if I'm an executive I'm looking

699
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,310
at that and that's my risk tolerance I'm

700
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,949
willing to take a couple of risks if it

701
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:17,629
means I can reach 70 million dollars how

702
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,700
much risk well that's that's you know

703
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,670
you're under turtle meth

704
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:25,190
by the way dual stacking amazon.com if

705
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:28,390
the world has 28% 2008 8% of the world

706
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:31,790
has ipv6 almost 29% at this morning

707
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:33,200
28% the world has ipv6 Amazon dual

708
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,879
stacks their site and gets a point two

709
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,900
percent increase in revenue that means

710
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,070
that their global sales increased by 116

711
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,230
million dollars the first year

712
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:45,500
that's not selling home gateways that's

713
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,910
just dual stacking amazon.com based on

714
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,660
their statements about the benefit of

715
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:52,820
speed ipv6 is faster Amazon makes 0.2

716
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,799
percent more money when they when there

717
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,350
sites faster therefore they make 160

718
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,450
million dollars by dual stacking

719
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,428
amazon.com I don't understand why

720
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,809
anybody wouldn't do that

721
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:04,159
Google similar kinds of things now

722
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:05,928
Google has already been very supportive

723
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,730
ipv6 great job on almost everything

724
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:09,620
they're already doing if I were an

725
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,000
executive at Google saying I'm missing

726
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,008
out on a potential billion dollars a

727
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,960
year in revenue I'm saying well maybe

728
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:17,690
I'd like to influence some other people

729
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,080
to deploy ipv6 also what can I do to do

730
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:23,480
that one of the things I could do is say

731
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,939
we know that search ranking search

732
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,370
results are one of the factors in search

733
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,889
results is page load time that Google

734
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:33,439
actually uses real user data to look at

735
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:35,418
page load time and pages that are that

736
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,250
would appear in similar results and

737
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:39,769
similar searches one of the factors is

738
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,809
how fast they load Google also knows

739
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:42,799
that v6 is faster the v4 they've got

740
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:44,539
their own measurements I haven't talked

741
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:49,639
to anybody Google I assume that they see

742
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:51,889
the same thing as everybody else if if

743
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:54,799
ipv6 is faster and page look PageRank

744
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:57,110
search page rank is higher based on

745
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,779
faster pages page load then put out a

746
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,070
blog post saying so I think every

747
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,929
marketing department of the world is

748
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,149
calling their website their webmaster

749
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:06,950
right now saying wait we can improve our

750
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,658
search rankings just by dual stacking I

751
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,940
don't know what dual stacking is but do

752
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:13,070
it let's get the marketing people

753
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,039
involved and we haven't even talked

754
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,840
about the additional revenues I another

755
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:19,970
sort of non-controversial statement is

756
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,220
show be nice to see ipv6 in every Google

757
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,559
cloud platform right everything they do

758
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,440
there right now it's that's just barely

759
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,178
a little bit about to be six port

760
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,590
similar to Amazon they can promote ipv6

761
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:34,370
certified devices and their search

762
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:37,668
results and why does Android not require

763
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:39,049
v6 on everything not just the apps but

764
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:41,000
the end of the other they're connecting

765
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,529
to it's time to really push this stuff

766
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,409
if you want to see these kinds of

767
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:47,690
additional revenue numbers Alibaba

768
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:50,840
you're in kind of the same industry

769
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:52,429
right I don't want to pretend that this

770
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,439
is just Amazon and Google I looked at

771
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:56,000
some other ecommerce sites and I looked

772
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,190
at their online sales for last year my

773
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,450
multiplied at times assuming a 1%

774
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,539
because I was sort of the the mix of

775
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:05,690
e-commerce results multiplied by 1%

776
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:06,650
assuming that their sales are evenly

777
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,440
divided around the world

778
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:13,160
and said okay 28% of the world has ipv6

779
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,950
so by dual stacking your site you would

780
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,540
get an additional 1% of that 28% in

781
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,430
sales

782
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,570
walmart.com tool stacks they get 47

783
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,720
million dollars in additional revenue

784
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,889
now that's assuming that their sales are

785
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,700
evenly distributed around the world

786
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:32,180
since in the u.s. ipv6 is available to

787
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,640
half or 55 56 percent of users it's more

788
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,890
like double that and all the other sites

789
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,040
may see staples Home Depot Best Buy Del

790
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,179
E Bay Best Buy and Dell really not tool

791
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,220
stacked come on guys

792
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:46,670
you want to make more money you need to

793
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,070
toe stack your sites now sites that make

794
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,870
revenue based on serving ads they're

795
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,570
models a little bit different and again

796
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,489
based on the previous quotes I'm gonna

797
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,710
go with 7% increase in sales because

798
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,030
that's you have to serve the ads people

799
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,059
have to view the ads in order for your

800
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:04,850
the ad the advertisers to pay the

801
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:07,730
websites so Twitter three billion dollar

802
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:09,649
and in revenue last year they make 60

803
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,540
million dollars if they dual stacked I

804
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:13,370
would really like to see dual stack on

805
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,170
Twitter I'd also like to see it on

806
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,030
reddit it's a site that I use a lot also

807
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,590
and two million dollars

808
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,970
okay Rena is known for having a very

809
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,830
small engineering team being very

810
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,890
efficient dual stacking they're hosted

811
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:27,350
by one of the CDNs that also supports

812
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,970
ipv6 so there shouldn't be that far for

813
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,860
them to go to dual stack and then of

814
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,990
course all these other sites again these

815
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,790
numbers will be double roughly double if

816
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:38,929
they're predominantly if their sales are

817
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:40,520
predominantly in the US now many people

818
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:42,590
in this room don't work for any of these

819
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,450
companies so I wanted to give you a tool

820
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,678
to do your own math so you can go to

821
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,050
this site you can go to tools that were

822
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,220
Tempe or net and you can see the week

823
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:51,139
that it doesn't look quite the same as

824
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,660
this but I've got a JavaScript page that

825
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,520
you can plug in how much you think the

826
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,550
20 percent or 30 milliseconds whatever

827
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,840
it is benefit would benefit you in sales

828
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,190
what your total online sales are and the

829
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,830
distribution I hope to come back later

830
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:06,080
and add your own balance of numbers how

831
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,580
much v6 is deployed in each of those

832
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,320
regions but I wanted to be able to

833
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,300
reflect that and so if you've got a ten

834
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,309
million dollar site and in 20

835
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,928
milliseconds is worth 1% in sales you

836
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:17,240
make forty six thousand forty six

837
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:19,040
thousand dollars is not bad for going on

838
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,330
the Akamai portal and checking the ipv6

839
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,980
check box

840
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:27,240
let's I don't want to leave carriers out

841
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:31,059
in terms of what it what matters to them

842
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:34,740
carriers you can fund so if we need

843
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:37,690
Amazon to sell just v6 on v6 capable

844
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,639
electronics operators you could do the

845
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,139
testing for them put a little skin in

846
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:44,049
there you could say you know what to

847
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:46,809
avoid $9.50 per new user we could spend

848
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:48,340
as 50 cents or a dollar in order to test

849
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:50,918
the home gateways and other consumer

850
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,840
electronics all right I don't care which

851
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:54,909
certification test we do we can pick any

852
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,490
of them I'd like to include map team at

853
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:59,679
beam 4 6 4 X let because if you're gonna

854
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:02,470
do cgn you might as well do one of this

855
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,509
six type IP v6 IP before translation

856
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:08,379
mechanisms so that you can do all v6

857
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:11,049
locally and and that yeah and then we

858
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:12,459
can help Amazon or we the carriers can

859
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:16,418
help Amazon and the other e-commerce

860
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:18,519
sites promote ipv6 the other thing that

861
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:20,940
we really ought to be seeing from ISPs

862
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,169
is dual stacking our business customers

863
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,820
they're you know a lot of those business

864
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:26,889
customers are very small companies that

865
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,408
look just like residential users just

866
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:31,539
respond to DHCP just just activate ipv6

867
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:35,110
for them for you static customers a

868
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:36,669
sauna massage 48 no static route for

869
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,158
your b2b customers a sign a massage 48

870
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:40,840
and configure BGP on your side

871
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,820
get the session open it's just just

872
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,830
hellos it's not a big deal and of course

873
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,509
obviously send email to the customers

874
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,158
saying you've done that communicate with

875
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:49,570
your customers now what I've talked

876
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,639
about this in the past a lot of people

877
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,990
have said oh geez that's gonna drive

878
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:55,869
customer calls that's gonna be so

879
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,639
expensive well if you're gonna go ipv6

880
00:32:55,869 --> 00:33:00,490
anyway you're gonna get those calls

881
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:02,590
anyway wouldn't you rather do it in a

882
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,600
controlled project where you can control

883
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,309
how fast that's rolled out and when

884
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,230
you're gonna get those calls you can

885
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:10,090
train your tech support people to know

886
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,769
how to respond to those calls and it's

887
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,749
not they're not diluted over three or

888
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:17,889
five years so they forget what they're

889
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:19,029
how they're supposed to respond right so

890
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:20,469
I didn't want it again didn't want to

891
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:21,940
leave out the carrier's provided a

892
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,740
spreadsheet for you guys also same

893
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,470
website tools don't write mu net carrier

894
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,419
- not plug in your subscriber counts

895
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,460
your average growth rate per year how

896
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:32,410
many users you add and then your current

897
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,180
ipv6 deployment deployment

898
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,690
so if you already have 60% of your users

899
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,100
have v6 that's what goes there

900
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,360
how much avoiding carry right now is

901
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,649
worth to you that's go talk to your

902
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,810
vendors figure out your own compression

903
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,330
ratio what your address prices are both

904
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:49,360
in capex and optics and then how much

905
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:50,830
you think it would help for Amazon and

906
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,810
Google to whoever else to support ipv6

907
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,429
that's that bottom that that middle 5%

908
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,409
and then they'll tell you over the years

909
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:58,480
how much difference that makes to you

910
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,840
it's really interesting isn't it if

911
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,850
we're talking about just a 5% difference

912
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,909
by contest chipping in and promoting

913
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,980
ipv6 for a million dollar a million user

914
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,270
subscriber that's two hundred thirty

915
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:14,350
four thousand dollars just in the first

916
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:16,600
year of saved cost of a voided cgn and

917
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:18,100
it's really amazing how fast that

918
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,500
accumulates because you're also avoiding

919
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,850
your annual optics that that $2 a year

920
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,190
and operating expense you're avoiding

921
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:26,560
that too so that's pretty you know

922
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:28,540
that's that's pretty fantastic mobile

923
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,840
carriers been really nice you can help

924
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:34,300
help us test find out what what apps

925
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,669
don't support ipv6 report those let's

926
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,380
get support for those and I've heard

927
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:41,379
that there are still some handset makers

928
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,490
who sell handsets that aren't v6 capable

929
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,560
and I've heard this especially

930
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:48,159
developing economies now maybe you're

931
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,679
not buying ipv6 in capable handsets but

932
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,418
if your vendor sells incapable handsets

933
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:54,400
to somebody else give them a hard time

934
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:55,960
lean on them because those developing

935
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,730
economies are really struggling now

936
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,490
because they can't get addresses and

937
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,750
they can't get v6 so help us out help

938
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,430
out the rest of the world so that you

939
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,130
can see this additional benefit in

940
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:09,399
avoiding cgn and I don't understand why

941
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:12,780
a Greenfield network like 5g would even

942
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,010
have ipv4 on it but it's not my field

943
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,050
all right so you kind of see what I've

944
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:19,180
gone with this what I'm trying to do is

945
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm trying to set this up so that is PS

946
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,020
and mobile carriers can do some

947
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,180
equipment testing which will help the

948
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,330
ecommerce sites and it will help the

949
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:30,940
e-commerce sites only so ipv6 capable

950
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:34,299
gear which helps the ISPs the mobile

951
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,500
carriers turn up ipv6 users which helps

952
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,810
the e-commerce sites make more money

953
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,130
it's this incredible virtuous cycle we

954
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,660
have a peer at the top and it's not just

955
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,160
the e-commerce sites but it's also the

956
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,509
ad revenue sites that are making more

957
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,310
money that there's additional users also

958
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,630
helped turn up these six in the cloud

959
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,140
right that that motivates the cloud

960
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:54,180
providers to also support ipv6 on all of

961
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,379
their products and with their help than

962
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,390
the e-commerce sites and all the other

963
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,369
websites it's easier for them to support

964
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:04,020
ipv6 when the cloud providers that

965
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:05,700
they're writing support ipv6 so that's

966
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,800
what I want to tell you I appreciate

967
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,569
this I've been talking about at the the

968
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,460
nanog themes of cooperation working

969
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,170
together as an industry really a

970
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,869
prominent part of what I'm trying to get

971
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,490
at in this presentation but also we're

972
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:20,070
really hoping is if we can work together

973
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:22,700
to promote ipv6 for each other's benefit

974
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:32,790
then we can stop being prisoners of ipv4

975
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:35,520
thank you very much I believe we have

976
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,140
time for questions or comments and there

977
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,190
should be some because I'm talking crazy

978
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:43,500
stuff here guys

979
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:44,490
oh good one of the companies like

980
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,420
somebody from one of the companies I

981
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:49,649
mentioned Louie's gonna say yes we're in

982
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:53,670
we're committing to do all of these

983
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:56,609
things oh go ahead Louie Louie Google

984
00:36:53,670 --> 00:37:07,170
Fiber thank you very much this is great

985
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:10,619
talk we're day one so what I wanted to

986
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:14,190
find out is if any of the companies to

987
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:19,670
talk to talked about v6 on the backend

988
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:19,670
because to the user

989
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:27,420
yeah I've been talking to a lot of

990
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:30,900
enterprises especially about their cloud

991
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,700
hosting and a lot of them are starting

992
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,040
to say gee there are cool things that we

993
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,868
could do with with ipv6 in our data

994
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,029
centers that we can't do in the cloud

995
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:41,400
because all we're getting from our cloud

996
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,960
providers is you know the outside of a

997
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,150
virtual interface as we're getting one

998
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,730
address on a load balancer that doesn't

999
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,650
really do it for the cool internal stuff

1000
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:51,710
one of the best new uses for v6 that

1001
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:54,359
I've seen I saw a great presentation on

1002
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,560
ipv6 for containers where instead of

1003
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,828
doing multiple layers of net if you're

1004
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,119
trying to connect from one container

1005
00:37:56,829 --> 00:37:59,680
machine to another container someplace

1006
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:00,999
else in the data center instead of doing

1007
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,308
that as you go through you could just

1008
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:05,649
use ipv6 you can do cool numbering with

1009
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:09,819
ipv6 but you can't do that if you don't

1010
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:13,059
have ipv6 personally I'm also using so

1011
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:14,769
I'm using for some of my systems you'll

1012
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:17,380
see tools that receive via is hosted on

1013
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:19,988
AWS and the reason is that I can provide

1014
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,789
ipv6 to all my services internally and

1015
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:23,859
externally on AWS they're doing a really

1016
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:26,709
solid job not perfect out 100 percent

1017
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:29,319
but 85 and 90 percent of AWS is v6

1018
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:31,450
capable and and it means that my

1019
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:32,859
management services are also you know

1020
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:38,828
feel a little bit better locked down

1021
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:41,709
with v6 thank you you gotta say

1022
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:43,509
something to the lunatic this is this is

1023
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:45,940
this is madness do you so do people

1024
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:48,549
think that we could actually help each

1025
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:52,150
other in deploying ipv6 would this work

1026
00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:53,469
I mean nobody wants to say anything it's

1027
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,109
Monday morning leave we had a long

1028
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:58,170
weekend the hackathon kept us up all

1029
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:58,170
night

1030
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,229
all right I'm around this week I would

1031
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:10,420
love to talk more and oh wait oh I can't

1032
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:12,098
wait for the Sun hi Lee Peter tim is

1033
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:19,420
with an address like ever love your

1034
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:21,849
price of $50 Oh everything that he

1035
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:25,029
posted was math off the page we call it

1036
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:28,650
hey you haven't seen any of this and

1037
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:34,059
trust me we've watched pretty closely

1038
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:37,209
it's it's one math layer on another

1039
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:40,209
method you extrapolate so far off the

1040
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:42,399
page the end you're posting whatever

1041
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:45,129
that link was to say this is how much

1042
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,309
it'll mean in actual revenue it's not

1043
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:50,890
madness it's not relevant math it

1044
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:53,949
doesn't mean a thing to a person in this

1045
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:56,589
room that's not why people acquire

1046
00:39:53,949 --> 00:40:00,910
addresses it's because it's not

1047
00:39:56,589 --> 00:40:03,308
interoperable so while there is I bet

1048
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:06,038
that 90% of people who have acquired

1049
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:07,800
space or a market place they already

1050
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:10,770
deploy ipv6

1051
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,310
they need it because it's an end not a

1052
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:19,050
nor so I don't know what you're smoking

1053
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:21,750
but man I wish we were so I wish you

1054
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:26,390
were too but it's not relevant this

1055
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:29,940
whole thing was a series of what Evers

1056
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:32,490
no guys it's because it's not

1057
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,780
interoperable go back to well no and I

1058
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,819
said that right I said that might be

1059
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,140
before that you as long as you need IP

1060
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,180
before you're required for

1061
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,890
interoperability absolutely I'm all

1062
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,450
about stability of the internet that's

1063
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,310
why I keep talking about this but no

1064
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:48,180
you're telling people to stop providing

1065
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:51,750
service to their customers deny on glit

1066
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,270
will an app that is paying with v4 the

1067
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,800
network is still what people need to get

1068
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,890
their jobs done so please

1069
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,200
I appreciate your vigor and your your

1070
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:03,690
August way you want to say things and if

1071
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,629
you yell it really loud you hope people

1072
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,260
will believe it none of it was based on

1073
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,500
reality

1074
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:13,110
it really was absolutely noise and a

1075
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,420
peacock so Peter I would be delighted to

1076
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:18,150
take your price numbers over time and

1077
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,950
like all I did was this was extrapolate

1078
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,200
a curve is that is that realistic

1079
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,759
predictions it's an extrapolation it's

1080
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,589
just what it is but that's you can do

1081
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,800
the same thing manages the people's

1082
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:30,480
buying requirements it's because back

1083
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,390
way back in the day and you were

1084
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,050
probably around a 90 in 1996 we all

1085
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:39,240
raised her hands and voted under RFC

1086
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:41,840
1752 that this was gonna be how we're

1087
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,810
gonna go because we were told it was

1088
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:48,150
interoperable and it wasn't so why don't

1089
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:51,450
we back out and say why are we still

1090
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:53,820
propping up a lie I will point out a

1091
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:56,370
question so I do feel like I need to

1092
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,830
push back and say you have a conflict of

1093
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,000
interest here you are motivated to sell

1094
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,770
addresses because that's your business

1095
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,740
no I'm motivated to keep the internet

1096
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:07,020
groaning there's a business model there

1097
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:09,390
you have a model that you're pushing to

1098
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:12,420
look how many people come up here and

1099
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:14,730
push models I'm just saying that no one

1100
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,820
would come to our store if it wasn't

1101
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:20,200
needed trust me there is a real room of

1102
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,240
smart people here which in a way kind of

1103
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,220
Sultan by saying they're stupid not

1104
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,500
doing it they already are they're really

1105
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:30,040
smart and they're making their decisions

1106
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,930
based on their actual business needs no

1107
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,820
one would visit it's not because we're

1108
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,500
nice people it's because they need it

1109
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,300
well from what John said this morning

1110
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,550
most of the people in this room have to

1111
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,990
pull it off eighty-six I don't think I'm

1112
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,520
calling anybody here stupid and if I

1113
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:44,529
have if I've insulted your intelligence

1114
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,359
I apologize for that I was trying to

1115
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:49,450
show yes a potential model for how to

1116
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:52,328
think about this and and to consider

1117
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:53,950
ways to think about whether the whether

1118
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:55,900
there are financial reasons that maybe

1119
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:58,240
you haven't considered before I am not

1120
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,140
telling people not to use ipv4 Alibaba

1121
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:05,020
on a stream what do you get with that

1122
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:06,730
you don't so I'll leave I was announced

1123
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:08,859
for this extravagant year knows we have

1124
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:11,380
a conflict of interest that's because

1125
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:14,348
we're transparent about it but the issue

1126
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,880
is then when you're buying you know it's

1127
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:19,750
you're doing because your business

1128
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:23,410
requires it I can't sell air it doesn't

1129
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:25,630
exist in that vacuum of of stupidity

1130
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:28,270
they're doing things for their business

1131
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,190
so please I love the price point and if

1132
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:33,420
you want to pay $50 a number give me a

1133
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:36,730
call but that's not real either and

1134
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:39,400
that's where you stopped off and jump

1135
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,859
way off the page in your comparison data

1136
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,290
and that's all I'm asking is everyone

1137
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:46,810
back out then math and start to see that

1138
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,520
it's literally a house of cards and I

1139
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:50,740
don't know who here really looked at

1140
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,210
that math but go dig into it because

1141
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,439
that is where I'm starting with that's

1142
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:56,170
why I provided the tools is so you can

1143
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,300
dig into it a lot of these are I'm using

1144
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:00,280
numbers that are here's a basis for

1145
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,260
using these numbers but make up your own

1146
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,839
numbers absolutely and as as you and I

1147
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:08,160
both know we can talk for a long time on

1148
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:08,160
this subject Thank You Lee

1149
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:17,110
yeah one last one if I may Anton

1150
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,890
cappella edge micro thanks Lee did I

1151
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:23,170
have you seek backwards to slide 16 laid

1152
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:25,810
out some basic numbers on kind of a

1153
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:28,600
scale on the magnitude and I want to ask

1154
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:31,480
if you can talk a bit more about this

1155
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:34,960
because I'm curious if you can say maybe

1156
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,370
more specifically what kind of is piece

1157
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,960
segment yeah there we go

1158
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:39,730
what kind of is piece segment are we

1159
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,230
thinking of when we think of being

1160
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:43,090
numbers or look at the numbers you put

1161
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:46,360
here like if you can narrow that down at

1162
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:49,330
all so when I looked at at the hardware

1163
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:51,940
for cgn I'll be honest I looked at

1164
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:53,470
Google Shopping sure and I looked up and

1165
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,240
I said what's the price for various

1166
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,520
different cgn appliances that I know of

1167
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,220
and so they're showing me retail prices

1168
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,680
sure so maybe your price is 200 instead

1169
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:05,500
of a thousand I don't know what I don't

1170
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,299
want to masquerade an opinion as a

1171
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,370
question but I'm just gonna say he might

1172
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,430
be off by two orders of magnitude or

1173
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:14,529
greater miss assumption yep it's

1174
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:15,940
possible interestingly when I did this

1175
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,070
ten years ago I was looking back to my

1176
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:21,010
old slides the price for hardware that I

1177
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:22,510
quoted was $15,000 sure so maybe it's

1178
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,920
you think it's might maybe you think

1179
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:26,860
maybe it's a hundred dollars or ten

1180
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,150
dollars just a case in point I mean I

1181
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,640
don't use this stuff and I don't

1182
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,230
advocate it so don't confuse that this

1183
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,480
this next thing I'm gonna say with it

1184
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:37,060
but for ten or fifteen dollars my

1185
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,100
critics making little dinky MIPS and ARM

1186
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,259
chips push the gigabit through a Linux

1187
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:43,450
kernel and it's mostly fast passed and

1188
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:45,190
blah blah blah efficient you know log

1189
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:47,049
log lookup tries and all that cool stuff

1190
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:50,290
so you know a million sessions and a

1191
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:51,940
half gig of ram is doable and I'm not

1192
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,830
doing it but there are wisps out there

1193
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,930
and cellco is a plenty putting a hundred

1194
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:58,330
thousand you know two hundred thousand

1195
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:59,740
flows through a ten dollar das or a VM

1196
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,299
somewhere and you Lee this is this

1197
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,669
really patches that you know the entire

1198
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,170
thing together I'm not advocating for it

1199
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:07,540
but what I'm what I'm curious about is

1200
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,980
you know is that price point as high as

1201
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,670
we think it is and is that maybe why no

1202
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:14,080
one's racing to do us more rapidly and

1203
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:16,270
that is a perfectly fair reasonable

1204
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,069
great point even I do think that the

1205
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:21,040
numbers are different for mobile

1206
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:22,770
carriers than fixed broadband ISPs and I

1207
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,210
don't know exactly because I

1208
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:26,790
know exactly how the traffic works

1209
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,560
mobile sites tend to be smaller so they

1210
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,430
may be as many objects but less

1211
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,049
bandwidth or they're more they're

1212
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:33,089
optimized differently but they want to

1213
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:36,900
submit react into the browser now right

1214
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:38,880
yeah so so so does that work out that's

1215
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,160
kind of by the way I'm hoping I haven't

1216
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,410
put us put it up yet I do want to put up

1217
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,910
a cgn calculator like this so that you

1218
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:46,620
can plug into your own hardware costs

1219
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:48,299
and so on the one in buttock thing I'd

1220
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,170
love to see you work on her ad add to

1221
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,880
something like this would be a

1222
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,800
regression question or call a stress

1223
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,690
test what happens if the price falls out

1224
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,630
and all the stuff we think is expensive

1225
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:59,010
Oh introduced yeah something like that

1226
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:02,240
yeah that would be fun

1227
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,240
thanks Lee thank you

1228
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:10,319
[Applause]

1229
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,390
you
