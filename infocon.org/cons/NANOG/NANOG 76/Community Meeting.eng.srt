1
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,230
good morning everyone how are you folks

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,550
enjoying the meeting

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:22,750
good good so this marks the 25th

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:26,320
anniversary of Nanak so 25 years ago a

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,840
collection of very bright young kind of

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,399
hungry engineers got into a room and

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,980
decided they were going to try to make

8
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:36,420
the internet work across the North

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:40,750
America and as a result here we are

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,340
their accomplishments been amazing I was

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,570
speaking to one of our board members and

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,350
he was in the or one of the early

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:49,180
meetings and he said that at that time

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,670
there are about you know 60 people in a

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,790
room and if someone had blown up that

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,730
room the internet would have died in

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,829
North America and the way it's grown

18
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,379
today there's no way you could just take

19
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:04,659
out the internet in North America there

20
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,630
are hundreds of thousands of engineers

21
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:09,430
and there are people with an industry

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,020
that makes the United States and across

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,950
the world an amazing place for

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:18,609
information sharing across the world

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:21,280
about 30 years ago I was in a conference

26
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:22,869
and there was a futurist who spoke and

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,179
he was talking about the challenges that

28
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:26,590
we'd be facing in the future and he said

29
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:29,859
the biggest challenge that we would face

30
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:33,509
is that the amount of information that

31
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:37,270
we had he said that in the 1600s a

32
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:40,359
well-educated man would have been able

33
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:44,229
to read everything that was written

34
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:46,600
within their lifetime he also wanted to

35
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,579
say that in one edition of the New York

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,788
Times would be impossible for someone to

37
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:53,199
consume it all in a singular day he said

38
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:56,380
the biggest challenge that would be

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,459
facing humanity is the management of

40
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:03,339
data and information and he said the

41
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:06,310
major careers that do not exist now will

42
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,819
be designed and focused in managing that

43
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:12,760
information and here we are with the

44
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:14,649
internet and everyone in this room

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,160
contributes in some way to that

46
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,959
information flow managing that data so

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,640
because of you people throughout North

48
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,670
America and the world have the privilege

49
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,440
of having access to information in ways

50
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,989
that we never could have imagined

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,400
before so I want to give a round of

52
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,350
applause to all but everything in the

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:42,130
room and to all those people who helped

54
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:45,970
make this happen so as non-executive

55
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:50,290
director one of my mandates is that

56
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:53,890
regarding to outreach where's my click

57
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:57,940
out there thank you was in regards to

58
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,470
outreach now my cousin organization has

59
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,120
grown over the years and in the

60
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,790
beginning because it was small it's

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,180
finding its way it was kind of insular

62
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:10,480
and so one of my goals is to start to

63
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,900
reach out within the community I think

64
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,049
that for a healthy thriving community it

65
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,350
has to be built upon diversity inclusion

66
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,510
and acceptance the more voices that we

67
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,390
get into this room the better for all of

68
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,799
us and as you look across the room we

69
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,779
have new people here but there's a lot

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,140
of people who've been around for a while

71
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,540
and it's my desire and outreach is to

72
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,760
create an environment where new people

73
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,470
want to comment and then I want to be a

74
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,700
part of this community and hope to

75
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,650
continue the growth of the internet

76
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,630
within this country I had the pleasure

77
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,700
of talking to Vince Cerf once and he was

78
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,560
telling me I asked him a question what

79
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,238
was the thing that just surprised him

80
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,430
the most about the internet what was the

81
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,470
thing when they put it all together that

82
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,239
they just never thought of and he said

83
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,769
we never considered the commercial

84
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,989
application it never occurred to us and

85
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,519
I believe that there are applications of

86
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,590
the Internet there things will happen a

87
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,680
technology that we in this room cannot

88
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:14,110
conceive of but our children and those

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,298
who come after us will conceive of those

90
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,310
things and will continue to advance the

91
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,349
internet so one of the core things in

92
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,240
our outreach is bringing people within

93
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,490
the community within the environment

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,220
where were those new ideas will come in

95
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,380
where when we decide that we've gonna go

96
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,870
on out to pasture there'll be a whole

97
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,120
group of young innovative people who

98
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,260
will continue the work that has made the

99
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,200
internet the success it is today

100
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,409
so what is

101
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,260
a college education the core of Nanak's

102
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,450
mission and outreach programs reflect

103
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,580
that mission they are designed and

104
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,159
taught by industry professionals and and

105
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:55,520
we are committed to the advancement of

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,610
the Internet in North America what is

107
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,370
our focus our outreach programs focus in

108
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,770
three distinct areas there is an

109
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,800
industry education for networking

110
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,140
professionals education career

111
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,450
development and for colleges and

112
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,390
graduate students and training within

113
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,700
underserved regions of North America now

114
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:20,719
most of us live here in large cities and

115
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:23,030
we have tremendous access within our

116
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,650
communities my home particularly I have

117
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:29,150
I think it's 300 down and 30 up but then

118
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:34,450
I have a house it's in a rural area

119
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:38,210
where I get ten down and I get 0.75

120
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:42,229
megabits up Valerie gets I think she

121
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,359
said about three down on a good day but

122
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,450
still that's access there are certain

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,910
parts of North America that have little

124
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,650
to no access at all how many of you had

125
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,030
the pleasure being in Matt's talk

126
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,299
regarding what's happening in the

127
00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:00,049
indigenous regions did you guys enjoy

128
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,430
that talk okay well now Don's gonna be

129
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,660
kind of supporting some of those efforts

130
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,660
which I'll be talking about in a minute

131
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,609
our goal choose to operate our outreach

132
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,970
programs within the in the most

133
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,990
strategic way possible nanog has a 501 3

134
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:21,200
C 3 designation as a nonprofit and our

135
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,990
focus is on education now my personal

136
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,349
beliefs about nonprofits is they exist

137
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:30,260
in this realm between commercial

138
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,080
entities and government entities there

139
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,180
are things that nonprofits can do that

140
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,820
need to government's nor commercial

141
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,670
entities can do commercial entities are

142
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,190
designed to drive a profit they have a

143
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:46,610
fiduciary responsibility to their

144
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,830
shareholders to make a profit there are

145
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,230
certain things they're not within their

146
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,198
bandwidth to do certain things which are

147
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,430
not profitable enterprises

148
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,370
governments on the other hand are

149
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,560
sometimes too large to be able to focus

150
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,620
on certain small targeted goals and

151
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,389
that's where nonprofits come in

152
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,060
nonprofits are about doing good for

153
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,530
those communities that they serve and

154
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,470
our outreach programs are going to be

155
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,210
focused on that again I said we think we

156
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,580
focused on our core misses with your

157
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,580
education we're mindful of non augs

158
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,900
resources unlike some organizations in

159
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,359
our community we don't have this

160
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,520
automated flow of revenue that comes in

161
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,260
our revenue comes in from support from

162
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,840
our members and also from our

163
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,930
sponsorship programs we're gonna focus

164
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,049
on providing educational support to

165
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,220
Nog's industry organizations

166
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,510
universities and underserved regions

167
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,539
within North America our previous

168
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:47,630
efforts like Nanog on the road

169
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:50,630
operations we're gonna try to focus

170
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,550
those efforts try to use our resources

171
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,350
as best we can possible

172
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,020
we're looking to partner with entities

173
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,270
in North America so that we can leverage

174
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:04,130
those groups and to be able to offer

175
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:06,020
more with less in most cases these

176
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,840
organizations will provide the venues

177
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:13,130
marketing and audience and we will

178
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:15,109
provide the educational support so we've

179
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,270
had a couple of encounters this year so

180
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,330
far within our outreach and I'll talk

181
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,599
about a couple of those the first thing

182
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,419
we did is we offered support to the crib

183
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,180
nog crib nog is of course within North

184
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:31,570
America we do focus on North American

185
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,950
entities that are english-speaking

186
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,539
Mexico is part of North America but

187
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:41,930
because of the language barriers they

188
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:45,290
tend to reflect with latnok so in crib

189
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:47,930
not there were experts global

190
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,180
stakeholders across Caribbean United

191
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:54,199
States nor Canada

192
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,569

I spoke did the keynote and talked about

196
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:05,859
the role of nogs within our communities

197
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:12,980

198

199
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,630
learning manners and best practices for

200
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,209
migrating global routing threats

201
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,660
Steve Feldman also a member and former

203
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,360
insights into the global DNS attack that

204
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,600
it recently happened Eddie Winstead also

205
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,100
a

206
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,700
nanog member and a longtime volunteer he

207
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:43,660
spoke on so he inherited DNS server best

208
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:47,899
practices from day one day Harvey and I

209
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:50,719
Dave puts on our meetings so des does in

210
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:53,839
her team do an amazing job of delivering

211
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,730
these meetings when I first came on as

212
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,190
executive director and I really got to

213
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,470
peer into what all happened to make

214
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,360
these meetings take place I was amazed

215
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,910
at the time the staff is three people

216
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,830
that Betty Day and Valerie we're able to

217
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,290
put on these tremendous meetings with

218
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,510
just that small course the staff and the

219
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,490
assistants of Hamilton group so data is

220
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,140
amazing job and I'd like to thank Dave

221
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,990
for all her work and effort and Valerie

222
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:21,430
and the team that put this together

223
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:24,290
[Applause]

224
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,149
so then I went to write to see what we

225
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,430
can learn about the things that they do

226
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:31,190
we're trying to always make sure we're

227
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,859
delivering the best to our attendees so

228
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,410
this was an opportunity to see how our

229
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,450
neighbors across the pond manage their

230
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,100
events now ripe is a little different

231
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,120
than us it's kind of an amalgamation of

232
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:47,450
both nanog and aaron combined together

233
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,209
so we you know met with ripe training

234
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:53,180
team one of the things again education

235
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:54,529
is our core so ripe has a training

236
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,359
program that's been going on for quite a

237
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:58,070
while so I wanted to see how they do

238
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,980
things how they do things that are

239
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,770
different than what we do and well you

240
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,440
understand what I mean and what we can

241
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:09,740
do to collaborate with them in an effort

242
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,899
to bolster our training and educational

243
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,209
programs we're not in competition with

244
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:16,250
one another we're all about doing what's

245
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:17,959
the best for the internet as a whole so

246
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,920
I think that there's an opportunity to

247
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,599
deliver

248
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:26,060
create synergy between our two

249
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:31,550
organizations so upcoming outreach

250
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:34,910
meetings so this fall prior to going

251
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,800
into our meeting in Austin we're working

252
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:41,240
to solidify a date to have an outreach

253
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,130
meeting at Texas A&M we will use this

254
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,910
opportunity to build awareness around a

255
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:49,070
Nana as an organization for students the

256
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,870
wealth of tools resources and

257
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,840
programming that the programs that are

258
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,320
available in are trying at try annual

259
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,930
meeting excuse me we're looking to

260
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,880
provide students with that we're looking

261
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,160
to encourage them to participate in our

262
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,810
NCI program and we're looking to provide

263
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,270
information regarding our career

264
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,010
opportunities and industry challenges

265
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:15,410
and within our various organizations

266
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:16,880
within our community Cribb nog 18 so

267
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,949
we're also going to be going to crib nob

268
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,330
offer a bit of an educational support to

269
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:26,090
them as well to help bolster their

270
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:29,360
efforts in the Caribbean and the

271
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:32,660
indigenous connectivity subnet in Hilo

272
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,780
Hawaii so I know some of you people say

273
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:39,050
Oh Hilo Hawaii boondoggle why are we

274
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:43,850
participating why we are part of that on

275
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:45,589
the Big Island of Hawaii they're areas

276
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,830
and even some of the smaller higher what

277
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:51,080
they do not have access this is a

278
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,260
problem I mean there's a problem in

279
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,030
First Nations people up in Canada and

280
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,280
tribal areas within the United States

281
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,720
there are areas that not only do they

282
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,920
have not internet access they don't even

283
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,200
have power and we can't build those

284
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,579
networks we can't fix this problem for

285
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,890
them but what we can do as an

286
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,990
educational institution we can help

287
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,939
support their efforts help bring up

288
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,530
engineers who can out build out those

289
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,510
networks and change those communities

290
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,160
we're not in the business of building

291
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,050
networks we're in the business of

292
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,140
building the human network and that's

293
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:27,620
why you're all here to learn to grow and

294
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,000
to enhance your careers and we're trying

295
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,300
to give that opportunity to other people

296
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,300
as well

297
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:40,979
so they like program the Nanog program

298
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:44,130
is fuelled by people within this room

299
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:48,360
and people within this community we have

300
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:51,030
a deep passion about Nanog they impart

301
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,030
from their daily responsibilities step

302
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:57,470
in and volunteer their time to assure

303
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:01,100
that this program is informative

304
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:03,780
credible and on the leading edge

305
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,280
I'd like to everyone who's part of the

306
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,900
program committing in this room to

307
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,900
please just stand up for a moment

308
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:28,710
they're shy I think the core of nanog is

309
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,959
the program committee I believe that

310
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,870
with the right program we could hold it

311
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,990
in a tent in a field with people in

312
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:40,230
sleeping bags and they would come it's

313
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,210
core to what we do and I deeply

314
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,750
appreciate and respect the efforts that

315
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:47,580
the program hoody committee puts into

316
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,950
building this manag community keeping

317
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,120
people coming and and participating

318
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:56,160
within the organization on average our

319
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,710
audience is broken about a third of

320
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,439
people are new coming in a third who are

321
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,330
members and then another community which

322
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,339
you know who aren't members but who are

323
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,800
part and participate in that on all the

324
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,870
time and our program community keeps

325
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,890
them coming and coming and coming so

326
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:16,440
again thank you for your efforts so as I

327
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:18,330
mentioned again before that the program

328
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,280
is the heart of an event on it's made of

329
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:23,010
the industry professionals and is

330
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,380
selected by the board and within that

331
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,930
self that the program committee self

332
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,970
organize itself and then selects and

333
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,349
promotes its own members decides what

334
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,780
committees were going to be inside of

335
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,150
the organization and they determine what

336
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,520
this program is going to look like the

337
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,740
piece he reviews and so the selected

338
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,050
talks amended by the nanog community to

339
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,220
curate a program of the highest possible

340
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,750
quality and relevance

341
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,980
in an effort to better serve our

342
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:53,240
community the PC has created some new

343
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,230
subcommittees and effort took better

344
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,690
serve our community keynote speakers I

345
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,930
had asked the committee if they could

346
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,670
try to focus on being a little more

347
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,888
proactive as in terms of reacted to our

348
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,349
content and thus they've created a

349
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:11,240
committee on keynote speakers it's been

350
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,480
quite successful we've got several

351
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,430
candidates for the upcoming meeting in

352
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,990
Austin and there's other meetings

353
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,579
already where there's keynote speakers

354
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:23,660
who are interested in contributing to

355
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:25,189
our our program so the new subcommittees

356
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,779
they've created again keynote speakers

357
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:31,550
women in tech or outreach programs

358
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:34,880
lightning talks the tutorial attracts

359
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:37,069
and also a hackathon I believe that the

360
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,070
hackathon is a key element of the nanite

361
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:42,290
program it's been steadily growing and I

362
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,880
think it is Wiest it starts to grow and

363
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,250
we better defined it I think it's gonna

364
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,680
be a key component of bringing new

365
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,269
people into our organization and getting

366
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,430
excited about what we're doing and

367
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:56,389
helped to promote the organization in a

368
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:59,120
much more complete manner these

369
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:00,920
subcommittees allow the various types of

370
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,110
expertise to focus on knowledge on

371
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:11,480
specific areas importance within the

372
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:13,490
Nanog program so Nanog wants you we want

373
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,709
you to be a part of this we want you to

374
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,230
join become members we want you to

375
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:20,120
participate in the program so again it's

376
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,270
about building the future it's about

377
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:26,599
ensuring that nanog will be around

378
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:28,250
beyond ourselves I'd like you all to

379
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,340
face a challenge of getting involved in

380
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:35,870
a broader scale participate in ways such

381
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:39,199
as vote become a member I work for you

382
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:42,250
guys I am here to serve your needs and

383
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,100
to make this program this organization

384
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:48,290
the most the best program it can be but

385
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,209
I need your support and making that

386
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,770
happen

387
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:55,520
membership is not about what little

388
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,408
tchotchkes you get or what we can do for

389
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,010
you it's about turning around and what

390
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,559
you can

391
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,940
for the community so voting is critical

392
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,250
and to vote you need to be a member

393
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,790
membership fee is hundred dollars a year

394
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:11,929
for non students fifty dollars a year

395
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:13,549
for students it's minuscule I've got me

396
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:14,870
most of you if I have taken out dinner

397
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:17,480
for your family and spent more money

398
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,100
than that so it's a small thing but it's

399
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,280
a part of contributing and being part of

400
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,949
our program mentor as I mentioned before

401
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,160
that we have one third in this

402
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,919
particular conference there are 250 new

403
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,929
people that came to this conference in

404
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,790
addition when you count all the students

405
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:36,530
in there that another 50 that our

406
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,928
students so you're looking about 300

407
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,928
people roaming throughout here who've

408
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:43,880
never been to an AA meeting before and

409
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,020
for some of us who are more experienced

410
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,960
have been around it's a great

411
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,510
opportunity to mentor Susan is on our

412
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,100
board and spoken on the women Tech

413
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,140
meetings you talk about the significance

414
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,510
and importance of mentorship and how

415
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,910
it's great for any organization that

416
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,740
participates in such programs so here's

417
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,179
an opportunity for you to get back to

418
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,669
mentor someone else help guide their

419
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:06,200
career helped shape the people of

420
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:07,910
tomorrow so that they can make sure that

421
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,309
everything continues all your efforts

422
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:15,679
don't go in vain teach for about 15

423
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:20,690
years of my life I had the privilege of

424
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:24,770
teaching I learned more from my students

425
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:27,679
than they ever learned from me teaching

426
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:31,220
is a way of not just giving back it gets

427
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:34,850
back to you it takes your knowledge it

428
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:37,100
amplifies it when you're teaching and

429
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,949
someone asks you a question it makes

430
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,918
sometimes it turns what you know upside

431
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,790
down and makes you look at it in another

432
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,890
way teaching is about you it's about

433
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,720
expanding your knowledge and sharing

434
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,640
that knowledge of someone else there are

435
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,730
often things we do repetitively every

436
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,010
day we do it intuitively but we do not

437
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,140
understand the rationale behind what we

438
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,690
do you get in front of someone and you

439
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,660
teach they will demand that you give

440
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:08,360
them the rationale of how you got to

441
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,910
where you are and in that you understand

442
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,340
what you do in a more significant manner

443
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:16,710
present we need presenters we need

444
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:20,340
people who can share their ideas their

445
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:24,150
concepts submit your talks submit your

446
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,280
ideas it helps you again as I mentioned

447
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,500
for it and it's it's a form of teaching

448
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,810
it makes you take and organize your

449
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,920
thoughts in a cohesive manner and it

450
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,669
takes that information and it will

451
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,060
enhance you get involved present make

452
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,820
this community even better

453
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:44,820
evaluate serve on the program committee

454
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,679
it is that it is again as I said core to

455
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,960
organization core what we do and that

456
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:53,220
program committee is the lifeblood of

457
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,410
this organization and sponsor nanog is

458
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,490
an organization that exists upon the

459
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:01,470
support of members and also our sponsors

460
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:04,260
your efforts those investments allow us

461
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,030
to do other things on us to teach these

462
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,560
people in the room allow us to put on

463
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,330
these conferences without that

464
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,510
sponsorship dollars it doesn't happen

465
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:14,310
even for you of attending here the money

466
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,160
that you spend for registration does not

467
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,750
cover all the expenses that go to not

468
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,740
just putting on the conference but to

469
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:29,310
just feeding you sponsors support those

470
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:34,590
efforts so I'll leave you with a quote

471
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:36,330
from Robert Kennedy the future does not

472
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,870
belong to those who are content with

473
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:42,000
today apathetic toward comic problems

474
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:45,209
and their fellow man alike timid and

475
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,940
fearful in the face of bold projects and

476
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:51,090
new ideas rather it will belong to those

477
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:55,940
who can blend passion reason and courage

478
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,939
in a personal commitment to their ideas

479
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,550
thank you and hopefully we're all

480
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:07,230
working together for the Internet of

481
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:11,480
tomorrow so

482
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:13,950
[Applause]
