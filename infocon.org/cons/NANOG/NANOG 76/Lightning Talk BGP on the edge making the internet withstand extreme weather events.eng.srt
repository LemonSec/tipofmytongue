1
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:17,000
hi everybody first thank you for having

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,640
me I want to clear up any misconceptions

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,980
that may be there I'm not a masters

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,259
champion that's Tiger Woods I wear this

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,970
to remind everyone and encourage

6
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:29,180
everyone to think green in your

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,790
day-to-day activities we've got a lot of

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,829
changes to make in the world and in our

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,600
network infrastructure in order to be

10
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:38,360
able to withstand the challenges that

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,460
are coming in in the decades that we'll

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:49,400
pass to make sure that our systems don't

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:52,370
fail so in that thought you know in 2003

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,290
my networks it wasn't big you know just

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,239
and still not big I have my mail servers

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,570
my name servers those types of things on

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,620
my rack a couple of web servers

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,040
hurricane Frances came and just knocked

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:06,200
me over no power no network upstream no

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,869
nothing for weeks and it was really

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,020
debilitating so at that point I I

22
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,509
started building solar net one we got

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,908
some solar panels and some batteries and

24
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:18,680
we did some work to make the the Network

25
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:22,370
host efficient enough that we can do

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,500
that on a small scale both economically

27
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,080
and with five nines of uptime on the

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,580
power supply and I thought great I'm all

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,860
set the next hurricane comes I'm not

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,210
gonna have a problem and so then the

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,549
next hurricane came and it knocked me

32
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,520
over again only it didn't knock me over

33
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:39,020
not the upstream carriers over and I

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,330
can't fault him for that by any stretch

35
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,729
of the imagination nobody is prepared

36
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,039
for those type of events all of you

37
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,780
network operators I'm sure have to deal

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,290
with situations like fires earthquakes

39
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,640
hurricanes tornadoes flooding

40
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,590
particularly recently and the effects

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,729
upon your networks and mitigating those

42
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,890
effects so I said to myself okay well

43
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,170
looks like I have to actually up my ante

44
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,780
here on the network side and go get some

45
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,869
IP addresses in a yes and multi-home my

46
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,729
site so that when when one of my

47
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,980
upstream carriers goes down my rack

48
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,040
doesn't go down with it because I sat

49
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,988
and kind of rode out hurricane Matthew I

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,548
was in Colorado at the time but my

51
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,200
networks just kept running because of

52
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:23,180
the large battery bank and the solar

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,679
power raid etc so

54
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,860
I said okay let's see what we can do

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,840
went to got back from Colorado and then

56
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,140
the next year hurricane Irma comes and

57
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,849
says nope you're going down again same

58
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:43,279
reason upstream connectivity fails I'm

59
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:45,048
getting my P addresses from them and now

60
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,519
my rack doesn't work anymore sure I can

61
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,470
use my redundant connections to get kind

62
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:51,109
of user level services call for help and

63
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,439
things like that but the core of my

64
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:57,220
communications infrastructure was down

65
00:02:53,439 --> 00:03:00,290
so I'm now kind of on the journey of

66
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:04,519
solving this problem and when I look at

67
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:07,730
it I say oK we've got a large number of

68
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,480
a s is in my general area some small

69
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,209
network operators some universe these

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,518
municipalities those types of things

71
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,930
some of these will stay up for an

72
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,689
extended period of time because they

73
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,280
have generators and some will fail

74
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:23,060
because they can't get fuel to those

75
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,859
generators

76
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,819
some have varies and sort of network

77
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:28,879
connections that are gonna fail

78
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:32,290
notwithstanding because of damage to

79
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:36,138
lines or other similar kind of outages

80
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:39,530
what the goal of the whole project is to

81
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:42,769
make it all resilient so that not only

82
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:47,299
me my small operation but emergency

83
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:50,269
services other enterprises and small

84
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:52,970
businesses can stay up or at least not

85
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,889
have to do major repairs to their

86
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,049
networks to recover from these natural

87
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:59,389
disasters if we can keep everything up

88
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,579
that's great if we can minimize repairs

89
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:03,769
well that's probably acceptable at this

90
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:05,329
point because everybody is doing a lot

91
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,549
of things when a hurricane comes and

92
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:10,099
knocks you over or when a tornado swipes

93
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,750
through your town when the river is five

94
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:13,099
feet too high and now you've got a

95
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,180
problem with some of your underground

96
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:21,199
cables and things like that in this

97
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,479
process what I found is that it's very

98
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,830
difficult to encourage some of the

99
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:29,000
carriers that are going to be connecting

100
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:33,380
these small businesses and other

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,240
entities to do a simple Network peer to

102
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,990
announce address space and provide that

103
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,039
redundancy

104
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:42,500
that is built into bgp and of course you

105
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,900
know bgp in this room to most everybody

106
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,310
means okay we're gonna go into the i-x

107
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,448
we're gonna connect everybody else we're

108
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,660
gonna have all our routes we're gonna be

109
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:53,090
good but there's the additional use case

110
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,530
that was built into the spec originally

111
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,099
which is to provide a multihoming

112
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,448
redundancy to the networks to prevent

113
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,740
this type of thing so like this is a

114
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:05,330
technical challenge that's already been

115
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,919
solved but in order to actually route

116
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,520
the packers correctly we not only have

117
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,969
to have the edge carriers cooperate with

118
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,750
that

119
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,940
well we need to either have that or we

120
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,400
need to have some methodology by which

121
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:23,500
we can tunnel to internet exchange

122
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,330
points end or other naps knocks that can

123
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,409
terminate that traffic and send it out

124
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:32,150
to its ultimate destination and this is

125
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:35,569
kind of the point of my talk here is

126
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,520
that we need to evolve our view of BGP a

127
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:40,820
little bit and take it out of the data

128
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,820
center and put it out onto the edge not

129
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,889
in all cases not in any of your cases

130
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,780
particularly except those carriers who

131
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:51,289
are providing end-user services and

132
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,929
things like that all you guys need to do

133
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,199
is be a little more receptive to being

134
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,849
able to peer with your standard customer

135
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,620
because he needs to be able to make

136
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:04,190
redundancy happen he needs to be able to

137
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,719
ensure that his network stay up in some

138
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,240
cases this isn't gonna be possible I

139
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:09,889
understand I've had situations where

140
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,409
carriers say we won't do it I've had

141
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:13,969
situations where carriers say we don't

142
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:16,039
have the infrastructure in place to be

143
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:19,219
able to do it even if we wanted to but

144
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,979
we're willing to look at it so the

145
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:25,340
solution that I've kind of come to is

146
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:29,150
that it's gonna be very expensive for

147
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:33,799
many small operators to build into

148
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:37,429
exchanges and connecting in traditional

149
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,270
fashion as they would in the IXP so if

150
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:44,479
we can take and make a situation where

151
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,070
the small operator can tunnel to this

152
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,080
data center this data center in this

153
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,169
data center to announce his addresses

154
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,219
and route its route

155
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:56,969
then over a standard you know commercial

156
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:59,840
class Network circuit then it will make

157
00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:02,879
it much easier to provide a robust

158
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:07,169
solution to that customer if we can

159
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:10,409
encourage through the community the on a

160
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:13,590
community scale even a microwave length

161
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:17,569
link between to a s's can provide

162
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:20,878
connectivity to one if the other fails

163
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:24,060
in any of their upstream connections so

164
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,189
in the interest of keeping emergency

165
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,919
services small businesses and other

166
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:31,949
things in the communities rely upon as

167
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:37,198
functional as possible in the case of

168
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:39,629
the ever increasing natural disaster

169
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,819
events I would encourage all of you to

170
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:45,000
do everything you can to help those

171
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,279
operators who are trying to make their

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,240
systems redundant push BGP out to the

173
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:56,189
edge and allow the redundant function of

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,490
that that was built into the

175
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:01,409
specification to be enjoyed by a wider

176
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,699
range of network operators other than

177
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:04,589
just you know I see the top of the

178
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,569
pyramid of networking in this room I

179
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:08,339
understand all of you guys having

180
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,629
multiple redundant power systems

181
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:11,759
multiple redundant connections to

182
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,469
everything you have it all automated and

183
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,169
very well organized so that it doesn't

184
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:18,300
fail and that's great but when the end

185
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,789
user still can't use the network when he

186
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,169
really needs to do it that's when we

187
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:25,128
need to push the engineering a little

188
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,389
further out and try to accommodate that

189
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,979
that's really kind of all I have to say

190
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,319
if anybody has any questions I think we

191
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:33,958
are holding those till the end so I'm

192
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,829
gonna yield whatever minute 43 I have

193
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,750
left to the next figure

194
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:38,549
thank you everyone I appreciate your

195
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,479
time

196
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,478
[Applause]

197
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,750
you
