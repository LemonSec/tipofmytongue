1
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:20,230
good afternoon everyone I'm sad to say

2
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:24,580
that this presentation doesn't have any

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:27,970
cat pictures while I was making this

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:30,790
presentation I realized that thirty-one

5
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:34,690
nano meetings ago I did my last

6
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:40,570
lightning talk at nog which was about

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:43,449
home routers breaking ipv6 and so 10

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:46,750
years on and 31 now meetings later I'm

9
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:51,579
back on stage speaking about home

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:54,609
routers that break ipv6 I guess there's

11
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:57,780
a lesson in there I think I'm gonna

12
00:00:54,609 --> 00:01:03,699
start on the title for my my

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:07,590
presentation at Nanog 107 in October of

14
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:11,020
2029 it's gonna be something with ipv6

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,630
so today's topic I've used six adoption

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,039
is killing my food that sounds weird

17
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,939
because I'd be steaks supposed to be

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,299
faster and better it right so a tale of

19
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:24,669
two pipelines so this is my home

20
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,170
connection and for some of you have a

21
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,000
DSL connection might want to leave the

22
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,210
room because you're going to be sickened

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,180
by the numbers in this presentation I'm

24
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,908
truly blessed I live in a city in a

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,700
country where I get a symmetrical 1-gig

26
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:42,390
fiber-to-the-home connection and it

27
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,369
costs me about five hundred bucks a year

28
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,170
that's brilliant right there's a snack

29
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:51,250
though it's a municipal fiber build and

30
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,560
it's shared between a whole bunch of

31
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,899
providers so they have to do some

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,399
trickery to make sure that the right

33
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:59,200
customer ends up at the right provider

34
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,829
then typically they use like two

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,320
different options one is pppoe which is

36
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:08,579
typically done for p4 ISPs they already

37
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:12,310
run like the cell network in the area

38
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:16,630
then the other one is a native Ethernet

39
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:20,610
solution but using DHCP option 82 the

40
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,359
DHCP relay stuff for provisioning which

41
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,180
links your

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,770
a cheapie public key for net address to

43
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:33,010
a VLAN in some god-awful way that works

44
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,530
for ipv4 just fine the only problem is I

45
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,989
now have this super duper super modern

46
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:43,810
internet connection at home that doesn't

47
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:45,490
do in 85 pv6 okay but yeah well there's

48
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,090
no issue right I mean we've developed

49
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:51,940
six rd for exactly this purpose and what

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:56,860
we ever needs 15 or buy temps use anyway

51
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:59,260
and all CPS these days support GRE so

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,980
that should be fine right it's usually

53
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,540
in hardware so but here we end up with

54
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,369
the two separate pipelines inside of

55
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,829
your CP the one is hardware accelerated

56
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:13,030
which is for typically ipv4 forwarding

57
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:16,540
not see v6 forwarding people yoyi IPSec

58
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,940
Jerry what's not hardware accelerated is

59
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,280
stuff like wire guard because it's

60
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:28,079
simply two new Open VPN because there's

61
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:33,370
too many buttons and ipv6 in ipv4 GRE

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:38,440
and that as more and more content is

63
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:41,260
shifting towards ipv6 if you have a dual

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,370
stack at home gives you an interesting

65
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:50,798
challenge because this is what my CP

66
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:53,170
looks like if I'm using ipv4 my CPU

67
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,890
utilization is pretty much next to

68
00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:00,040
nothing and I get like 900 something

69
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:08,548
Meg's of throughput out of my uplink

70
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:12,010
which is pretty good but this is ipv6

71
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,810
I'm pegging out the CPU at maximum

72
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:18,728
utilization it turns into a bit of a

73
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:23,200
space heater and I'm I'm hurting to get

74
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:26,520
170 Meg's of fruit boot and since more

75
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,680
and more content is moving to ipv6

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:35,169
actually performance of of Internet in

77
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,030
my home is going down so conclusions are

78
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:39,599
this well

79
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:43,169
HTP option 82 which some quite a few net

80
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,560
we're still uses it's not perfect more

81
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:52,020
to the point is the p4 p6 parity in

82
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:55,230
hardware is still not there and until it

83
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,719
until it's this is fixed the more people

84
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:02,400
implement ipv6 the slower my home

85
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:05,760
connection gets and and anyone who knows

86
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,299
an alternative CPE that doesn't have

87
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,780
this issue I would love to hear from you

88
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,130
and that's it thank you very much

89
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:19,500
[Applause]

90
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:22,590
any questions comments remarks tomatoes

91
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,240
rocks I mean I know coffees waiting

92
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:29,669
outside so I'm it's probably in vain but

93
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,700
I'm not Tony Taylor from Comcast note no

94
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:36,960
expert in DHCP options 62 but what I

95
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:39,270
mean is there some similar magic that

96
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,430
could put you in the right VLAN for v6

97
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:47,969
no well so I mean you you can go to the

98
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,700
ITF and look at the HP v6 and all of the

99
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,790
mess has been going on there DHCP relay

100
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,979
has never been fought off or implemented

101
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,310
in that let alone for a prefix

102
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:05,940
delegation or what have you

103
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:07,800
okay so it's simply not there and I mean

104
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,110
one thing I like to point out is there's

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,850
no pairs no problem for the IASB because

106
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,670
their site is all fully hardware

107
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:17,310
accelerated is just me as a client that

108
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:22,080
ends up getting worse and worse

109
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:23,310
performance anyone else in that case I

110
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,849
wish you all a good coffee break and

111
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,850
thanks for your time

112
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,730
you

113
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,360
you
