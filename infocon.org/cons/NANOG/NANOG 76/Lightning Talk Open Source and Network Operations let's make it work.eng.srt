1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:22,909
all right thank you

2
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:27,149
so many icons so little clarity already

3
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:30,000
no great fun with middle age never have

4
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,500
the right glasses length so open source

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,510
software what's holding you back and

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,600
particularly for network operators of

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,129
all strikes yeah you know open source

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,230
software it tastes great right it's free

9
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,539
software there's so much of it it's

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,608
inspectable code you can break out a

11
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,339
vendor lock-in management knows what

12
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,890
open source software is but it's less

13
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,449
filling so much of it is a been where

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,829
you go where there are six available

15
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,480
products and none of them do quite

16
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,679
exactly the right thing that you you

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,629
need to solve

18
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,260
there is no vendor there's no one you

19
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,640
can call to fix it or to customize it

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,500
you've got no cycles available to

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,610
contribute and management doesn't know

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:12,170
what open-source software is so even so

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,820
I mean clearly they're useful cases for

24
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,219
operational tools to be built through

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,139
collaborative open source and preferably

26
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,020
collaborative open source with network

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,689
operators involved rather than just

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,670
randomly you know somebody's software

29
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,559
great software ideas and I'm a computer

30
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,159
scientist so I know about great software

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,479
ideas so be good if there was operator

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,700
involvement to ensure that CD

33
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,729
requirements are understood that it's

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,979
actually usable in the end and to rent

35
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,039
the wrong sort of expertise dominating

36
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:54,359
the technical work I was told I had to

37
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:57,710
put a cat picture in so yeah having a

38
00:01:54,359 --> 00:02:01,320
look at the kinds of things

39
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:03,780
yeah the kinds of things that are a

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,908
problem for network operators engaging

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,280
in development of open source software

42
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,580
and and ultimately the use of open

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,610
source software I'm putting together an

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,440
actual survey it will be a scientific

45
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,560
survey because I'm not a survey

46
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,690
scientist but it will be at least an

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,280
informal survey to collect data to

48
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,790
understand what kind of problems you

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,379
might

50
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,900
two halves all through open-source

51
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,420
software if there were the right fit and

52
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,049
then one of the requirements to four and

53
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,890
the impediments to actually

54
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:37,620
participating in the development of said

55
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,649
software contributing to the development

56
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,379
of it and were using it ultimately and

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,799
those are actually three very separate

58
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,659
points so what I'm doing today in a

59
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,909
lightning talk is just trying to raise

60
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,920
awareness that a survey is coming but

61
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,989
even better I'm looking for input on

62
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,238
what are the things I should be sure to

63
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:01,590
ask about so that your notion of why you

64
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,780
you know you would love to engage in it

65
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,220
if you could but what are your

66
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,019
impediments what are the things I should

67
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:13,109
ask what should i canvass and certainly

68
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:14,579
if you would be interested in in taking

69
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,489
the survey or engaging in this

70
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:19,829
discussion that would be great as I said

71
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,959
I am a computer scientist so a pointer

72
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,980
to somebody who's gonna be willing to

73
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,150
fill out the survey would be fine so if

74
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,379
your are the kinds of things that I've

75
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,030
already thought about in terms of

76
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:32,429
covering in the survey so you can see

77
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,409
how how far I have to go and how much

78
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,829
you can contribute to me shaping this up

79
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:40,280
to a more effective survey so in terms

80
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:42,780
of the scope of potential problem air

81
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,340
potato open-source software what are the

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,909
problem areas that should be addressed

83
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,370
in your view for open source software is

84
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,590
it you know reference implementation of

85
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,810
the network stack so that IOT doesn't

86
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,599
break the Internet is it reference

87
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,129
implementations of new standards because

88
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,040
that would be useful to actually see

89
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:04,228
that they work is it tooling for network

90
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,209
monitoring and management so that you

91
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,549
can you know break out of that hefty

92
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,709
subscription free every month or is it

93
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,189
something completely different is this

94
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:17,099
software that you think should exist you

95
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:20,250
know like the IOT stack is it that you

96
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:22,770
want to help create software open source

97
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,909
software are you looking for something

98
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,710
that would solve a you know

99
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:27,780
mission-critical operations critical

100
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,570
problem or something completely

101
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,619
different

102
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,150
what are the impediments to

103
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,750
participating in open source software

104
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,799
you have no coding resources in-house

105
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,740
maybe you have no intentions I

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,250
even if you do have coding resources you

107
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,720
have no what are your requirements maybe

108
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,010
one of your requirements is you would

109
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,110
like to have the option to participate

110
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,920
in the development of requirements and

111
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,360
the acceptance testing of OSS tools even

112
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,840
if you're not participating in the

113
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,570
coding itself again maybe there are

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,070
other things what are the limitations to

115
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,570
contributing maybe my employer already

116
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,610
supports one or more open-source

117
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,290
software development platforms what was

118
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,790
the question

119
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,920
or maybe you'd love to contribute

120
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:15,420
multiple million dollars to an

121
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,610
open-source platform maybe not or you

122
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,230
know what are the what are the what is

123
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,470
the landscape for contributing to open

124
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,990
source software in your environment in

125
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,300
terms of using open source software what

126
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,860
are the impediments you know is it you

127
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,720
just can't find the open source tools

128
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,560
that actually solve your problems so you

129
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,720
you resort to buying commercial software

130
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,550
you don't trust open source software and

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,300
you don't have the resources to inspect

132
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,220
it but you don't have the resources to

133
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,170
validate it figure it out and configure

134
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,740
it because you know open-source software

135
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:51,570
often comes with many many knobs and

136
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,760
what are your requirements for using

137
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,590
software for a lot of companies I know

138
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,820
the challenges you want to have

139
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:01,320
something you can pick up the phone and

140
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:04,050
call possibly 24/7 for setting it up

141
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,620
and/or debugging it in operation what

142
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:10,710
other requirements so today's ask as I

143
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,860
said really is I'm looking for input I'm

144
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,510
looking on the right in the right

145
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:19,200
questions to ask to gather information

146
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:21,840
and paint a picture of you know why our

147
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,180
network operators not engaging today in

148
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,640
the development and use of open source

149
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,640
software what are the things that could

150
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,469
be done to reduce that friction so that

151
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:37,320
we could actually you know have more

152
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:39,420
informed OSS developed and used and yeah

153
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,580
it just sort of as as outlined in the

154
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,080
previous slides it'd be useful to have

155
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,760
some input on you know what are some of

156
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,789
the possible answers and options in

157
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,770
those questions on that survey the

158
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,370
survey itself is

159
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:55,680
to run in the August September timeframe

160
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:58,199
I would like it to be August but I

161
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,699
recognize that August is is a holiday

162
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,590
month for many and then ultimately I

163
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,870
will be publishing the results of the

164
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,359
survey because whatever my interests are

165
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,770
I know that a lot of a lot of open

166
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,409
source platforms are struggling with

167
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,698
this very question and would find it

168
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:17,400
useful to know what you all are thinking

169
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,220
about these different aspects so again

170
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,429
looking for him but you can talk to me

171
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,889
now I'll be around in and out through

172
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:34,970
tomorrow and or you can drop me a note

173
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:34,970
at singing Capcom and that any answers

174
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:47,130
not but I have a cat fixation or

175
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:51,000
anything yeah Leslie one thing I found

176
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:54,300
is the Dockers are actually a really

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,790
great vehicle for bundling a bunch of

178
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,220
healthful open-source software into a

179
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,170
network's tools package that you can

180
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,620
simply download and run with one command

181
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,810
docker run and then have access to trace

182
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,340
routes and tea shark and all that stuff

183
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,230
and one of the things I found really

184
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,390
helpful is that you can install that on

185
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,480
your Mac your PC or up in the cloud and

186
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,740
the exact same tools the exact same

187
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,450
training is applicable regardless of

188
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,470
where that ends up being so that might

189
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,260
be one of the things you might want to

190
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:25,380
ask what would be the toolset Nanog

191
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,760
people believe should be within a docker

192
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,490
that specifically for network

193
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,659
diagnostics cool thanks and also points

194
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,270
to another aspect which is

195
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,010
awareness-raising and you know packaging

196
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:40,470
as well

197
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:43,700
great thank you any other thoughts if

198
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,700
not thank you very much

199
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,380
