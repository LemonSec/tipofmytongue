1
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,280
so what if this presentation is done

2
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,540
remotely

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,869
what if actually what you see on the

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:25,840
stage is not me in person it's a

5
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:31,240
hologram image of me it's the science

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:34,739
fiction probably not so what I'm

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,600
actually going to talk about is the

8
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,230
transport network requirements and

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,310
architecture for 5g so the intro I gave

10
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:50,739
you is kind of you know probably sooner

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:54,090
here than you can imagine saying that we

12
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,089
figure out how actually move on this

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:04,930
okay so to kind of start to build a

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:08,009
picture here I got started you know from

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,240
what we have today talking about 3G 4G

16
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:11,950
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,610
this one I just want to set the stage

18
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:18,010
here for for you know my next 30 minutes

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,979
so basically what I'm going to talk

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,500
about this is you know why

21
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:27,039
there are some key requirements for the

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,740
transport network in 5g and if we start

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,220
to look at you know the 4G today what

24
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,890
you actually have is a few data centers

25
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,260
so looking at this from an architectural

26
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,960
point of view you see a lot of hard web

27
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,689
so ignore you know the details on this

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,970
slide my main point on this slide is

29
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:50,939
that there's a lot of proprietary

30
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:54,670
hardware software in this now kind of

31
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:58,630
looking at the next phase so going from

32
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,790
you know a few data centers into the 5g

33
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,270
where you actually start to see that

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,890
there's a lot of micro data centers so

35
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,889
this goes actually pretty much back to

36
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,840
you know Mike's presentation from from H

37
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,609
micro yesterday saying that there's

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,030
going to be thousands of micro data

39
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,790
centers guess what this is actually the

40
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,930
reality with 5g and there's a reason for

41
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,489
these so recently being is that that you

42
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,430
know you go from a few

43
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:31,120
cloud-based huge data centers into

44
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,280
thousands of those now to start to build

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,220
be the picture up here a bit so why is

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,740
that well it's due to the fact that you

47
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,100
know I think it's easy to explain this

48
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,860
to you if we pick an example many of you

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,410
probably have heard of the you know

50
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,990
applications use cases for 5g so I'm

51
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,410
picking one of them enormous cars

52
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,910
self-driving cars I guess you know the

53
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,299
majority of you guys heard about those

54
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,090
ones right so to put this into some

55
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:05,290
context if you now compare that given

56
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,390
use case in a 4G environment what you

57
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,049
are going to see is that assume that you

58
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:14,109
actually have a car driving by itself in

59
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:17,530
a 40 environment the time it actually

60
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:20,290
takes to get the response back and then

61
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:24,690
assuming you have your few cloudy sees

62
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:27,429
is you know above 80 milliseconds that

63
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,510
would actually mean that you talk about

64
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,830
you know the car moving around four feet

65
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,709
during that period of time of getting

66
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,640
response back

67
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:41,110
okay so now if we compare that to the 5g

68
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,839
saying that you now actually have your

69
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,330
Micro data centers which basically means

70
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,430
that you know your radio base station is

71
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,790
truly close to your data center to your

72
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,740
micro data center the same example you

73
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,260
can see that you have less than five

74
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,800
milliseconds latency which basically

75
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:04,660
means that the car only moved like four

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:08,170
inches that amount of distance during

77
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:11,079
the response I get back so I guess you

78
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,380
know this does to explain to us or or

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,910
build up the picture for us saying that

80
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,519
fact being is a twist you need to have

81
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,579
some kind of a network in place here now

82
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,320
would it be a small fabric somewhere

83
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,359
would it be a huge fabric somewhere in

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,280
your data center it's still a core

85
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,550
network and the thing with 5g is that

86
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,450
it's cloud native which basically means

87
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,340
that all the services are virtualized so

88
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,330
you basically start

89
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,890
look at if you guys you know think of

90
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,070
the Rand Network today the radio access

91
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:50,969
network today as I mentioned it's a lot

92
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,430
of hardware software proprietary now it

93
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,860
kind of have DD or

94
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,590
from NFV you actually start to look at

95
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,810
you know all of these services and you

96
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,060
start to actually profile those being

97
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,180
why wouldn't we actually virtualized of

98
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,970
all of those ones putting those into the

99
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,400
cloud now question becomes would I have

100
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:15,180
it in a big data center in a micro data

101
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,919
center everything is virtualized so what

102
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,450
I'm trying to make a point on here is

103
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,570
that as 5gs cloud native you still need

104
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,000
to have a network in place as you can

105
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,610
see you might have a a you know network

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,590
fabric or you are going to have some

107
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,680
kind of a network fabric now question

108
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,900
becomes that okay in a huge data center

109
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,590
I probably have a you know three five

110
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,840
seven stage closed fabric while in a

111
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,570
micro datacenter I might have a a you

112
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,810
know small played to fabric for instance

113
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,000
so as we can see there's different

114
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,280
requirements based on on actually where

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,110
you are in the network and that kind of

116
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,599
goes back to what I was saying that it

117
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,520
depends on the different use cases you

118
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:06,060
have different applications you have it

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:08,760
file G so I kind of picked one of those

120
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,100
ones being you know the smart vehicle

121
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,670
obviously there's other applications as

122
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,280
well use cases I guess we don't even you

123
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,720
know we can't even imagine what use

124
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,390
cases you're going to start to see with

125
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,700
5g so there's a couple of ones mentioned

126
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,849
here you had a smart factory you have

127
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,630
IOT IOT is pretty interesting right

128
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:33,140
because as or there was a survey done

129
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,110
actually some time back saying that by

130
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,479
2024 that's like five years from now

131
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:42,990
you're going to have 16 billion IOT

132
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,060
device connected out of which a fourth

133
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,980
basically four billion is going to be

134
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,410
mobile connected the other ones is going

135
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,070
to be wired connected

136
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:55,160
and then you start to look at you know

137
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,560
the mobile and the the mobile and the

138
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,620
fixed broadband with five g's so there's

139
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:04,640
a lot of use cases applications that

140
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:07,070
goes with with you know 5g media is an

141
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,960
interesting one assume that you actually

142
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:13,510
want to have 4k or eight K

143
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,039
high-definition video on your handheld

144
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:19,159
that's going to put some demand on the

145
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,290
bandwidth right and and my point is that

146
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,730
you always basically go back to a

147
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:27,320
network somewhere it's all about

148
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:33,290
connectivity so to put it into some

149
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:36,140
context kind of again the comparing the

150
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,750
LTE and five gene so as you can see you

151
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,880
know this goes into the latency I think

152
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,350
I kind of made my point already with the

153
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,909
use case for the autonomous cars but

154
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,820
fact being is that you start to break up

155
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,950
the network into different parts with 5g

156
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,070
compared to you know the the previous

157
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:59,090
networks and as I mentioned you know my

158
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:02,330
example for 4k 8k video on your handheld

159
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,440
and this is you know on a per device so

160
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,340
basically you're going to see that

161
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,600
there's a huge increase in bandwidth and

162
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,419
obviously latest being another thing

163
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,870
here as well and then you start to look

164
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:18,110
at a thousand times increasing the

165
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,030
bandwidth per unit area which means that

166
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:24,950
you are starting to look at specific you

167
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:27,650
know antenna arrays all that stuff so

168
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,539
building up the the you know use cases

169
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,099
again and and obviously we have

170
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,380
mission-critical services being the

171
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,110
public safety for instance where you

172
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,260
today have your p 25 your tetra networks

173
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,960
and 5g would actually owe you to have

174
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,930
things like push-to-talk it would have

175
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,000
things like like you know sense or some

176
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,770
vehicles basically once you crash you

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,930
actually would sense and you know some

178
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,090
kind of alarm on that one so there's a

179
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,939
lot of interesting applications around

180
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,040
that one you have the the autonomous

181
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,199
driving as I mentioned and then you go

182
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,430
into massive IOT as I mentioned

183
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:06,439
you have your fixed and your mobile

184
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,019
broadband so this is just you know to

185
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:15,319
give you a few examples of obviously use

186
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:17,180
cases for for 5g now requirements I've

187
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:18,680
been kind of of mentioning these

188
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,709
requirements a couple of times already

189
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,839
but as we can see it's obvious you know

190
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:26,959
you need to have 100 100 percent

191
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,569
coverage you need to have you know low

192
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,089
latency on those and the huge increase

193
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:35,449
in the bandwidth demand with my example

194
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:40,759
on the media side and then you go into

195
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:43,790
and said you know the things like like a

196
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:46,579
long life lifestyle of batteries on the

197
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,589
IOT stuff so on so forth I'm going to

198
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:50,569
dig into all those details what

199
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,399
basically you know this slide shows is

200
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:54,500
always something I've been been

201
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,899
discussing already different

202
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,329
applications customer segments gave me

203
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:00,889
no business models so on so forth so you

204
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:02,479
guys have these as a reference these

205
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:06,529
flights I'm not going to spend that much

206
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,139
time on these slides now what I want to

207
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:13,790
spend some time on is actually the

208
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:16,339
service enablers so these two these two

209
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,689
actually squares I want to kind of spend

210
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,240
some more time on here

211
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:22,219
ignore the four other ones now it's it's

212
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,130
more on the radial side but you know the

213
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,699
highlighted ones is network slicing and

214
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:32,689
low latency networks so network slicing

215
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:36,410
is a pretty interesting one so as I gave

216
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:39,740
the example of self-driving cars we

217
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:43,730
understand that a use case having

218
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,829
specific requirements so if you look at

219
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,160
that when you basically have the auto

220
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:52,160
reliable low latency connection being

221
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,110
the example I gave you which basically

222
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,500
is going to be backhoe to micro

223
00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:00,040
datacenter and I kind of tried to build

224
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:04,850
up the picture for us to realize why

225
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:07,910
then you go into basically your your

226
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,370
mobile broadband you go into the Machine

227
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,139
type communication which might be back

228
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,689
hold all the way to the cloud datacenter

229
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,120
somewhere with different requirements

230
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:18,839
from

231
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:23,610
from that point of view so the

232
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:25,440
requirements kind of dictate how you're

233
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,730
going to connect those networks

234
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,820
licensing is by the 3gpp defined as you

235
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,980
know using the same network for multiple

236
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:39,540
applications with different requirements

237
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:41,880
so somebody could ask them ok so define

238
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:45,569
a network slice what is a network slice

239
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,480
a network slice is a connection of some

240
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,920
type basically it could be a VLAN it

241
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,570
could be a VX plan

242
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,120
you know tunnel it could be basically

243
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,880
anything the key thing is that how would

244
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,860
you fulfill the requirements from a

245
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,700
network point of view for these given

246
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,040
services so I said network slicing is

247
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,070
it's something that is kind of a key

248
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,650
thing within the 4G architectures now

249
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,270
low latency networks so as we can

250
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,250
understand you know going back to my

251
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,710
examples again the different

252
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,500
requirements are in regards to latency

253
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:22,200
as well which basically means that you

254
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,900
could ask yourself the question is is

255
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,120
you know TCP the optimal for that is TCP

256
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,699
optimization something you want to do or

257
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,370
is there some other product cause or

258
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,520
mechanism in place so there are some

259
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:38,550
discussions of something called the ICN

260
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,680
which is you know one way of thinking of

261
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:47,760
of transporting traffic in 5g

262
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:49,650
environments so the topology so I'm

263
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,900
trying to get to my point here with with

264
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:54,449
you know the network part truly putting

265
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,420
kind of explain during the network

266
00:12:54,450 --> 00:13:00,240
requirements so far T is all about soft

267
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,029
rotation of the network as I mentioned

268
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,290
it's cloud native which basically means

269
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:09,420
that looking at the RAM the radio access

270
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:11,730
network as I've been mentioning a couple

271
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,490
of times it's pretty much hardware

272
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,650
software centric today with proprietary

273
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,200
hardware and software so if that

274
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,980
actually moves into the seer and being

275
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,660
the cloud run or you know the

276
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,370
virtualization of the run functions

277
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,900
which means you basically have your

278
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,520
radio tower

279
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:34,920
then you basically move all of your

280
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:38,640
intelligence in your cloud into your

281
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,310
data center as virtualized nfe and Sdn

282
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,590
that's obvious you know a big part of

283
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:47,550
the architecture itself as we can

284
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:49,680
understand and obviously you start to

285
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,260
have a network somewhere that you know

286
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,510
is to transport for this one you go into

287
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,390
the Mac which has been been already kind

288
00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:00,120
of mentioned so make is the de mobile

289
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:03,350
edge cloud or is the multi access edge

290
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,780
so so truly you know did it cloud and

291
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:10,020
then you go into basically having your

292
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:12,240
control plane and your data plane split

293
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:17,490
up basically you know decoupling those

294
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,950
ones so the network slicing part this is

295
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,440
you know didi obviously from from the

296
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,170
network part what you have is your

297
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,080
castration layer where you have your ran

298
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,860
orchestration your coordinator

299
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,370
orchestration and your transport

300
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,720
orchestration then you go into the

301
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,940
different slices you have in the network

302
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,250
so you might have you know a specific

303
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,260
slice for specific enterprise you might

304
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:43,680
have multiple of those slices so and so

305
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:46,470
forth and then you go into all of your

306
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,670
virtualized services within the network

307
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:54,510
itself and then question becomes a case

308
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:57,959
so if we talk about you know a huge

309
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,760
amount of micro datacenters how am I

310
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,880
going to actually orchestrate and

311
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,580
automate all of this stuff so I have

312
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,620
different api's for that which basically

313
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,410
means that that you start to look at

314
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,150
api's for orchestrating all of these so

315
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,620
then you start to talk about something

316
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:18,689
called the song which is you know a

317
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:24,120
mechanism of actually orchestrating a

318
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:26,400
lot of stuff and automating all that you

319
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,290
have different slices as mentioned it's

320
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,360
you know based on the application you

321
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,959
have based on the application

322
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,300
requirements you have and I said you

323
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,190
have your API so you have basically a

324
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,300
way of interacting with those and

325
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:46,210
automate and orchestrate all of

326
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:52,180
stuff so the question becomes that 5j

327
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:53,980
transport is more than a cost so it's

328
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,530
truly an investment for critical

329
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,060
services as I kind of tried to explain

330
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,040
to you that that there's going to be a

331
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:03,489
lot of interesting use cases for this

332
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,339
and obviously it's an architecture as

333
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,230
well that will obviously underpin the

334
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,690
long term development of 5g commercial

335
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:15,340
office offerings as well as use cases

336
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:17,410
and it's part of the universal edge as I

337
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,440
mentioned you basically have your mobile

338
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,689
edge you have you know the packet the

339
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,670
optical coming together you have USDA

340
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,820
and you have your creation layer your

341
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:33,010
your different API so on so forth

342
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:35,380
automation so this gives you an

343
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,810
understanding of the you know 5g

344
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,210
transport platforms I think this

345
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,829
actually example express it better to

346
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,890
you so I'm going to skip the previous

347
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:48,820
slide but what this shows you is you

348
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:50,470
know the network architecture itself so

349
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,520
a couple of key points I want to make

350
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:57,820
here is looking at the for the

351
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,970
centralized strand model obviously as I

352
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,680
kind of started my presentation saying

353
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:06,010
everything is around a few big data

354
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,959
centers while with 5g you go into a

355
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,629
distributed model with a lot of small

356
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,680
micro data centers which basically mean

357
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:16,630
that you go in a 5g you know

358
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,730
architecture you have your your argue

359
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:22,030
which is your radio unit you have your D

360
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:25,030
you which is your digital unit you're

361
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,639
going to see you the customer unit now

362
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:30,430
the customer unit is actually needing a

363
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,560
switch right it's probably going to be

364
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,870
related to switch so going back to my

365
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:40,510
example of your fabrics this might be a

366
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:42,129
small fabric in your H Network and then

367
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,430
you go into the back hole which is your

368
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:49,210
you're busy or your your packet core so

369
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:52,240
looking at the obviously requirements

370
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,460
from a late as a point of view now

371
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,309
some key things I want to point out here

372
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,249
if you look at the left hand side what

373
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:04,928
you see is actually the synchronization

374
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:09,730
so 4g actually uses gps while 5g is

375
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:11,440
going to use PTP and sinky PTP zoom keys

376
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,159
so that's pretty interesting due to the

377
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:19,480
fact that you know you need to provide

378
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:22,570
synchronization to your network so what

379
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,299
is you know the the DSN or as I

380
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,129
mentioned PDP is a time-sensitive

381
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:31,389
networking service that's part of the

382
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:35,009
802 that 1q standard it's the P part

383
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:42,369
it's sorry the PDP part so it's

384
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:44,649
discussed us as 1588 v2 so basically PT

385
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:45,970
piece starting to get more and more

386
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:48,580
traction in multiple different

387
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,580
industries as you can see like like

388
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,869
aerospace automotive media which is

389
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,689
pretty interesting that you actually go

390
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:57,639
into PT p what you need sync so there's

391
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,179
a bunch of applications and use cases

392
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:04,418
for that and hence is pretty interesting

393
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:08,850
to actually see that that's a common

394
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:11,830
kind of sync mechanism for the DX whole

395
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:15,519
networks being the the backhoe mead-hall

396
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:18,939
and front hole networks so with that

397
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,499
said obviously PSN I'm going to skip

398
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,269
over this slide is for your reference

399
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:24,279
the only thing I want to point out on

400
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:26,679
this slide is the you know if you look

401
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,720
at the resource management basically

402
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,629
says that you using something like the

403
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,629
yang data models and this goes back to

404
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:36,879
my example of you know the huge amount

405
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:39,100
of micro data centers you're going to

406
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:41,730
have in the 5g environment which

407
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,769
basically means that you need to have a

408
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:51,970
truly scalable way of orchestrating and

409
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:54,309
automating things so this is basically

410
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,909
just to recap saying that you know 5g

411
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:59,980
model is DDT 5g is model driven

412
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:03,249
automation I kind of mentioned that

413
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,670
already so it's truly due to the fact

414
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:08,059
that you have you

415
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:11,210
the edge cloud with a lot of microwave

416
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,920
data centers that you need to

417
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,100
orchestrate and automate or that stuff

418
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,200
and part of obviously you know the

419
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:21,260
automation is is based on that come from

420
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,870
young models going away from the the you

421
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:31,760
know CLI based and more moving into the

422
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:33,409
APA api-based so what I like on this

423
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,049
slide I'm not going to go through this

424
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:39,710
in details but I you know want to point

425
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:41,629
out the the red square you have which

426
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,850
page it says that with the full mesh

427
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,250
packet network architecture cross domain

428
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,980
control will allow operators to support

429
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,410
into end services with the appropriate

430
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,890
resources allocated in the radio core

431
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:56,929
and transport cross domain automation

432
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,290
which basically means that you're going

433
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:05,419
to automate all the different factors

434
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:08,418
within the network PTP

435
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:09,980
this is not a deep time PTP so basically

436
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:13,490
PTP what it's all about

437
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:16,280
is a way of providing sync what you have

438
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,380
is some kind of a clock here where you

439
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,629
might have you know a peer-to-peer enter

440
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,850
and clock hierarchy where you have a

441
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:26,059
grandmaster clock and then you basically

442
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:28,250
are going to synchronize your clocks in

443
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:32,480
the devices based on this grand master

444
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:34,309
clock so this kind of just shows you and

445
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,730
high-level overview of that one this is

446
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:40,399
a more in-depth slide for your reference

447
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,230
showing how you would correct you know

448
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,450
your time once you pass through your

449
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,880
network different or different elements

450
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:50,030
within your network so there's multiple

451
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,580
ways of doing this as said is just just

452
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:58,299
a high-level picture of PTP how it's

453
00:21:52,580 --> 00:22:05,230
it's done this is basically a a you know

454
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:07,879
blueprint for the the 3gpp for 5g and

455
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:11,840
basically what I've been covering you

456
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,179
know truly as a quick flight through is

457
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,110
some of the requirement for the

458
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,970
transport network within 5g

459
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,560
and what you can see is obviously you

460
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,080
have a separation of the control planner

461
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,919
data play what I'd like to point out is

462
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,860
that as 5g is basically going to

463
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,500
virtualize all the services you still

464
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,760
need to have a transport network in

465
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,680
place you still need to provide

466
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,900
connectivity on that one

467
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:43,380
as we saw it's basically you know a huge

468
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:46,150
increase in bandwidth requirements and

469
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,980
obviously you go into different latency

470
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,320
things how you would cope with those

471
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:55,000
ones based on different synchronization

472
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,980
mechanisms so on so forth so I think I

473
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,030
have four minutes to go this basically

474
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,770
concludes my presentation and I'm going

475
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,840
to be around here so if you guys want to

476
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,240
have a discussion feel free to come on

477
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,510
and fetch me and you know have a

478
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:14,380
discussion on this one obviously you

479
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:16,570
know this is a pretty hot topic if or a

480
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,810
pretty hot topic to cover in 30 minutes

481
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:22,899
so I said this was a truly high-flying

482
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:34,050
kind of work to on this one all right

483
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:34,050
thank you witches

484
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,010
yep thanks Dan McGraw and John Hopkins

485
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:44,740
APL just drilling down a little bit into

486
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:47,860
your centralized versus distributed data

487
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,750
centers right now you know under 4G LTE

488
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:59,050
there's e node bees all over the place

489
00:23:49,750 --> 00:24:00,820
right they're not centralized so you no

490
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,310
way you've got to break up right now

491
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,470
into centralized versus distributed I

492
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:07,389
mean you know I get the point that

493
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:10,000
you're making with the latency tax but

494
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,650
right now you've got a distributed model

495
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,370
where some parts are all over the place

496
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:17,290
in some parts of centralized so that

497
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,120
brings me to the question of like okay

498
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,850
so what's all that different right now

499
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,780
you know you can't the ratch can't take

500
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,709
all that long right so it's you know I'm

501
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,910
trying to figure out what the

502
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,160
differences are actually gonna be

503
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:34,660
because right now it's already sort of

504
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,490
the way you're describing yeah I didn't

505
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,730
really catch the question you had this

506
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:41,800
so the question was around ad

507
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:44,140
centralized versus DD distributed it's

508
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,840
already partially distributed and

509
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,090
partially centralized yeah you know the

510
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,649
subscriber database is centralized

511
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,230
because that doesn't take very long I

512
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:57,010
mean that doesn't happen very often

513
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:59,350
right but the parts that you know the e

514
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,920
node bees are already all over the place

515
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:04,899
right great yeah so you've already got a

516
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:08,200
model where some parts are all over the

517
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,540
place in 4G LTE some parts are all over

518
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,940
the place and some parts are centralized

519
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:16,060
so it just seems like it's gonna drive G

520
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,980
is gonna be a continuation of that yeah

521
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,270
I agree but I mean then you go back to

522
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,680
the basic what I was trying to make a

523
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,540
point on it is depending on the

524
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,000
application and your network slicing you

525
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,860
know which applications are kind of the

526
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,720
man is specific or having specific

527
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,840
requirements from your network point of

528
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,600
view and those might then actually use

529
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,909
the DD Micro data centers which you then

530
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,340
have as close to the tower as possible

531
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,230
compared to the other services that you

532
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,939
then might have you know the backhaul

533
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,150
all the way to your cloud data center

534
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:48,580
somewhere so I think it's you know if if

535
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,120
you don't look kind of only on the radio

536
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,679
part

537
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,689
if you start to look at you know more

538
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,760
from from the application point of view

539
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,800
I said everything is going to be cloud

540
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,120
native which means that all of the

541
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,460
services are going to reside in the

542
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,320
cloud they might be distributed they

543
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,400
might be low color they won't be you

544
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,740
know somewhere as a basically

545
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,780
application running in your cloud right

546
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,690
it's just that when you distribute stuff

547
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,309
all over the place that's very expensive

548
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,020
so they're not gonna do that

549
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:19,180
except for things where they absolutely

550
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,980
have to the parts that really really

551
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:26,950
really have to be out there on the close

552
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:29,320
side right I agree yeah thank you any

553
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,179
more questions yeah Tony Talbert

554
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,909
comcast's I was kind of wondering with

555
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:34,900
the network slicing I mean I agree with

556
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,929
all the things that the previous

557
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,530
questioner asked about but how where's

558
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:43,840
the contention domain arbitrate it so

559
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:46,960
like if you have the network's slicing

560
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,428
that happens in the D you or see you

561
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,860
area like the radio is all shared right

562
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:57,160
I mean do you imagine different

563
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:00,010
terminals dedicated to different slices

564
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,929
or applications or does that go correct

565
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,420
but I mean if you go back to my slide

566
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:06,480
basically saying that you have different

567
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,559
slices for different applications

568
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,110
application might actually be a mobile

569
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,990
broadband it might be fixed broadband so

570
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:15,459
it depends on actually what you have

571
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,980
saying that you know it doesn't really

572
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,530
need to be everything mobile it could be

573
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,540
you know a fixed service as well I think

574
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:25,059
the point I'm trying to make here is

575
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,850
that that you know you have a single

576
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:29,860
infrastructure in place but you need to

577
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,230
share that infrastructure based on the

578
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,090
use cases and applications and then you

579
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,950
go into the fact that you have different

580
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,870
requirements for the applications I

581
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,120
assume you have a a you know

582
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:43,178
self-driving car competing with me using

583
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,979
you know 4k video on my handheld that's

584
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:47,620
where the network slicing with with you

585
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,530
know how you're going to do it is an

586
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,290
interesting question so to say okay

587
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:57,110
thanks thanks

588
00:27:53,290 --> 00:28:00,100
any more questions okay thank you

589
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,100
Michael thank you

590
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,119
[Applause]

591
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,060
you
