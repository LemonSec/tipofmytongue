1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:19,680
good afternoon my name is Craig labovitz

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,420
I'm a CTO of Nokia deep field now I went

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,670
to the first 50 NIA Noggs

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,329
sort of all of them consecutively then

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,300
took a break a lot of new faces haven't

6
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:33,960
been to Aniyah noggin last 5 or 7 years

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,540
but thank you for having me back so

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,579
about 10 years ago I was up here well

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,950
not literally here but I was at another

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,250
nanog and I gave a talk about what

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,740
Internet traffic looked like in addition

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,750
to my role at Nokia I'm also a guy who

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,330
likes to write a paper about every 10

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,430
years less you know 30 years about how

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,980
the internet is evolving how it's

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,900
changing so this is the third or fourth

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,550
installment so when we are measuring the

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,709
Internet and a lot of the talk today is

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,060
really about data from providers around

20
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:12,479
the world we're collecting SNMP BGP more

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,720
recently GRP see more recently dns

22
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,230
recursive responses from very large

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,970
carriers across the US and Europe I will

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,630
say that this is very much a preliminary

25
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,150
talk ten years ago it took us six months

26
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,670
or so of processing and normalizing the

27
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,130
data anyone who does analytics knows

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,870
that data is noisy requires an awful lot

29
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,600
of cleaning to make sure you're not

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,490
dealing with artifacts so while I'm not

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,729
going to stand by all the exact numbers

32
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,880
today directionally the observations on

33
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,260
the upcoming slides are indeed accurate

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,298
we're also working through with

35
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,540
providers both in the US and North

36
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,430
America as well as in Europe on what

37
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,340
data we can use and working through the

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,400
agreement and permissions we do have a

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,560
pretty big view into u.s. traffic give

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,590
or take number of eyeballs about 75

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,260
percent us eyeballs were somehow engaged

42
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,140
with working on QE and traffic

43
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,790
engineering so again this talk is pretty

44
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:15,329
similar to at least some of the

45
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:18,780
observations back in 2009 but the data

46
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,209
again needs to be cleaned so I'll show a

47
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,910
number of data points as I go through

48
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,370
the observations

49
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,100
one of the observations of course is not

50
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,290
particular they're particularly relevant

51
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,510
Tori the internet is getting bigger and

52
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,030
is gaining bigger rather quickly by

53
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,910
traffic volume depending what you count

54
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,820
40 to 50 percent sort of annualized

55
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,010
year-over-year and this is across the

56
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:47,019
board across the world though of course

57
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:50,390
there are regional and provider variants

58
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:53,330
the other thing that's happening as the

59
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:58,130
internet traffic volume grows the number

60
00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:01,040
of sources the number of unique ASN the

61
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,890
number of BGP prefixes the number of

62
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,679
hosting and cloud providers is shrinking

63
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,070
almost as rapidly and I'll show some

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,630
data on that as well one of the main

65
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,549
things of course this is happening is

66
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,940
that the Internet has completed the

67
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,040
migration give or take to CDN and I'll

68
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,800
go through the rest of the bullet points

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,709
coming up all this is important of

70
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,920
course because the changing internet

71
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:30,230
traffic flows demands are all having a

72
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,709
significant impact on how we think about

73
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:36,799
engineering the network doing Keowee and

74
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:42,170
of course doing things like security and

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,970
DDoS so to jump into the data first you

76
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,859
know asking the question how big is the

77
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,980
internet is somewhat of a fool's game

78
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,860
now back 10 years ago we look primarily

79
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,369
at intradomain traffic that is traffic

80
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,800
across need to be peering links today of

81
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,590
course huge volumes of traffic are not

82
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,590
inter-domain they're coming from on net

83
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,170
CDN or direct peering or the provider

84
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,970
video on demand you know what do you

85
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,670
count when you count in it Internet

86
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,030
traffic we're seeing cable providers

87
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,488
move qualms to Internet and basically

88
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,070
all us providers are in the midst or

89
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:22,789
have an immediate plan to move linear

90
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,580
video to IP so you know what you count

91
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,440
becomes sort of an interesting question

92
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,690
but give or take when I was last up in

93
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,150
front of me inaud we guessed the

94
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,700
internet was about you know 40 Turbots

95
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,469
per second sort of at peak today were

96
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,810
north of 800

97
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,750
go may disagree with us buy you know a

98
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,640
couple hundred Turbots but generally you

99
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,680
know I think the trend is there and

100
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,990
there's more details by the way on how

101
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,060
we calculate this if anyone really wants

102
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,910
to wade through a paper from ten years

103
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:57,610
ago there's some excruciating level of

104
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,610
detail on the math and the statistics

105
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,219
and you know it's just kind of curious

106
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:08,060
to look at providers we looked at in

107
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:10,870
1997 except me in 2009 and to see what

108
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:15,050
their traffic pattern looked like in

109
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:18,080
2019 the first observation was out of

110
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,600
the 150 we tried to compare it's really

111
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,109
hard to compare the number of companies

112
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,120
that hadn't merged been acquired

113
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:29,060
radically changed their business model

114
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,330
between 2009 or otherwise consolidated

115
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,740
was relatively small but again if you

116
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,510
look at some of the providers we're

117
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,450
seeing you know range of different

118
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,060
growth so the biggest growth being with

119
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:45,950
again the content providers and the

120
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,450
consumer but this is one of my there's

121
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,520
really two slides in this deck they

122
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:53,150
think are really interesting this is one

123
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,960
of them when I started my career CDN

124
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:59,630
were a nice to have in the network

125
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,210
people deployed Akamai caches to offload

126
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:06,190
their expensive transit maybe you could

127
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:09,099
offload 10 20 percent of your traffic

128
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:12,710
through the years the volume of traffic

129
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:16,430
migrating from Enterprise hosted to CDN

130
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:19,909
has increased year by year by the time

131
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:24,260
you get to 2018 as we look at data

132
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:27,500
across us providers on average CDN has

133
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:31,039
grown to now north of 90 percent of

134
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:35,060
traffic is broadly defined coming or

135
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:38,870
going from CDN in by the way in this

136
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:42,550
definition of CDN we include Netflix and

137
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:44,570
we include dedicated vendor CDN in

138
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,740
addition to sort of the the public

139
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,310
Akamai's fast lee's of the world

140
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:54,420
so by the time you get to tooth

141
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,940
nineteen CDN is not an adjunct to the

142
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:00,210
network this pretty much is the network

143
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:04,260
and we've seen traffic engineering shift

144
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:07,260
from worrying about peers and ASN and

145
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,560
a/s paths to really be in question of

146
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,480
how do you interrelate with a CDN

147
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,020
because it is such a large portion of

148
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:19,680
the network traffic largely driven by

149
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,719
video the other thing that's happened in

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,870
this time frame is I'm looking at my

151
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,580
colleague from the NSFNET days down here

152
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,100
when we used to do the NSFNET we do

153
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,430
traffic engineering once a month we had

154
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,950
really nice like old telephony you know

155
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,190
sort of traffic growth and once a month

156
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:42,300
meetings were fine by the time to get to

157
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:45,150
2019 not only is most of the traffic cbn

158
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,130
but it's adaptive bitrate meaning the

159
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:51,419
traffic will swing and grow and try to

160
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:53,310
use all the capacity of the link which

161
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,010
of course makes things like looking at

162
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,280
S&P octets and other standard management

163
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:01,560
tools a little hard to understand if you

164
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,090
have a capacity issue because if you

165
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,760
appear with Google the Hitmen they'll

166
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:08,460
they'll they'll use that link and as the

167
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,320
rightly should so really significant

168
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,570
issues for how we look at doing traffic

169
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,520
engineering I should also note the

170
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,640
definition of CDN is pretty blurry you

171
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,080
know is us three a CDN do you count all

172
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,770
the providers that are doing edge

173
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,830
compute but if you look at actually the

174
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:28,740
breakdown by traffic volume certainly at

175
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,200
peak and we look at p95 we're seeing

176
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,440
folks like open connects and YouTube

177
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,460
really now you know third excuse me

178
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,630
vendor specific application specific CDN

179
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,450
really being some of the largest

180
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,550
portions you know ten years ago

181
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,340
primarily it was all Akamai we're now

182
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,770
seeing the Akamai traffic now much more

183
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:53,040
distributed over folks like level three

184
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:56,910
CDN fastly and other newer entrants in

185
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:01,939
the market so far more diverse CDN

186
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:04,110
market that there was back in even 2009

187
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,490
and I should mention to you

188
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,970
when you look at this this is looking at

189
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:11,459
p95 traffic volume across a range of us

190
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,339
providers you know not all traffic is

191
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:17,579
the same monetary value it's often hard

192
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:20,670
to infer business value just looking at

193
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:24,899
the traffic volumes but this is a quick

194
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:27,240
breakdown this is my second favorite

195
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,910
slide in the deck or the one I find most

196
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,040
interesting for years we've been

197
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,459
watching the growth of the beach V

198
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,670
prefixes it was thirty thousand then a

199
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:40,410
hundred thousand two hundred thousand

200
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:44,130
you know we're now north give or take of

201
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:46,740
what you're counting 800,000 and the

202
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,720
default free tables that's huge

203
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,339
I never thought it would get this big I

204
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,709
never thought you all would be so good

205
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:57,950
at disaggregating I'm only happy and now

206
00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:04,199
a v6 to work with I can't wait to see

207
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:05,970
what happens so huge BGP table you know

208
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,279
the overall traffic volume is growing

209
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,160
the BGP table has grown but if you

210
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,029
actually look across 35 or 40 providers

211
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,839
look at the prefix look at the traffic

212
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:21,899
for BGP route you'll find that for those

213
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,779
800,000 the vast vast majority are

214
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,810
getting very tiny amounts of traffic in

215
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:30,300
fact you know many of your customers

216
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:35,369
would never notice if you drop the

217
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:38,339
bottom 780,000 most of the traffic hits

218
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:41,940
going into a thousand or even 500 BGP

219
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:45,089
prefixes again all trends we've seen for

220
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,350
a while ten years ago we are really

221
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,899
seeing the real beginning of

222
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,959
consolidation traffic moving to CDN

223
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,750
traffic moving to ec2 and other cloud

224
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,399
providers where we are now is kind of

225
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,300
the end of that decade log

226
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:03,120
transformation of Internet traffic and

227
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,459
Internet consolidation and of course

228
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,149
there's some really interesting I think

229
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:12,660
things come out of this observation you

230
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:14,779
know if you're worried about DDoS if you

231
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,640
are worried about traffic engineering

232
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:24,140
the focus is probably not

233
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:26,430
the 750,000 it's probably this 1000 if

234
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,960
you're worried about floods of traffic

235
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,420
and DDoS coming from all over the

236
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,930
internet and aren't sure what to block

237
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:36,449
well you don't need 800,000 Akal entries

238
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,660
you can do a lot more with flowspec net

239
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:42,210
conf with a focus on you know a thousand

240
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,459
of them so really interesting

241
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:47,400
implications for how we think about

242
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:51,810
security and how we think about traffic

243
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:54,439
engineering and as I said you know it's

244
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:57,239
been a pretty interesting consolidation

245
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,120
you know back when I started my career

246
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,590
we everyone had their own website you

247
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,420
know there were thousands of different

248
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:08,880
video applications I watch flash video

249
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,250
but over time we've seen an incredible

250
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,160
pace of consolidation for the

251
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,980
applications now the applications vary

252
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,130
if you look in Asia there's basically

253
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,330
ten that dominate all them are slightly

254
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,360
different I don't think there's any

255
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:27,810
overlap and there's ten that are

256
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,050
basically get you do 70% 80% of traffic

257
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:35,579
in the US with of course Netflix during

258
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:38,160
prime time being the peak followed by by

259
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,620
YouTube streaming Amazon but again

260
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,890
really tremendous consolidation in the

261
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,680
market for what the average consumer

262
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:51,030
goes to what the average consumer views

263
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:55,589
on any given day and of course the

264
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,880
Chinese market looks quite different one

265
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:01,800
of the things I thought would take much

266
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:04,830
longer to happen is TLS you know back

267
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,079
when I gave my last man out talk ten

268
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,930
years ago you know this was just a

269
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,840
fraction of a percent of Internet

270
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:16,760
traffic including by the way quick SSL

271
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:21,390
you know other other sorts of end-to-end

272
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:26,760
encryption of HTTPS and so on but really

273
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:29,670
post Snowden and as we get to 2018 for

274
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,670
the first time we've seen TLS actually

275
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,860
not be a fraction

276
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,740
but at least broadly measured across us

277
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,470
providers it is now the finally the

278
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,500
majority of traffic and we're seeing

279
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,480
that trend slowly continue though it is

280
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,920
interesting watching Netflix and other

281
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,130
video providers who are clearly

282
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,640
experimenting sort of evaluating since

283
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:57,570
there is you know there is nonzero cost

284
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:59,760
associated with its migration to TLS but

285
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,150
again it's pretty interesting to see for

286
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,020
the first time at least as we measure it

287
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:07,770
2018 is a year

288
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:10,140
TLS became the majority this also has

289
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:12,110
some interesting implications for the

290
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,920
way providers do measurement

291
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,470
particularly in mobile networks

292
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,040
providers have typically relied on dpi

293
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:23,880
to do both policing congestion control

294
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:26,939
as well as analytics when the majority

295
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,800
of your traffic is now TLS that of

296
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,930
course make some of these payload

297
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:38,069
inspection techniques much more

298
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:41,040
challenging in 2019 now I was really

299
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:45,030
fascinated this morning watching some of

300
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,010
the discussion around v6 and I should

301
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,709
add by the way about seven years ago or

302
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:54,420
maybe ten years twelve years ago I wrote

303
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:56,120
a blog lamenting the failure of v6 you

304
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,699
know back when I wrote this probably in

305
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,490
2007 we had been chasing v6 for more

306
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:07,140
than a decade and it was still like 2%

307
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:10,160
or 1% of traffic and this was again pre

308
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:14,550
air and exhaustion pre ripe exhaustion

309
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,010
but back in 2007 the only thing to

310
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:20,339
attract you to v6 was maybe seeing a

311
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:23,400
dancing turtle or yeah see some people

312
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:26,700
remember but there wasn't a lot of

313
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:30,810
drivers so it really has been I think I

314
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:32,100
was wrong it took ipv4 exhaustion and I

315
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:37,500
forget what the number was this morning

316
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:40,500
you know in dollars per IP 50 and by the

317
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:44,680
way we used to control 35 / 8 so bill

318
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:50,920
and I are lamenting that we did that

319
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:54,640
that would have been a lot now now I

320
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:57,160
know but you know we were lamenting that

321
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,710
there is you know very little I P v6

322
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,420
that really took the exhaustion in for

323
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:05,920
ipv4 to ipv6 to be monetized so you know

324
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,870
if you actually look at Google numbers

325
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,520
and others we're seeing somewhere around

326
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:15,970
30 percent of IP requests to Google

327
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,800
being v6 traffic and indeed over the

328
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,339
last year and a half two years we've

329
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,949
seen you know v6 traffic again across us

330
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:27,490
providers grow from a relatively small

331
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:30,790
percentage to really 15 to 20 percent of

332
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,700
traffic is now ipv6 certainly

333
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:36,939
inter-domain the one thing I find

334
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:40,360
interesting though is it stopped we saw

335
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,230
a nice ramp up for v6 and then really

336
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:47,020
over the last year as a percentage of v4

337
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:50,020
it stopped aiming and I wasn't really

338
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,650
sure why that was I think this talk this

339
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:55,000
morning provided some possible insight

340
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:59,500
but at least is a percentage growth

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,240
we've seen mostly flat on v6 and again

342
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,400
you know if you look at where the v6 is

343
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,970
coming from like everything else in the

344
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,069
Internet

345
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,490
it's a relatively small number of

346
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:13,869
providers are generating the majority of

347
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:17,130
v6 LED really by YouTube Netflix you

348
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:20,169
know Apple iTunes Facebook and others

349
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,910
and it's clear that this continues you

350
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,520
know continues to be some

351
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:28,209
experimentation both with TLS and

352
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,980
providers moving content to v6 that I

353
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:35,620
think certainly warrants further study

354
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:39,100
and discussion now so far we've been

355
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:41,709
focused on talking about traffic we also

356
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,919
have large volumes of recursive DNS

357
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:47,110
probably one of the largest collections

358
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,080
where as part of our monitoring in

359
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,178
conjunction with providers in the US and

360
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,389
around the world we collect recursive

361
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,940
DNS responses actually using another

362
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,510
talk maybe I know 10 years ago again

363
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,080
five year

364
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,940
years ago about DNS flow so it's kind of

365
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,030
curious not just to look at traffic

366
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,000
volume but what happens if I spend a day

367
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:15,280
and look at a couple billion DNS

368
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,840
responses how many IDs is that you know

369
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,070
how big is the internet how many if you

370
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:25,959
query yeah you know a enyo 70 million

371
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:29,080
users billion DNS requests how many

372
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:33,010
different IPS do you get well it turns

373
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,909
out you get about three million and then

374
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,140
you really kind of hit a very long tail

375
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,840
so we like to talk about how big the

376
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,490
Internet is how many millions of IPs are

377
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,669
billions with ipv6

378
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:48,670
but Lee's from DNS perspective you're

379
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,880
about three million four you know the

380
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:55,450
longtail I should say the actual domains

381
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,880
which is in red continues to grow with

382
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,580
us primarily because backup providers

383
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,780
and a whole host of people encode things

384
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,730
in the fqdn as they query so you'll see

385
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,410
and it's also by the way things like

386
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,260
subdomain randomized subdomain and

387
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:15,040
you'll see like DDoS and lots of other

388
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:18,040
stuff as bad as they thought BGP was DNS

389
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:23,350
is even more noisy and you know

390
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:25,690
interesting as you look at the data so

391
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,879
as I said I think as we reflect on

392
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,130
what's happening we are seeing some

393
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,190
challenges as we look at traffic

394
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,150
engineering quality of experience

395
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:38,890
certainly we're seeing things like

396
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:41,440
California GDR PE and others impact what

397
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,930
types of data providers can get from the

398
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,710
network we're seeing encryption have a

399
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,980
similar effect

400
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:51,520
I spent by the way the previous 15 years

401
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,140
or whatever doing DDoS so it's also in

402
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,600
the next section I'll talk a little bit

403
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,480
about how we see the DDoS market

404
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,929
changing and this both I think good news

405
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,930
and bad news

406
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:08,020
so you know first the bad news DDoS

407
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,030
attacks are growing for a while by the

408
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,160
way DDoS kind of flattened out when you

409
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,049
get to about 2011

410
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,360
everyone who's going to buy our bure had

411
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:18,639
bought our bure you kind of had a sort

412
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,949
of flattening of sort of than if you do

413
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,010
Google search for news articles you know

414
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:27,760
there's kind of a status quo had been

415
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:31,210
arranged starting sometime after 2011

416
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,210
the status quo began to be upset and we

417
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:36,789
really had a couple things driving that

418
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,620
number one was Giggy to the home you

419
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:40,690
know if you have infected subscribers

420
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,840
and their 10 Meg you know what are they

421
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:45,610
going to do when you have ten hundred

422
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,678
gig you know one gig connected

423
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:50,590
subscribers it quickly becomes a

424
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,390
different story we've also seen of

425
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,299
course a rapid growth if you look at MAC

426
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:59,470
addresses releases DHCP leases in the

427
00:20:55,299 --> 00:21:02,168
home we've gone from one or two you know

428
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,179
about five six years ago to now you know

429
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:09,190
folks are quoting averages of twenty or

430
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:12,730
thirty so huge explosion of IOT when we

431
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:15,340
did our first DDoS company now 15 years

432
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,980
ago eighteen years ago most of the

433
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,559
attacks were either reflector or they

434
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,840
were spoofed people sending just replay

435
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,020
of sin you know sin attacks and others

436
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,879
just as fast as they could and spoofing

437
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,710
was pretty easy you could use a small

438
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,559
number of machines hide your source

439
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:35,440
spoof large volumes of synthetic

440
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:40,149
replayed traffic by the time we get to

441
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,010
2019 BC p-38 your PF very little of the

442
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,990
attack traffic we're seeing or small

443
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,179
much smaller fraction maybe five percent

444
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:50,020
under 10% is spoofed

445
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:52,210
and the vast majority is real stack you

446
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:55,200
know things sending IOT devices and

447
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,929
others or reflectors sending the traffic

448
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,169
though well the DDoS attacks have grown

449
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:05,169
I think one of the interesting things is

450
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:07,750
to see when we look at reflectors when

451
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:11,380
we look at you know open ntp monoliths

452
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,090
how many advices is that so one of the

453
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,970
other data sources we've been doing is

454
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:18,580
we've been crawling the internet for

455
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:21,100
every attack we see we're crawling every

456
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,199
IP involved in the attack and we're

457
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,610
tracking how many web cameras how many

458
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,440
DNS resolvers and so

459
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:33,699
and it turns out while the Internet is

460
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,770
big it's not that big in fact you know

461
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,950
it is pretty straightforward to

462
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:43,060
enumerate all of the stratum 1 ntp

463
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:45,490
stratum 2 all of the Public DNS it's

464
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,909
pretty easy to enumerate all of the open

465
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,170
DNS resolvers involved in attack on

466
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:53,830
average we're seeing between you know 8

467
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:56,890
and 10,000 resolvers all of which

468
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:59,500
handily fit into a nice flow spec or key

469
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:03,490
kam where you can block the attack if

470
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:06,370
you have that list so while the attacks

471
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,470
are growing it's become a lot more

472
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,959
straightforward as the Internet has

473
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:13,960
consolidated to understand what you need

474
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,050
to whitelist and what you can block

475
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,490
it's also been I think very powerful as

476
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:22,290
net conf gaying

477
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:24,640
G RPC the silicon both merchants silicon

478
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:27,940
you know Nokia has our own silica and

479
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,830
all sort of getting better when we

480
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,410
started my last DDoS company you know

481
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,330
you were it was crazy to think about

482
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,750
installing Ackles on your router of the

483
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,179
day it was both you know

484
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:43,450
capacity it was management it was

485
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,490
stability today flowspec and others have

486
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,040
gone from being something only a few

487
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,570
providers have done to as I as I have

488
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,379
these conversations fairly widely

489
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:55,179
deployed and you know this is just an

490
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,830
example it's pretty amazing when you

491
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,920
look at some of these attacks this is a

492
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,810
PlayStation consumer under attack these

493
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,540
are all real IPs

494
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:06,879
coming from a variety of the titles

495
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:10,090
wrong this should actually be an GP but

496
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,320
this is an MTP mana list from range of

497
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:15,520
sources all attacking a PlayStation user

498
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,770
one of the nice things by the way is

499
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,700
back when we started a DDoS company now

500
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,800
15 years ago

501
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,440
gamers attacking gamers we're the

502
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,330
biggest source of DDoS at least one

503
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,550
thing still holds true today with that I

504
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:36,189
think I've left just about five minutes

505
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:38,550
for questions and it's quiet

506
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,780
someone must have a question

507
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:44,800
just to make me feel better doesn't

508
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,490
someone have a question just to make you

509
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,090
feel better

510
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:53,290
I'm ed from CenturyLink so you talked

511
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:56,949
about TLS so how does your DDoS fit with

512
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:59,860
TLS since its you know everything is

513
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:02,710
hidden go back to your slide number 15

514
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:06,520
you know a lot of those attacks you

515
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:08,850
won't be able to see with TLS yeah so in

516
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,250
fact it's using TLS and as an example

517
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:16,360
where you know payload inspection isn't

518
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:18,640
helpful from a DDoS perspective TLS

519
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,919
really doesn't play a significant role

520
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,760
you know both other companies and and

521
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:27,280
you know Nokia the do you know the the

522
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,810
anti-ddos technology will happily work

523
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:35,320
by understanding you know the source IPS

524
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:37,990
and the distribution now as I said I

525
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,750
think the payload mattered a lot more

526
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:44,470
ten years ago when the primary

527
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:47,170
mitigation for DDoS was looking into the

528
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:49,960
payload to find the invariant the things

529
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,610
that weren't spoofed typically random

530
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,680
numbers are hard or at least they're

531
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,209
expensive for computers way more

532
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,300
expensive than just replaying the same

533
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,070
packet so ten years ago for the

534
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,080
technology for when there was a lot of

535
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,419
spoofing it was trying to find what

536
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,389
someone forgot to randomize within their

537
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:10,000
replay traffic and picking that out with

538
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:12,160
spoofing no longer the majority and now

539
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,250
it's pretty small minority of the DDoS

540
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:18,970
we see the payload inspection is far

541
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:22,210
less relevant anything else one more all

542
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:24,490
right Tony Taylor from Comcast a good

543
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,290
talk and there's a lot of things I'm

544
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:30,670
thinking about and I'll probably think

545
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:32,080
of a better question to ask later but if

546
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:34,380
you could go back a few slides there is

547
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,379
one thing about source

548
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:41,860
you know spoofing sources did one of

549
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:48,490
them had like Google global content

550
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:51,260
cache or something in there up one yeah

551
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,790
this so

552
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:57,120
there are two different things what are

553
00:26:53,790 --> 00:27:00,420
those two Google like how do those play

554
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,500
into oh yeah so I was suggesting GGC was

555
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:06,300
just using GGC as sort of a relative

556
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,940
benchmark for ip's out there if you go

557
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,440
crawling the Google Safe Browsing is we

558
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,600
did integration with Google Safe

559
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,060
Browsing and it's curious for everything

560
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:19,500
that matches in fqdn how many ip's is

561
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:22,110
that in a given day for a network and

562
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,590
again that's resolving fqdn at any given

563
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,909
time via the dns the actual IPS matched

564
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:30,000
it was about twelve you know twelve

565
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:32,130
thirteen thousand just providing sort of

566
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,770
relative scale of the size of the

567
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,130
internet size of the threat oh okay so

568
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,510
it's not saying they are the source of

569
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,280
yeah I'm sorry this is part I actually

570
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,580
cobbled together slides from like three

571
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,700
different talks so I'm sorry but yeah

572
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,860
this is just relative magnitude but

573
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,570
that's roughly a number you get for what

574
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,659
we're seeing used over a period of

575
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,820
several weeks open resolvers I don't

576
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,800
think GGC though they might be causing

577
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:04,230
traffic headaches for you I don't think

578
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:05,850
they're actually attacking you okay I

579
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,070
think I'm just out of time maybe if

580
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,240
there's one more if not I think I'm all

581
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:14,539
set thank you

582
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,539
[Applause]

583
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,240
you
