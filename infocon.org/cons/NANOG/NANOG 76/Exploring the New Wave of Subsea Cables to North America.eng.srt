1
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:18,000
thanks very much my name is Tim I'm from

2
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,529
the market Telegraph II and the next 45

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,869
minutes should be hopefully pretty fun

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,430
here's what we've got scheduled I'm

5
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,710
gonna sort of set the stage with a

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,660
handful of slides for the first ten

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,300
minutes or so so there were going to

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,330
hand it over to the real experts here

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,339
the three panelists that we have for the

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,910
remainder of the session except for some

11
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:43,739
Q&A so be thinking of some zingers for

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:47,010
these guys so to start with I want to

13
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,690
really quickly cover five topics in ten

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,089
minutes I don't know if you remember the

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,890
micro machine commercial guy who spoke

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,059
really fast it's gonna be a little bit

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,129
like that I'm gonna keep it really short

18
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,120
as possible so I have more time to talk

19
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,968
to these guys but time allowing the five

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,500
topics I want to touch on are one lots

21
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,910
and lots of new cables have been going

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,590
in the water we're going to talk about

23
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,039
where they are and why they're being

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,570
built secondly on the flip side it

25
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,640
hasn't really happened yet but we think

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,110
there's a new wave of cable retirements

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,580
that's coming down the pike relatively

28
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,340
soon we'll talk about why that might

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,770
happen third why are all these cables

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,640
being built well one reason or they're a

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,619
handful of really big guys named Google

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,950
Facebook you probably have heard of them

33
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:36,509
AWS Microsoft need a lot of capacity

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,549
they're big users next we're talking

35
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,570
about price if you're if you've ever

36
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,310
purchased any long haul telecom services

37
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,100
you know there's one ironclad rule and

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,229
this prices always go down touch on that

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,520
and finally I want to set the stage for

40
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,619
our panel by talking about some

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,899
technology shifts that haven't really

42
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,399
changed the market yet but in 5-10 years

43
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,149
and they really change some of the way

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,740
we look at it and just when disclaimer

45
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,420
although these poor guys are up here

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,490
while I'm talking these aren't

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,289
necessarily their views most of what I

48
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,130
have to say isn't very controversial but

49
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:08,729
towards the end it's kind of

50
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,160
forward-looking

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:16,890
I know that Nigel in particular hates

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:19,049
the light you may - that's okay we don't

53
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,279
use the word hate though we you say

54
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:24,810
dislike

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:28,110
yeah okay lots of new cables have going

56
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,930
in the last few years here's a map of

57
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,110
them the gray dotted lines are existing

58
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,970
international repeated submarine cables

59
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,440
and the red lines are new cables I've

60
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,180
gone in the water the last two to three

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,090
years and if you look at it and try to

62
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,880
discern any pattern I can you may notice

63
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,800
a few one I notice is it some of these

64
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,459
cable to go to weird places and that's

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,590
because it

66
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,810
there wasn't much international

67
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,350
transport to them South Pacific Islands

68
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,220
there's a remnant of a cable that

69
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,750
originally was going to go all the way

70
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,700
across the Arctic didn't quite get

71
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,980
funding to do that but it did connect

72
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,250
some oil and gas communities in Native

73
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,380
communities on the north coast of Alaska

74
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:10,680
also there's not one but two cables now

75
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,600
connecting Africa to South America so if

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,400
you happen to need capacity between

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,359
Brazil and Cameroon I've got really good

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,739
news for you and the other thing that's

79
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,560
interesting to me you might find a

80
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,540
boring but there is a new cable across

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,430
the Atlantic and that's the third new

82
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,840
cable that we've seen across the

83
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,700
Atlantic also there's a new build across

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,070
the North Pacific these were really well

85
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,450
established routes and I remember at the

86
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,540
turn of the millennium some people were

87
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,410
saying we may never need a new cable

88
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,840
across the Atlantic coz there was such

89
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,930
an over build but now we have three and

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,340
there's more going in in the interest of

91
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,200
time I don't really want to go through

92
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,700
all the listings of these but I wanted

93
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,609
to include it in the packet in case you

94
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,700
had you're curious to know some

95
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,780
information on the individual cables

96
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,060
here they are the ones that have our

97
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,680
best in the last year and a half or two

98
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,269
years now you're looking at that map you

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,489
might think that it seems like a lot of

100
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:09,360
cables might cost a lot of money you'd

101
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:11,010
be right the last two years alone there

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,019
was more money spent in building

103
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,929
international submarine cables than any

104
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,810
in in a two year period since the boom

105
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,519
of 2000 2001 and we don't think that's a

106
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,860
one-time blip either we're kind of in

107
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,419
the middle of a really boom cycle right

108
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,010
now where are the new ones going in well

109
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,409
again if you look at the red lines

110
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,120
that's the planned the routes of the

111
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,680
plan cables that have been announced at

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,689
least

113
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,990
I would say not to get too attached to

114
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,460
this to this map some of these cables in

115
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,080
fact probably half of these cables won't

116
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,659
reach funding status to actually build

117
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,400
them but some will including several

118
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:51,060
across the North Pacific and several

119
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,580
across the North Atlantic one other

120
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,310
interesting thing about this is that

121
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,508
some of these cables are other

122
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,250
established routes like the United

123
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,889
States to Europe they're landing into

124
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,030
some unique destinations or landing

125
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,400
points that hadn't been touched before

126
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,520
Virginia Beach will be the site of three

127
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,878
at least three major intercontinental

128
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,840
cables and on the Europe side there's

129
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:19,469
landings in Bilbao Spain Numenor one in

130
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,810
France and sort of a potential for a

131
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:23,520
mini hub a little town in the northern

132
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:29,009
part of violet Ireland called kilowatt

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,750
and again here are the announced cables

134
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,610
that will cut to the United States this

135
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,080
is not just the world there's which is a

136
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,240
much longer list this is the ones just

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:42,120
touching in the United States over the

138
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:44,490
next few years now on the flip side sure

139
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,069
there's a lot of growth happening but we

140
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,110
think there may be time coming soon

141
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:52,110
where a lot of the old cables that went

142
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,580
in 1998 to 2001 start getting not

143
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,460
necessarily pulled out of water but

144
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,940
retired no longer actively maintained

145
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,289
and used

146
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,060
now I mentioned age already but it's

147
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,680
cable age isn't strictly the most

148
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,259
important consideration the economic

149
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,360
life of it is a lot of the older cables

150
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,159
aren't simply aren't as upgradable as

151
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,990
some of the newer cables and the most

152
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:15,509
important driving force for determining

153
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,330
economic viability when price is kind of

154
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,919
determined is your cost per bit and if

155
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,779
you can't expand that by increasing

156
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,810
demand on your cable if your upgrade is

157
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:26,699
is maxed out you're in trouble and at a

158
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,500
certain point it makes no sense to it to

159
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:34,830
maintain the cable so we do think that

160
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:36,449
there's a chance for some retirements no

161
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,250
I just said that don't talk about age

162
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:39,449
but I know I'm showing you a map showing

163
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,909
the age of cables I know it's a little

164
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,709
confusing but I was too lazy to map out

165
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:47,190
the upgrade ability of the cable so here

166
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,520
is by age the red and orange lines are

167
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,460
what two

168
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,289
for those the oldest cables and I guess

169
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,219
a couple things to look at the map one

170
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,840
is that there are so many international

171
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,150
simmering cables now that you can map

172
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,039
you can get a sense of the geographic

173
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,810
contours of Earth by just looking at the

174
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,419
cables without even showing anything

175
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,889
else another is if you look at the

176
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,190
Atlantic there are a lot of red and

177
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:11,970
orange lines there right so quite a few

178
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:13,919
cables that are in the prime of life

179
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:18,030
let's say if not approaching the end of

180
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,948
their life now why are we seeing so many

181
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,440
new cables built there's a huge number

182
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:25,020
of reasons probably number one are the

183
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,780
big users the big content providers for

184
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,090
the longest time for about 20 years the

185
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,619
dark blue area that you see on this

186
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,929
chart here which is our ISPs

187
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,389
international backbones they dominated

188
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,009
international bandwidth usage that's

189
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,449
what drove almost all of international

190
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:41,039
bandwidth demand but look what's

191
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,500
happened in the last few years just a

192
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,120
few years content providers have taken

193
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,849
over that's the Aqua or light blue

194
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,699
segment that you see there and again

195
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:52,169
that's just a handful of companies so

196
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,919
because there is just a few companies

197
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:57,180
and it's a large amount of usage that's

198
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,139
causing some disruption in the industry

199
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,449
and we'll talk about that on the panel

200
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:05,550
now their usage is not universal it's

201
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,550
not ubiquitous on some routes it's

202
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,759
really big look at the Atlantic over 80%

203
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,380
of international bandwidth demand now is

204
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,110
generated by just a handful of these

205
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,539
companies the content providers also on

206
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,509
the trans-pacific two-thirds is content

207
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:23,610
providers but Latin America only 25% are

208
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:28,199
so the traditional ISPs are still

209
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:30,630
driving the show there now with all

210
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,760
these cables in the water you might

211
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,828
think there is a huge amount of excess

212
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,750
capacity and if you look at it in some

213
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:39,718
ways it's true let's just look at the

214
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,000
Atlantic the traditional way of gauging

215
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,970
how much capacity capacity you have is

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,430
by measuring utilization and that's how

217
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,740
much capacity is lit divided by how much

218
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,829
capacity is potential you could

219
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:56,279
potentially like if you upgraded a the

220
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:58,349
dry plant gear on all the cables and on

221
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,450
the Atlantic at the end of 2017

222
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,810
32% we

223
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,580
utilizes less than a third now new cable

224
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,439
wind in the water and that utilization

225
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,050
rate actually went down last year only

226
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,290
to 28% so it seems like there's a huge

227
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,900
amount of excess capacity but it's

228
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:19,199
actually complicated to in some cases to

229
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,120
upgrade capacity but also a lot of the

230
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,240
largest users don't even want lit

231
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,920
services they want to hold weight nut'n

232
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,960
wavelengths but fiber pairs of their own

233
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,240
so let's look at how many free fiber

234
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,010
pairs there are across the Atlantic if

235
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,230
you look at the top line those are a

236
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,390
bunch of little rectangles each

237
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,810
rectangle represents an individual fiber

238
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,580
pair on a transatlantic submarine cable

239
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:45,000
and as of the end of last year there are

240
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,010
78 of those seems like a lot but if

241
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,500
you're a really big user you may want to

242
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,319
you may prefer to have fiber pairs on a

243
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,080
newer system you perhaps know a risk

244
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,280
retirement of an older system or you

245
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,470
don't want to bother with most

246
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,650
substantial for more difficult upgrades

247
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,990
so the fiber pairs that are less than 15

248
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,829
years old are only about 20 of those and

249
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,520
many of those have already been

250
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,170
purchased

251
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,660
sometimes the purchases have been

252
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,560
announced a lot of times they haven't

253
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,589
been announced they're private

254
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,030
transactions and best I can tell as of

255
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,430
earlier this year there are only three

256
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,250
spare fiber pairs and there probably is

257
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,020
even less now so what seems like we're

258
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,090
in an era of abundance we're actually an

259
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,380
era of scarcity and that's one of the

260
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:31,640
reasons we're seeing so many new bills

261
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:35,100
all right prices prices have gone down

262
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,449
now this chart is a little complicated

263
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,370
so let me just take a real quick moment

264
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,670
to explain it to you it's not showing

265
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,650
prices it's showing the markup over the

266
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,339
classic benchmark submarine cable route

267
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:50,250
which is New York to London so for

268
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:53,460
example back in 2013 the Johannesburg

269
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,980
London route was 36 times the cost of a

270
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,090
New York London circuit look what's

271
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,300
happened though in the last five years

272
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,860
prices have really converged London New

273
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,349
York prices have fallen about 18 percent

274
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:08,520
this is for a 10 gigabit per second

275
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:11,400
wavelength monthly lease for one they've

276
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,779
fallen 18% of the Atlantic down to South

277
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,600
Africa it's fallen by a kegger of

278
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:19,839
over 40 percent so the prices have

279
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,959
really fallen $300,000 for a monthly

280
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:28,089
lease for a 10 gig wave to Joburg around

281
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,949
20,000 now also on the the Miami South

282
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:31,569
Paulo route 35% kegger

283
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:36,550
so that would those prices all around

284
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:38,559
the world of really compressed last few

285
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:41,258
slides here before we transition to the

286
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,730
panel some technology shifts that are

287
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:44,499
happening and I haven't really been

288
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,879
truly disruptive yet but it's going to

289
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:49,180
be very interesting to follow what's

290
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:52,540
going to happen the next few years one

291
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,519
area of focus is less on ringing out the

292
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,969
last little bit of potential capacity on

293
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,980
a single fiber pair and instead focusing

294
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,050
on overall capacity on a cable so that

295
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,959
means perhaps less capacity per fiber

296
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,389
pair in using that power to have more

297
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,878
fiber pairs overall in a cable for

298
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:12,699
example is classically we would have six

299
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:16,629
five repairs on a repeater system across

300
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:18,790
the ocean remember these are have to be

301
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:20,350
powered into end their repeaters that

302
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,670
have to be powered every 50 kilometers

303
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,350
or so it's not like a your terrestrial

304
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:27,878
fiber where you can have a couple

305
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:29,740
hundred the next big cable across the

306
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,110
Atlantic which will be a Google and

307
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,360
called dunal which is gonna be 12 hour

308
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,930
pairs there's research to do 16 buy

309
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,860
repairs and a hope at least to do 30 to

310
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:43,449
5 repairs what can this do to price well

311
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,850
this part is speculative we don't really

312
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:48,250
know yet but what we're looking at here

313
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:52,569
are the minimum investment unit for

314
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:55,240
prices for capacity and cables over time

315
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:57,699
you go back all the way to the left if

316
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,300
you needed 150 voice channels back in

317
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:03,579
1988 on the one of the first fiber optic

318
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,849
cables that costs a little less than 10

319
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:09,008
million dollars a 10 gig wave and iru

320
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,740
for 10 gigs less than 10 years ago is

321
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:14,410
about the same price but if we can

322
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,759
achieve 30 to 5 repair systems look what

323
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,350
the price is going to be in the future

324
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:21,730
less than what we would have paid for a

325
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,660
10 gig wave just eight years ago so that

326
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,279
will be interesting to see what happens

327
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:29,379
and finally even if we can build the

328
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,689
giant really fat cables that probably

329
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:33,339
about five times the capacity of a

330
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:37,149
current cable thanks to all the new

331
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:38,649
fiber pairs will that be enough it's

332
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,240
really hard to say but there are just

333
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,689
two things I want to point out here on

334
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,120
this final slide one you can see the

335
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:48,309
columns going down that's the number of

336
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,279
cables across the ocean this is the

337
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:52,719
Atlantic and is going down because we

338
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,879
think they're going to be retirements

339
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,889
when that exactly is going to happen we

340
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,370
don't really know yet but we're pretty

341
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:02,259
confident your options are going to be

342
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,839
being reduced for a few years but after

343
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:08,199
that there's gonna be a need for a lot

344
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:14,800
of cables I think some of us may

345
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:16,748
disagree but if and just a I should say

346
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,160
just a few percentage points a margin of

347
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:20,350
error makes a huge difference when

348
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,569
compounded over time but if you take

349
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,009
sort of the median glide path down for

350
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:26,559
demand even if his demand is only

351
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:29,259
growing 25% a year which is lower than

352
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,420
the 60% we're seeing now we're going to

353
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:33,699
need 41 new cables across the Atlantic

354
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:37,959
the next 15 years and if this held true

355
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:40,180
eight cables alone in the Year 2035 that

356
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:43,149
would cause all sorts of disruption need

357
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,430
new ships need new cable manufacturing

358
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:47,250
plants frankly probably need new

359
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:51,430
licensing regimes in these countries

360
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,860
just to get the permitting to allow for

361
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:57,160
all the new build

362
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:00,189
so with that talk about the future I'm

363
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,339
going to move back to the current time

364
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:04,930
and move to our panel thank you

365
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:10,209
gentlemen for joining us I'm gonna have

366
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:11,709
a seat if you don't mind let's start

367
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,969
before we get into the topics if you

368
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:16,059
don't mind just introducing yourself

369
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,649
really quick and talk about how your

370
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:19,899
company is touching the international

371
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:22,629
cable community Brian do you mind

372
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,819
starting so I'm Brian LaBrie I'm working

373
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:27,490
from working with Siena I'm based in

374
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:29,529
Montreal and I'm in leading the

375
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,149
submarine network solutions team Siena

376
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,439
is a company we build the terminals we

377
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,850
don't build a wet plant sitting on the

378
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,949
bottom of the oceans but we build the

379
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,780
terminal sitting on the end point

380
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,670
and then all the terrestrial backhaul

381
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,560
links that will take that submarine

382
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,589
traffic right into a central office or a

383
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,380
data center good morning everybody my

384
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:50,080
name is Eric ComTech I'm from globe net

385
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:52,210
low-mid owns and operates subsea cable

386
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,560
network that starts in the US and two

387
00:15:52,210 --> 00:16:00,760
locations Miami and New Jersey and from

388
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:03,579
there we go south serve Brazil Colombia

389
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,710
Venezuela Bermuda and pretty soon we're

390
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,720
gonna be landing in Argentina as well so

391
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:12,310
we're in an international operator and

392
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,930
we focus on the hotel business only and

393
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,930
I'm the Nigel that doesn't agree with

394
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,910
him on the final slide I'm Nigel bailiff

395
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,370
on the CEO of aqua comms we own one

396
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,620
cable and operate it across from New

397
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,120
York to to Ireland were building the

398
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,430
second cable which goes from New Jersey

399
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,070
to Denmark calling in to Ireland and

400
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,319
Norway I've been in the submarine cable

401
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:36,040
industry for over 30 years the first

402
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,700
cable I worked on was 1988 which retired

403
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:45,069
about 10 years later in just just past

404
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:48,550
the 1918 1998 timeframe and that was all

405
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:52,360
on the Atlantic it just to introduce you

406
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:54,880
guys to the nanog group this is only my

407
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,310
fifth time at an ANA meeting so I still

408
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:02,700
consider myself a newbie but just to

409
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:04,810
warn you these people are animals okay

410
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,110
they're the nicest people you'll ever

411
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,520
meet

412
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:09,399
some of the smartest people you ever

413
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,829
meet but if they sense any weakness in

414
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,440
your line of argument they're gonna tear

415
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,540
you to shreds during Q&A okay

416
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,410
so just two pieces of advice one don't

417
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,639
say anything stupid and secondly avoid

418
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,970
any questions from the ones with

419
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,180
ponytails they're the most powerful okay

420
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:30,040
I feel very welcome this is my first

421
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,040
nano can I see you even put a little

422
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,080
green square on to show virgin status on

423
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,418
my

424
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,309
and so I've been picked out as a virgin

425
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,740
already so I'm kind of fresh meat to the

426
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:41,370
to the slaughter fest that's about to

427
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,440
ensue

428
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,779
y'all be nice to Nigel he's English yeah

429
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,500
I'm English for goodness sake his name's

430
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,590
Nigel

431
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,909
yeah alright let's start with technology

432
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,189
and Brian I think I'd like to start with

433
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:55,850
you sure or the course that conversation

434
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:59,250
I don't really want to direct you guys

435
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:02,850
you know as a puppet you think we're

436
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,200
gonna be quiet right no I don't okay can

437
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,719
you talk about a little bit about the

438
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,600
Shannon limit I know all of us know it

439
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,250
theoretically in terms of powered

440
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,500
communications but what does it mean

441
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,850
specifically for repeated international

442
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,700
submarine cables and why is it a problem

443
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,289
now sure so what I find amazing about

444
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,600
Shannon's limited his paper on

445
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:23,789
information theory goes back to 1948 and

446
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,490
only now we're dealing with the actual

447
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:28,080
technical ramifications in a nutshell is

448
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,750
to maximum capacity you can put over a

449
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,789
submarine fiber and it's driven

450
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,409
primarily by three things by bandwidth -

451
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:36,450
signal power and the noise figure

452
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:37,710
now the bandwidth is dictated when you

453
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,240
put the submarine cable in the water

454
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,399
right and that's dictated by the

455
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,870
spectral width of your amplifiers we

456
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,469
call them repeater still that's kind of

457
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,149
a misnomer

458
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:48,120
they don't do optical electrical optical

459
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:49,408
conversion anymore it's a EDFA based

460
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,389
amplifier similar to a terrestrial

461
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:53,100
network yeah but for some reason we're

462
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:55,590
still calling them repeaters so that

463
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,939
spectral risk is fixed which means the

464
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,649
amount of bandwidth you can actually use

465
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,269
once that cables in the water is fixed

466
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:00,989
unless you want to pull it out and do

467
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:03,149
some stuff to it

468
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,070
you have the noise figure you know we're

469
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:07,379
about as low as we can go on these

470
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,269
optical amplifiers and then you're stuck

471
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,039
with the the signal power what can you

472
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:12,269
do with it it can only raise the signal

473
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,340
power high enough before you start

474
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:16,620
melting the fiber you know so we push it

475
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,299
as high as we can but then you end up

476
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,029
working in what's called the nonlinear

477
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,710
domain the higher power you pushed on an

478
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:24,720
optical fiber raises all kinds of other

479
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,100
issues you have to deal with so we're

480
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,200
pretty close to the Shannon limit now

481
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,418
you know we make and we made no enormous

482
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,250
gains over the last decade now we've had

483
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,570
cables that you know we're carrying a

484
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,700
hundred times more traffic than they

485
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,480
were originally designed for but now

486
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,460
we're at the point of diminishing

487
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,750
returns where we can invest a lot of

488
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,070
money time and effort on new

489
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,590
technologies these are the modems

490
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,560
sitting on the in the terminals but now

491
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,230
we're starting to see

492
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,669
diminishing returns and sooner or later

493
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,620
we're gonna have to start deploying new

494
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,000
cables and new types of cables which are

495
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,610
the SDM ones we're probably going to

496
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,340
cover and and challenge limit is warm

497
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:00,370
limit there's another limit which is my

498
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:04,360
first argument why this slide maybe

499
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:06,639
isn't correct is the electrical power

500
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,010
gap that you put down the cable because

501
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,830
the cable has a copper jacket a copper

502
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,540
sleeve around a fiber package and and

503
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,860
we're actually just experimenting with

504
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,250
I'll say it your way

505
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,290
aluminum but my way aluminium conductor

506
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,080
to try and get some cost savings but

507
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:26,409
that copper is a high purity copper one

508
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,629
ohm per kilometer so it's a high quality

509
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,580
copper that's very expensive we all know

510
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,080
that from the manufacturing and you know

511
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,899
the obtaining of copper for making

512
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,120
equipment that's sticky and electrical

513
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,710
power down the cable to power the

514
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,750
amplifiers and at some point we're going

515
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,670
to start to hit limits around the amount

516
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,970
of electrical power that can be turned

517
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,170
into optical boost power at the SDM you

518
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,000
know level where you can share that

519
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,950
power across multiple fiber pairs so

520
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,450
once you start to get to sixteen fiber

521
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,580
pairs you're getting close to some of

522
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,890
those limits if you thicken the copper

523
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,220
layer you massively thicken the

524
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,600
polyethylene insulation layer you

525
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,640
effectively have to also thicken the

526
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,709
strength members the king wires inside

527
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,120
the cable because you've opened up the

528
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,370
hole in the middle that carries the

529
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,479
fibers through on all of that takes the

530
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:18,209
costs in an exponential way higher so

531
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:26,800
the first argument is cost and power

532
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:29,920
number one all right do you see if we do

533
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,649
move to high fiber a pair account cables

534
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,540
do you ever foresee the emergence of a

535
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,610
wholesale provider just of fiber pairs

536
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,250
or do you think we're kind of maxed out

537
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,990
at we're selling right now what we're

538
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,840
going to be selling twenty years from

539
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:46,270
now which is 100 gig waves how about you

540
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,490
Eric what do you think no I think I

541
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,540
think there's there's still room to do

542
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:55,110
things let's say in the industry

543
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,060
and what we're seeing is so we saw tests

544
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,790
a couple years ago where to try to play

545
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,879
with different modulation technologies C

546
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:04,889
plus L versus just a standard C band and

547
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,090
so the whole idea was that in a fiber

548
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,760
pair you could put twice as much

549
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,970
capacity by using different let's say

550
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,400
bands and there's a practical limitation

551
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,140
to that which is again cost right you

552
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,930
would have to change an entire nation to

553
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,180
go on to the L band before it becomes

554
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,610
economically viable to really run it so

555
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,800
there's only one such cable system in

556
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,550
existence today which is the Pacific

557
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,810
light cable across and it's a transit

558
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,450
cable what's ours I know is still not

559
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:35,070
live there's other issues there but but

560
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,840
but yes but the reality is that in the

561
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:40,050
mean time people said wait a minute

562
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,240
if the whole idea is to get a lower cost

563
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,740
per bit that's that's the wrong

564
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,840
direction so what we got to do is we got

565
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,130
to increase fire repairs right and if

566
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,199
you look at some of the systems that you

567
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,760
have today or that happen announced and

568
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,190
you talk to the vendors they'll say well

569
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,310
let's be creative of what we can do in

570
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:58,800
the repeater so they look at all these

571
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,419
elements like how much power how much

572
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,190
can I put in the fiber kind of make the

573
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,320
fiber better and all that stuff but

574
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,390
there's also real practical limitation

575
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,370
to this you have to lay the cable you

576
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,990
have ships that are designed to take a

577
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,060
repeater of a certain size

578
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:15,390
the moment you start adding five repairs

579
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,830
to this thing it's almost impossible

580
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,230
unless you start building new ships

581
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,300
right so what they're trying to do is

582
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,160
they're trying to say let me add let me

583
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,200
go from four to six to eight five

584
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,600
repairs now they're talking 12 - not

585
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,240
just 12 and the next Facebook cable

586
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,800
across the transatlantic is 16 so for

587
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,920
those of you that are in the terrestrial

588
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,950
world we're used to seeing 296 count

589
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,530
fiber whatever 500 doesn't matter but in

590
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:43,740
the subsea world a45 repair system not

591
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,149
that long ago was a big cable so what

592
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,950
you're doing is you're puppy that many

593
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,260
more waves on the fiber pair and you

594
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,470
don't have a luxury of physically having

595
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,970
more right so I do believe that you're

596
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,710
gonna see some of these cables and

597
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,930
you've you talked to the vendors they're

598
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:01,470
already talking about well we'll do 16

599
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:03,810
maybe 24 maybe 36 but at some point

600
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,540
that's going to stop because physically

601
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,419
you cannot put

602
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,340
or fire repairs and to into a particular

603
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,800
cable right in your cost gonna go up

604
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,070
exponentially but I think it's it's

605
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,169
interesting that the the sauce strata of

606
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,629
the transport side of the industry you

607
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:22,360
know not not necessarily services or

608
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:24,550
Ethernet but just pure transport has

609
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,560
changed you know it used to be PT T's

610
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:28,330
all got together said hey guys we need

611
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,830
to send phone calls to each other let's

612
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,379
all get together and decide when to

613
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:35,290
build cables and it was all fairly you

614
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,570
know calm and and and and fairly orderly

615
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,879
people invested they built a cable they

616
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,970
built another one five years later it

617
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,470
helped with a kind of a nice slow

618
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:46,450
increase in technology and then we had

619
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,160
this craziness around the dot-com boom

620
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,200
where you know seven companies

621
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,060
essentially took the same market study

622
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,950
and said we're gonna get 50% market

623
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,020
share and got the money went out build

624
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,180
the cables started to fall in on itself

625
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,680
so there was an over build and a price

626
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,870
crash and I mean we know all the history

627
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,750
of that and we can see it and it's part

628
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,550
of our issue today because in general

629
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,350
I'm guessing you know most of the people

630
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,820
in the room don't worry too much about

631
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,770
the cost because it is actually pretty

632
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,810
low if you think about what's happening

633
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,910
200 million dollars to build a cable

634
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,620
across the Atlantic and you know to buy

635
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:20,200
into a little slice of it that you need

636
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:24,219
for your you know running your pocket

637
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,950
network is is relatively low cost versus

638
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,100
building out infrastructure yourself so

639
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,970
in the industry you see in a weird

640
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,250
stratification going on where there are

641
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,710
some infra funds so our companies owned

642
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:38,500
by infrastructure money by you know

643
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,720
utility style money everything was

644
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,460
previously peaked by private equity

645
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,310
money and let's go for the quick payback

646
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,870
it's very hard to go a quick payback so

647
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,220
if you were in a position where you're

648
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,290
building a cable a couple hundred

649
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,000
million dollars at risk going into the

650
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,710
sea and it can go wrong you know we're

651
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,600
talking about the sea here four thousand

652
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,850
meters deep in the Atlantic as a as a

653
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,419
deepest point roughly roughly where the

654
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:03,879
Titanic is off off the Flemish cap and

655
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:06,070
you you build that cable it could be

656
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,050
worthless day one because it might start

657
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,909
to have you know aggression problems it

658
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:12,610
might start to have seismic problems etc

659
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:15,760
so you're risking that capital if you

660
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,178
sell all that out day one in fiber pairs

661
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,879
and make

662
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,409
you make a 5 10 15 percent return and go

663
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:23,199
straight back into risking your high

664
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:25,029
cycle your capital whereas most infra

665
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,840
funds are looking for a slow you know

666
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:31,389
fairly regular eyes 8 9 10 percent over

667
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,879
20 years return so the Capitals not

668
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:35,619
matching the construction side of life

669
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:37,959
but one thing is for sure it's all

670
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:39,459
changing and if you look at your AT&T s

671
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,409
and your Verizon's and your Vodafone's

672
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,419
and your companies like that they are

673
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:45,820
very vertical you know they have some

674
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:47,679
submarine stuff down here they have IOT

675
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,418
investment up here they have all these

676
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,179
legacy support systems they have their

677
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:53,529
core networks their terrestrial networks

678
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,720
where do they focus you know where do

679
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:57,490
they focus their capital should they be

680
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,869
building submarine cables probably not

681
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,559
anymore and and they aren't you know

682
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:04,330
AT&T Verizon and actually Centrelink the

683
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,119
owner of many cables from the level 3

684
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,949
acquisition aren't particularly part of

685
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,649
the new build phase so there's an

686
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,749
interesting change come in a row let's

687
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:16,779
talk about who who are driving the new

688
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:18,730
cable builds I know you're more of an

689
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:20,049
equipment guy Brian but I know also full

690
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,619
well that you're quite familiar with the

691
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:25,360
content guys yes so the content guys are

692
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:27,220
driving it I mean before it was people

693
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,600
talking to people as a Nigel mentioned

694
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,639
right and we're talking phone calls you

695
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,769
know 64 kilobits signals bunch of people

696
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:35,229
talking easy to manage easy to project

697
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:36,549
the growth then the ICPs came along the

698
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,480
internet content providers now we're

699
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:39,700
talking about machine to machine

700
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,289
communication we're talking about data

701
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,940
centers talking the data centers here

702
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:44,379
for a backup and restore for load

703
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,720
balancing and a whole bunch of internal

704
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:48,580
things that they do I don't see that

705
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,659
slowing down by any sense I mean I don't

706
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,428
see people putting away their

707
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:54,279
smartphones stop watching streaming

708
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:56,230
television it's just gonna get more and

709
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:59,019
more bandwidth across via these sub C

710
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,669
links they actually see the network

711
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:02,440
though quite different right if you're a

712
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:05,950
wholesaler you actually sell the network

713
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,749
service if you're an ICP you sell ads so

714
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,029
the network is a means to get to the

715
00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:11,259
eyeballs so you know they're they also

716
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:13,450
have no legacy they're not a hundred

717
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:15,340
years old in terms of a typical you know

718
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,529
network operator so they're far more

719
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,990
interested in the newer technology they

720
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,700
have no legacy baggage to deal with when

721
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,919
we talk to the ICPs as an equipment

722
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,240
vendor versus a wholesale operator very

723
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,000
often the discussions are quite

724
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,650
different

725
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,380
but I don't know if you hear the same

726
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:33,260
story as those which is that you know up

727
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:37,070
to 70% of that traffic is not the

728
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,560
content or the eyeballs it's the AI you

729
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,510
know computation and flinging of data

730
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,669
backwards and forwards about how people

731
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,110
are receiving the content or how people

732
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,180
are watching the content or how people

733
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:49,820
are interacting with the content so it

734
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,470
it's truly a machine to machine and you

735
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:56,689
know one theory which is number two

736
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:58,900
about this slide is that if if the cost

737
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,490
of that were to start to trend upwards

738
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,740
would it be the same so if international

739
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,530
band which cost what it cost 20 years

740
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:09,370
ago in proportion to service costs over

741
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:11,570
telecommunication service would people

742
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:14,179
operate like that or would they change

743
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,700
their algorithms you know that the 64

744
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:19,210
kilobits group for fax coding you know

745
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,800
was a mathematical Huffman you know

746
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,410
mathematical calculation to send less

747
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,510
information precisely because it was

748
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,360
expensive to run International circuit

749
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:31,760
so you try to get the information in a

750
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,280
different format to send less of it less

751
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,990
dense information so does that have

752
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,379
start to come back if costs start to

753
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:42,320
creep back up again I don't know so cont

754
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,480
providers on markets in the world where

755
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,520
the price is already really low best I

756
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,280
can tell it's almost impossible to fund

757
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,860
a new cable without the participation of

758
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:55,490
it least one or usually two of the

759
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:57,409
really big content guys yeah so do you

760
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,940
see the content providers participation

761
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:01,490
in this sub C industry as a good thing

762
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,590
is it gonna destroy telecom

763
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,720
international telecoms as we know it or

764
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,699
is it kind of a mixed blessing I think

765
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,130
those are very different questions right

766
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:13,760
and for example we're partnering with

767
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:17,420
with large OTT to send our network to

768
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,920
Argentina right and Nigel and what other

769
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:21,620
cables partnering with let's say -

770
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,230
there's potentially 302 T's on the cable

771
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:27,250
right the issues what Brian mentioned

772
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:29,050
before is that for those of us that

773
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,000
own networks and are here to make money

774
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,830
off of the network right we want to

775
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,900
maximize our return let's say in the

776
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,790
cable whereas the OT T's aren't the

777
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,190
others end of the spectrum where for

778
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:42,190
them its lowest cost per bit right so

779
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:44,200
finding a common medium that that works

780
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:46,630
for both is very very difficult right

781
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,970
so what's clear is that number one along

782
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,340
the main routes they're the ones that

783
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,690
are driving the built for sure as a

784
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,159
matter of fact Google is starting to

785
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,410
build the cables by themselves and

786
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,780
they're building extra fiber pairs so

787
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:00,940
that they have additional fiber pairs to

788
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,760
swap on other systems around the world

789
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,830
right so in their model of the world is

790
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,450
flat is perfect all right let me give

791
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,310
you a 5 appear in the trans-pacific and

792
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,060
exchange for a 5 repair let's say to

793
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:16,290
Africa right so that may work for them

794
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:19,360
but in our let's say carrier world even

795
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:21,040
in the ISP world there is a market

796
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,520
dynamic there that you have to play with

797
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:27,370
right and and so I think that in the

798
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,170
main routes they're gonna be driving for

799
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:32,770
the foreseeable future all the builds

800
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:34,300
for sure no question right so then if

801
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:36,250
you look at the regional market it

802
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,560
really depends how big that regional

803
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,300
market is and where is that regional

804
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,490
market in its development phase as a

805
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,700
market right if you look for example at

806
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,920
Brazil Google was the first one to start

807
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,240
to build in a consortium now that both

808
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,260
the data center and she'll a couple

809
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,940
years ago and now they're building a

810
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,640
cable from Chile to the US or doing that

811
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,080
by themselves Facebook has agreed to

812
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,230
partner because that model works

813
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,030
different so I think from its it's very

814
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:03,460
difficult to and you should not throw

815
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,050
all the OT T's in the same bucket right

816
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,430
their networks are different the way the

817
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,980
the data centers are laid out is

818
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:10,950
different Facebook for example only has

819
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,090
data centers in the northern hemisphere

820
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:14,490
right so what they're trying to do is

821
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:18,129
they're trying to put those all together

822
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:20,110
if you see them go into South America or

823
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:22,390
Africa whatever is because that's to

824
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:24,010
service the access network right so it's

825
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:28,660
understanding these ltg's that's

826
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:31,030
important but I do believe that they're

827
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,580
trying to disrupt the industry because

828
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:34,750
it's it's expensive to lay a cable it's

829
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,710
expensive to design it

830
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,960
it's expensive to to service it

831
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:42,179
the problem is and I've said that many

832
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,860
many times you cannot disrupt

833
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:46,409
infrastructure the way you disrupt

834
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,178
software right just something's gonna

835
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:50,010
break and if you're gonna build a

836
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,230
network for the next 25 years there's a

837
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,510
lot that goes into the building of that

838
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:56,580
infrastructure right look our network

839
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,799
was built 15 years ago so we're now a

840
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,260
legacy system and there are segments

841
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,330
that have never ever gone down why

842
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,460
because it was very well designed very

843
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:09,000
well lay the cable was buried well and

844
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,950
and we've been maintaining and watching

845
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,840
the network very carefully to make sure

846
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,240
that if there's a ship close by you call

847
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,770
it the port authorities because it it's

848
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,210
not like I can do a truck rolled on

849
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:21,740
trucks on network I need to send out a

850
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:24,179
ship at 75 200 thousand dollars a day

851
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:26,429
and it could take me a month to repair

852
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:29,429
right so that's more eula per bit better

853
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:32,279
the the country wherever is and the

854
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:34,740
remedy and all that stuff right so so

855
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,029
it's it's tough look I think I think

856
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,919
there definitely in the driver's seat

857
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:40,679
they're pushing technology which is good

858
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,049
the question is is it viable over a long

859
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,909
period of time seems we have mentioned

860
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:48,029
the r-word either which is regulation

861
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:50,789
you know there's a they have an eye on

862
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:53,039
regulation and wanting to try and avoid

863
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:55,080
it where possible so actually including

864
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,510
carriers with them in a partnership

865
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,820
types since making sure some of that

866
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,679
asset is able to be used by the wider

867
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,960
group of people who want to use that

868
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,990
kind of facility you know between two

869
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,980
countries is perhaps a tactic to avoid

870
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:12,030
you know some kind of dominance

871
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,250
regulation or at least the perception

872
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,720
it's not maybe just him on the

873
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,830
technology side I tend to see it a

874
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,020
little bit different I mean as a

875
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,219
technology evangelist I think it's

876
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,139
actually good that they've come into the

877
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,549
market for a variety of reasons if you

878
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,839
look at this every networking industry

879
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,300
for decades and decades it was

880
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:28,889
relatively closed proprietary you know

881
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,950
for historical economic and political

882
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,750
reasons one coherent networking was

883
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:35,759
invented it was actually invented for a

884
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,830
terrestrial network application and that

885
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,210
was from New York to Los Angeles you

886
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,369
know the longest distance that we were

887
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,750
supporting at the time we got invited to

888
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:44,040
test it on a submarine cable in the

889
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,810
Caribbean nobody's going to say no to

890
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,790
that

891
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,199
and lo and behold 40 gate cohere and

892
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:50,210
actually worked better than the 10 gig

893
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,620
incumbents wavelength so the proverbial

894
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,720
light bulb went off and suddenly

895
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,159
coherent was not all over terrestrial

896
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,109
networks but now is over submarine

897
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,609
networks I think that's accelerated in

898
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,260
the last few years if you look at other

899
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,800
technologies like machine learning

900
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,820
artificial intelligence telemetry these

901
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,320
technologies that are born in the data

902
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,710
center is finding their way into

903
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,480
submarine networks as well so the ICPs

904
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,280
we tend to bucket them in one group and

905
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,530
you're exactly right if you talk to them

906
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,900
they see themselves in an industry by

907
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,760
themselves they are truly different but

908
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,360
I think their dedication to open trying

909
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,980
new things

910
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,480
on the terrestrial side is finding its

911
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,190
way into the submarine network as well

912
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,930
yeah I think that's a positive side of

913
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,010
things yeah exactly very much so

914
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,629
so Eric you said something interesting

915
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,920
by the way we've got ten minutes so if

916
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:34,370
you have any questions start thinking

917
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:37,220
about him now please you mentioned that

918
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:38,180
all OTS are different or called content

919
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,129
providers a different way you're going

920
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,359
to call them probably a lot of the

921
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,390
companies in here if you look at a

922
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:47,240
certain way our content providers or ot

923
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:50,900
T's and I imagine you you guys have a

924
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:54,319
mix of methods for connectivity probably

925
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:56,720
the smaller of you use dia a lot of you

926
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,580
probably buy IP transit some of you may

927
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,899
if you're not buying transport now are

928
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,750
thinking about dipping your toes in the

929
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,030
market so what I was curious to know is

930
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,950
what advice do you have for people that

931
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,440
are new to the submarine cable industry

932
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,359
they're looking to buy some wave lengths

933
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,900
for the first time what would you tell

934
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:18,620
them yeah be careful what you buy and

935
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:21,290
really clearly understand IP transit you

936
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:24,350
know has an element of redundancy and

937
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:29,150
resilience built in a submarine cable

938
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:30,860
between a and B can and will get cut you

939
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:33,230
know for various reasons usually

940
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:36,500
external aggression usually a fishing

941
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,810
boat or an anchor or or you know some

942
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,690
kind of seismic event and when it's cut

943
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:45,500
it's it's in the region of fifteen to

944
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:47,060
thirty days days to repair it to send a

945
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,160
ship out into the mid-atlantic to bring

946
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,620
the cable to the surface put in a new

947
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,960
piece and put it back down so if you buy

948
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,819
transport make sure you buy several

949
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,210
transports from several different

950
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,920
parties with

951
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,200
much deduplication as you can manage

952
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,090
which is why in your slide around the

953
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,589
new cables they're going to different

954
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,930
countries now they used to all go into

955
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:10,380
the south of the UK they're now going to

956
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:12,990
Norway Denmark Ireland UK France and

957
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,270
Spain so they're spread out for exactly

958
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:17,279
that resilience reason so just really

959
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:20,430
really get under the surface of what

960
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,560
you're buying and and and try and buy

961
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:25,049
from the as close to the owner of the

962
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,080
infrastructure as you can and don't have

963
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:30,270
to be careful what did you say maybe era

964
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,490
can answer this but what are the

965
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,860
pitfalls of a buy on a cable if you're

966
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,509
buying on a few different paths what do

967
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,970
you have to look out for you said be

968
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:40,470
careful what you're buying have you seen

969
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,990
any mistakes that buyers have made in

970
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:44,640
the past well I've seen I've seen buyers

971
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,140
for example that say hey let me try to

972
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,359
squeeze a buck here there and then they

973
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,920
buy the threshold pays the backhaul and

974
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,630
separate from the subsidy separate from

975
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,910
the other backhaul sudden you have three

976
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,380
separate contracts right and then if

977
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,120
they don't pay attention to what they're

978
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,310
buying they may be buying from different

979
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,230
vendors or providers on the backhaul

980
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:04,080
side happened to be all the same network

981
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:06,210
right so so getting into the detail as

982
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,890
to where does that fiber run who

983
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,590
actually knows the fiber and what ducts

984
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,569
is a fiber we have a lot more issues on

985
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:16,200
the threshold piece than we have on the

986
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,550
subsea piece right if you look at what

987
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,799
some of the large ot T's are doing

988
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:22,620
Facebook for example they would prefer

989
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,970
to have five totally diverse routes now

990
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,859
of course we're running at let's say

991
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,020
thirty three percent utilization of a

992
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,700
fiber pair but they say look if I have

993
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,590
two five pairs that can maybe carry the

994
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,600
traffic but if I grow it's not going to

995
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,820
work then they go to three say what if I

996
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,730
have a double cut I cannot afford for my

997
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:41,130
users to to be disenchanted and then I

998
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:43,410
lose at revenue so therefore let me over

999
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,980
build let's say that redundancy that

1000
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:48,240
works for them I think for a smaller

1001
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,760
provider if you have three routes is

1002
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,500
probably good to as marginal depending

1003
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,720
out how much of that capacity you're

1004
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,730
using but again you have to really look

1005
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,370
at the end-to-end solution if you want

1006
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,930
to go from New York to London you've got

1007
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,779
to pick your battles as well or you've

1008
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,609
asked the provider to say

1009
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:08,150
give me that end-to-end and guarantee

1010
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:10,130
the end-to-end not just a piece and just

1011
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,839
in terms of upgraded every submarine

1012
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,429
cable has a unique personality which

1013
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,439
means you have unique Shanna's limits so

1014
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:16,459
if you're buying a fiber pair typically

1015
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,689
it's because you want to be in control

1016
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:20,448
of your own destiny you want to upgrade

1017
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:22,788
to capacity as you see fit

1018
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:24,079
given the each submarine cable has a

1019
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:25,640
unique personality you might want to

1020
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,049
check into the performance of that fiber

1021
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,219
pair you know what's sitting in that wet

1022
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:30,229
plan under seed because that'll

1023
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:32,119
ultimately dictate the maximum capacity

1024
00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:33,828
you can run over that fiber pair and

1025
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,739
you'll know you'll see across similar

1026
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:38,179
cables in terms of routes the upgrade

1027
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:40,159
capacity of your fiber pair could be

1028
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:41,989
quite different so in particular if it's

1029
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,359
an older system exactly with lots of

1030
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:45,829
cuts your power budget goes down every

1031
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:48,469
time a cable gets cut and before you

1032
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:50,209
know it the design may be whatever 10th

1033
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:53,539
Turbots by the time you get it it's less

1034
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:55,669
than 5 exactly yeah I do y'all have any

1035
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:57,619
questions this is my favorite part of

1036
00:39:55,669 --> 00:40:00,348
every single nanak session even if i

1037
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:03,140
mentally check out of one because it

1038
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:04,489
doesn't apply to me i always perk up for

1039
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:10,788
the bloodsport in the last five minutes

1040
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:16,189
or so any questions does he have a

1041
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:18,890
ponytail no okay I cut that off so okay

1042
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:21,890
so a couple minutes ago there was an

1043
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:24,019
interesting presentation done by Paul I

1044
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:25,788
just point his name but basically

1045
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:29,089
talking about global warming and sea

1046
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:30,859
water rise and all hold us from will

1047
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:31,699
pole hold us from the world ocean

1048
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:35,869
Council

1049
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:38,119
I don't know but basically the gist of

1050
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:39,799
it was the landing sites for some of

1051
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,969
these cables would potentially

1052
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:42,469
eventually be underwater

1053
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:44,929
do you actually view that as a concern

1054
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:47,019
what's being done about it you know kind

1055
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:50,150
where your thoughts along those lines

1056
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:53,868
what when you power a submarine cable

1057
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:56,239
you inject DC volts so you inject DC

1058
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:57,619
volts negative from one end and positive

1059
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,959
from the other end to a balanced earth

1060
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:01,400
in the center and on the Atlantic you're

1061
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:04,038
throwing in about three and a half

1062
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,709
thousand volts from each end so negative

1063
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,059
DC three and a half one and positive DC

1064
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:09,788
three and a half and then it drops in

1065
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:12,660
the repeaters and through the copper

1066
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:15,960
that doesn't mix with being underwater

1067
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,899
right so so the I mean I've heard there

1068
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,030
are some locations that have had their

1069
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,369
below kind of floodplain areas and they

1070
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,170
build bund walls around the station for

1071
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:27,930
the once in a hundred years

1072
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:30,569
tide plus wind plus this which is gonna

1073
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,730
mean an inundation but the the the

1074
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:34,950
global warming story for somewhere like

1075
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:36,780
the the Maldives and I built two

1076
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,640
submarine cables to the Maldives believe

1077
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,950
it or not it's a tiny little well it's a

1078
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,319
huge archipelago of tiny little islands

1079
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,509
just off the coast of India and you know

1080
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:46,259
that entire archipelago is expected to

1081
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:50,369
be underwater

1082
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:52,230
within 30 to 50 years so there won't be

1083
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:53,940
anywhere to connect a submarine cable to

1084
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:56,069
because there won't be anywhere to live

1085
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:59,700
you know the the island is one meter

1086
00:41:56,069 --> 00:42:01,890
above sea level that houses the airport

1087
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,980
so the main airport in the maldives will

1088
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,390
will be gone in 20 plus years time

1089
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,559
you're not gonna need a cable anyway

1090
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,180
they exactly you're not gonna you're not

1091
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,549
gonna need a cable if you if you can't

1092
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,839
live there but but it is a good question

1093
00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:14,400
and it is if you're putting in a new

1094
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,660
submarine cable things like that are at

1095
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,609
the forefront where do you actually put

1096
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,049
that dead building that cable landing

1097
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:20,670
station yeah and you put it on the beach

1098
00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:22,319
do you put it a little bit inland you

1099
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:24,210
put it on a hill but there's other

1100
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,740
things as well as people are starting to

1101
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:28,049
look at when you build a landing station

1102
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,430
like physical security you know hard is

1103
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:31,020
it to get into it can you blow it up

1104
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,149
these type of things if you look at

1105
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,309
submarine cables you know about 99% of

1106
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,690
all intercontinental traffic he's

1107
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:38,430
carried over submarine cables as a

1108
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:41,190
business personal use government you

1109
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,660
name it that landing station has to be

1110
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,029
at well protected not just from the

1111
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,710
environment but also from us and we've

1112
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:49,140
moved back from the beach quite a bit

1113
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,730
recently so I think you know used to be

1114
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,129
right on the beach and now we're kind of

1115
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,660
five ten kilometers inland and you know

1116
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,369
that's that's helping with things like

1117
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,578
big inundation floods and things like

1118
00:42:56,369 --> 00:43:01,079
that so I think it's everyone's thinking

1119
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,779
about it because you're always thinking

1120
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:06,119
for 25 a minimum of 25 years service

1121
00:43:03,779 --> 00:43:10,650
life yeah and we had a situation

1122
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:12,510
recently in in Puerto Rico they kara

1123
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:16,619
cane hidden the island as most of you

1124
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:19,500
probably know and the station was built

1125
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:22,559
for category five great but then the

1126
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:25,980
issue was that there was a lot of backup

1127
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,330
water and rising water that started

1128
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,490
and through the marine ducts into the

1129
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:31,590
station so at one point they had to shut

1130
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:33,990
it down right so they went back they

1131
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:36,420
looked at it you know they tried

1132
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,850
identify flaws and we learned from those

1133
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,790
experiences but that that stations been

1134
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:44,100
there for probably 15 20 years without a

1135
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:46,109
promise and boom here's an issue right

1136
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,900
all right the good news is that in the

1137
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:50,369
subsidy is very small and very tight and

1138
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,280
we actually share those types of things

1139
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:55,410
for best practices yeah so that's why we

1140
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,970
move further inland to to lino cable all

1141
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,618
right let's let's see if we can squeeze

1142
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,270
in two quick questions with brief

1143
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,770
answers yes sir

1144
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,230
Highnesses of the name of the new globe

1145
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:06,300
xscape annal really appreciate all that

1146
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,119
all the comments clearly with the

1147
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:11,220
resurgence of the subsea industry from a

1148
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,340
global standpoint of the new cable

1149
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,740
systems coming into into existence and

1150
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,330
being worked on there's there's a

1151
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,339
phenomenon underway where we see that

1152
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,380
data center industry working closely

1153
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,210
with the subsidy industry wanted to land

1154
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,460
more subsea cables in a data center

1155
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:28,650
environment and also for the subsea

1156
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,210
industry to be working more more

1157
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:31,650
hand-in-hand from a data center

1158
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:34,260
perspective to be in carry neutral

1159
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:36,840
colocation sites what what do you think

1160
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,130
as the as a positives of this phenomena

1161
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,900
going forward what do you see as the

1162
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:43,320
challenges and are we doing enough as an

1163
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:45,000
industry a lot of questions

1164
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,190
it's a classic dichotomy though right

1165
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,840
you you have a data center you want to

1166
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:51,300
land two submarine cables I think you've

1167
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:53,280
immediately made your submarine cables

1168
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,960
kind of slightly non resilient because

1169
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,300
they go to the same building you really

1170
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,250
want to be 10 20 kilometers away and

1171
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,109
have quick connectivity so it's it's a

1172
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,550
real you know balancing act in the

1173
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:04,380
design and the engineering of all of

1174
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,450
this that the dichotomy of the two

1175
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,460
things resilience and and common

1176
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:11,399
location to be able to access them so I

1177
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:14,160
I think the industries are working

1178
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,130
together more certainly and people are

1179
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,430
putting forms of data centers at cable

1180
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:23,340
landing stations but it's probably quite

1181
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:25,560
a varied you know inven in this room set

1182
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:30,600
of requirements among people about the

1183
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:32,220
resilience mapping against the varies

1184
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,259
widely depending where you are at which

1185
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,879
region you are right in some cases you

1186
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,730
can land a cable directly into a data

1187
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,510
center in other cases you may not want

1188
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,970
to do that right

1189
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:43,860
reason so you have to look at the pros

1190
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,450
and cons very carefully when you're

1191
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:47,460
designing a new system now if you own

1192
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,689
the whole system like Google then

1193
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,280
they're gonna design it for a data

1194
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:52,560
center today the center cable period

1195
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,720
right but if you want to build a cable

1196
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,850
to serve different parties then you need

1197
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,859
to think of neutral colocation

1198
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:01,350
facilities where are those so that you

1199
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:03,360
can get multiple backhauls multiple

1200
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,870
access capillarity and all that good

1201
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:09,480
stuff so so it varies by region all

1202
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:11,190
right I'm sorry I think that's all the

1203
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,410
time we have we'll probably be out in

1204
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:19,760
the hall if you have more questions but

1205
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:19,759
Brian Eric Nigel thanks very much thanks

1206
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:27,000
guys

1207
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,000
[Applause]

1208
00:46:32,049 --> 00:46:34,109
you
