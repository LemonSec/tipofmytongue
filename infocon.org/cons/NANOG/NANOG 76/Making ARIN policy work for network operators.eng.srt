1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,470
good morning everybody

2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:21,640
so you just heard from John CEO of Aaron

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:23,610
my name is ELISA Moore and I sit on the

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,920
Aaron Advisory Council so I am NOT staff

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:30,130
I'm a member of the Aaron community and

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:34,239
I am elected to their Advisory Council

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:37,030
body which is a group of 15 folks from

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,000
different sections of the community and

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,969
were elected for a three-year term to

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,250
basically Shepherd

11
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,530
community developed community oriented

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,410
policy proposals through the policy

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,910
development process so we come from a

14
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,870
wide variety of different backgrounds

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:58,929
very representative of the community

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,078
some of us work for large ISPs media -

17
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,879
peas small ISPs I personally work for a

18
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,520
top-level domain operator there's

19
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:09,190
nonprofits representation for profit

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,800
representation university networks

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,890
government network so the whole gamut of

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,649
different kinds of network operators

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,039
representing network operators policy

24
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:26,619
and the wider Internet community policy

25
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:28,239
needs to the Aaron community so I'm here

26
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:31,030
as a representative of them of the

27
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:34,330
community talking about recent policy

28
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,160
developments in my day job some of the

29
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,630
other hats that I wear and so I

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,539
mentioned I work for a top-level domain

31
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,958
operator I work for the CA top-level

32
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:46,599
domain contrary to popular belief that

33
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:50,679
does not mean California it means Canada

34
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:53,979
we are the TLD for Canada so sorry

35
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:56,890
Californians you have to be Canadian or

36
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:58,660
have Canadian residency or be a member

37
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,690
of the royal family so if there are any

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:04,959
Royals in here you can also have a

39
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,628
dossier I come and talk to me so that is

40
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,360
my other hat and then I wear a couple of

41
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:13,209
others so I also sit on the Canada

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,830
chapter of the Internet Society in

43
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,710
Canada and

44
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:22,090
the Montreal internet exchange Board of

45
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:25,720
Directors so that is my hi hello this is

46
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,850
me and why I'm why I'm here is to talk

47
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,770
about recent policy developments

48
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:36,430
so as you hopefully know Aaron exhausted

49
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:39,610
their ipv4 free pool of addresses back

50
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:45,150
in 2015 so we're coming up on four years

51
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:49,750
since exhaustion and so the policy

52
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:54,720
proposal queue has has changed as a

53
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:58,660
result of that so there there are more

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,960
policies around the transfer market so

55
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,140
hopefully you know since you can't get

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:08,140
ipv4 from the free pool at Aaron anymore

57
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:12,609
there's a secondary transfer market and

58
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:15,220
third parties who broker or facilitate

59
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,630
these types of transactions to move v4

60
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,150
from a network where maybe it's not

61
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,820
being used to one where it can be used

62
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,870
and so there are a bunch of policies

63
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,780
around how that happens

64
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,920
Aaron oversees those transactions to

65
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:33,880
make sure that they follow policy and

66
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:37,958
yeah there's also a lot of database

67
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:40,120
cleanup efforts in the pipeline so Aaron

68
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,630
is a registry and the registry is not

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,970
very good if it's not very accurate and

70
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:49,380
so where the Aaron and and the wider

71
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:53,620
policy community is really focused on

72
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:56,859
getting those getting the registry to be

73
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,770
more accurate with better data and I'll

74
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,260
talk a bit about that later in addition

75
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,489
to of course ipv6 and getting that and

76
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,070
deployed out there on your networks

77
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,530
which John just talked about so please

78
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,910
go and do your case studies go talk to

79
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,550
the help desk and they'll help you with

80
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:17,519
that I know I should probably do one for

81
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,519
for our network yeah

82
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:25,580
so I'm not trying to get specific policy

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,248
feedback on the specific language of any

84
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,740
given policy I don't want to gather

85
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:33,499
support for any specific policy that's

86
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,860
not what I am here to do today however

87
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:38,960
if you are interested please chime in on

88
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,289
the public policy mailing list if you're

89
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,090
not already subscribed and you can go to

90
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:47,120
the Arin website I think it's under the

91
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:50,210
participates menu and get yourself

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,529
subscribed to that mailing list it's

93
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:58,460
pretty spicy lately so kind of some fun

94
00:04:54,529 --> 00:05:00,710
conversations going on right now what

95
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,650
did you want to know is whether the

96
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,739
general concepts that we're working on

97
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:10,008
and in the policy world are desired by

98
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,259
the operator community whether they are

99
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,539
not and they unduly impact you in any

100
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:17,419
way we need to know who may be your

101
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:19,639
there's something happening in your

102
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:23,659
network or your particular community

103
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,830
that has just we've completely missed so

104
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:27,409
that's why we're doing this outreach

105
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,818
here today is to make as many people

106
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:32,389
aware of it as possible and get your

107
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:38,659
feedback on those things so yeah this is

108
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:41,509
a new way of soliciting that feedback so

109
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:45,409
quickly and I'm gonna talk a little bit

110
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:50,089
about the Arin advisory councils policy

111
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:53,149
response to some recent news a recent

112
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:57,349
case of address fraud related to the

113
00:05:53,149 --> 00:06:00,740
ipv4 waiting list and then I want to go

114
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:03,529
through a few newly implemented policies

115
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,139
and how they might affect a network

116
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,120
operators as well as some that are in

117
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:10,490
the pipeline and could affect you that

118
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,039
you can still weigh in on and have your

119
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,800
voice cards and I'm going to quickly go

120
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,810
through the database cleanup efforts and

121
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,289
then hopefully open it up for a bit of

122
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,289
discussion

123
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:33,008
oh wait

124
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:37,258
all right so in the news recently you

125
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:42,120
may have heard that there was a case of

126
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:45,669
large-scale fraud related to obtaining

127
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,280
ipv4 resources from Aaron's waiting list

128
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,870
if you haven't heard about it again

129
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,729
there's lots of discussion on Aaron's

130
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,240
public policy mailing list there's a

131
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:59,318
Krebbs article and a circle idea article

132
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,849
but essentially a company meek fo

133
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,409
microphone never actually said that out

134
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:05,880
loud I don't know how it's pronounced

135
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:10,960
and created a series of shelf companies

136
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:15,550
to obtain resources from this waiting

137
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:19,318
list and provided Aaron with a whole

138
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:22,060
bunch of false documentation including

139
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:25,780
falsely notarized officer attestations

140
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,090
in order to obtain blocks of v4 from

141
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,179
this waiting list and so this was

142
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:34,359
discovered by Aaron through their due

143
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:38,259
diligence processes and it was basically

144
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,930
discovered that this this company had

145
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:44,020
amassed somewhere on the order of seven

146
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:47,199
hundred and thirty some one thousand I P

147
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,210
addresses and if you pay attention to

148
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,210
the transfer market at all depending on

149
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,060
who you ask an IP address and ipv4

150
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,840
address is worth anywhere between

151
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,110
fifteen and twenty-five dollars

152
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,099
depending on the size of block that

153
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,590
you're you're buying so that's that's

154
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:09,159
quite a large chunk of change that this

155
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:12,638
party was able to or attempted to

156
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:15,759
defraud the internet community of so

157
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,539
Aaron discovered this and house has

158
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,400
worked with law enforcement and

159
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:26,180
basically this this party

160
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,409
is now charged with 20 counts of wire

161
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:33,830
fraud so this is the first such case

162
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:38,180
first case in North America for sure so

163
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:40,940
kind of a watershed moment for the IP

164
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:47,089
address world and a little bit of spicy

165
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:49,430
news for everyone so back in January

166
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:53,510
after this was discovered the board of

167
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:55,430
trustees at Aaron's suspended so it was

168
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,970
discovered before January but in January

169
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:02,719
the Board of Trustees suspended the

170
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:06,410
waiting list and deferred to the

171
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,750
Advisory Council for a policy response

172
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,660
so how can we prevent this from

173
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,810
happening in the future we don't want

174
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,770
this to happen again how can we work on

175
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,329
policy to prevent it from happening so

176
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:22,790
the Advisory Council has made a

177
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,350
recommendation it's now out there on the

178
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,670
public policy mailing list for

179
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,140
discussion and our response was

180
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:34,819
basically if you're gonna put yourself

181
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:38,810
on the ipv4 waiting list which exists

182
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,760
for any dredges of v4 that come back to

183
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,819
Aaron and they do come back to Aaron

184
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,910
either because they've been revoked

185
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:49,220
usually for non-payment or any other

186
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,939
kind of contraventions of the the

187
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:56,270
registry services agreement or because a

188
00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:00,529
party hasn't been following policy which

189
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:02,449
is rare as I understand it but they also

190
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:05,209
come back because people say I don't

191
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,430
want this v4 anymore they just give it

192
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,380
back to Aaron and Aaron says you know

193
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,010
you can sell the rights to use this

194
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,600
right and they go yes but I don't want

195
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,550
to deal with it so they give it back to

196
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:21,080
Aaron and resources do come back that

197
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:23,089
way so the policy response to that was

198
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,650
to create this waiting list to make sure

199
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,450
that they get distributed those

200
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:30,279
resources get distributed back out to

201
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:32,990
network operators so you can use them so

202
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,610
we still want this waiting list we still

203
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,250
want to be

204
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,600
able to distribute those resources but

205
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,579
we've put some stricter parameters

206
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,180
around how that would work so there

207
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:45,170
would be a limit of a slash 22 if you're

208
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,349
coming to the waiting list you can only

209
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,060
get a slash 22 is our recommendation an

210
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,370
organization may not be added to the

211
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,699
waiting list if it already holds in

212
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,200
aggregate more than a slash 20 and there

213
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,820
would be a 60 month

214
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,950
hold period so you would have to hold on

215
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,779
to anything obtained from the waiting

216
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:09,950
list for a period of five years you can

217
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:13,430
just turn around and sell it after a

218
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:15,860
year like the the party who was

219
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:20,569
defrauding or attempting to defraud

220
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:25,269
Aaron did so hopefully those parameters

221
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:29,480
would with limits and those kinds of

222
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:32,870
unlawful actions so in effect the

223
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,940
waiting lists be limited to pretty small

224
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,120
network operators and new entrants or

225
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,959
newcomers to the space so that is a

226
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,850
change if you're a larger organization

227
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,849
who is hoping to get themselves on the

228
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:50,000
waiting list that would no longer be

229
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:53,120
possible under this policy so this this

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,320
does change things for folks wanting to

231
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,089
get on the waiting list and it's under

232
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,550
discussion right now on PP ml you can

233
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:07,220
still weigh in I believe for a couple of

234
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:11,180
days so now I'm going to go through a

235
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,519
couple of recently implemented policies

236
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,479
that could have effect an effect or be

237
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,130
of interest to you for your network

238
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:22,519
operations so so far in 2019 we have

239
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:26,779
implemented a couple of policies so the

240
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:30,380
first one allows for inter-regional AAS

241
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:33,170
and transfers so this will be of

242
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:37,160
interest to anyone looking to obtain a

243
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:39,199
2-byte ASN or who works for a network

244
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,680
operator who does any kind of merger and

245
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:45,920
acquisition activity on an international

246
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,500
basis but basically there was a desire

247
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,390
to be able to transfer

248
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,490
MASN between our IRS with reciprocal

249
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,640
transfer policies so right now this is

250
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,400
ripe and a peanut has reciprocal

251
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:02,540
transfer policies with that and this is

252
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:06,579
largely due to a lack of two byte SNS in

253
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:09,709
the free pool those are exhausted and

254
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:14,600
that's of interest to operators who use

255
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:16,430
large BGP communities so yes there's

256
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,620
been an update that you can use for byte

257
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:25,880
ASNs but that was only implemented 2017

258
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:29,690
RFC 1892 and the the hardware and

259
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,280
software details have not been totally

260
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,800
worked out kinks haven't been totally

261
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,470
worked out so there's still an appetite

262
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,410
for to buy a SNS to make large BGP

263
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,180
communities work so to be able to

264
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,589
internationally transfer those those a

265
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:50,270
SNS was a policy proposal that someone

266
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:53,330
put in and it's it's now passed the next

267
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:55,640
one is removing real reallocation

268
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,710
requirements for residential market

269
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,790
assignments so this is a bit of a

270
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:06,530
cleaning up tidying up house type of

271
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:08,390
policy so there was a policy on the

272
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:12,500
books that was basically a vestige of

273
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:15,650
old cable network requirements that

274
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,960
required like a slash 24 for for every

275
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:20,870
neighborhood even if there were only ten

276
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:25,850
houses in that neighborhood to to

277
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:29,780
demonstrate use of your v4 to Airmen you

278
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:33,080
had to say hey I've I've put these ipv4

279
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:36,410
addresses into use in this network and

280
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,330
can I please have more Wilson's Erin no

281
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:42,770
longer has anymore and you don't have to

282
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:49,190
justify your need for v4 to Aaron to to

283
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:51,470
have to do a detailed reallocation to

284
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,960
justify it to Aaron is no longer a

285
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,750
requirement for residential customers so

286
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,330
if you're a cable network and you have

287
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,950
you do residential reallocations

288
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,170
you're going to want to look into this

289
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:07,470
it might break some of your tooling or

290
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:11,910
automation associated with those types

291
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:19,740
of reallocations so come and talk to me

292
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:22,680
if that is the case for you we also have

293
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,810
a few proposals under discussion

294
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,579
currently that you can still jump in on

295
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,719
the public policy mailing list that

296
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:32,969
could have an effect on your operations

297
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,200
so the first one is to allow

298
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,850
inter-regional transfers of ipv6

299
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,649
resources so this is a bit of a

300
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,959
controversial one on the mailing list

301
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:46,170
right now the problem statement for this

302
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,890
one is that there is operational need to

303
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:52,110
allow rir transfers of ipv6 resources

304
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:56,010
between our ARS with an equivalent

305
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:58,649
transfer policy Erin's rpki trust anchor

306
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:01,200
is measurably less widely deployed than

307
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:05,070
trust anchors from other our ARS as a

308
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:08,310
consequence our PKI Roiz published

309
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,230
through Arin offer less value operators

310
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,869
seeking to extract the most value from

311
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,910
their investment in ipv6 would benefit

312
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,010
from the ability to transfer v6

313
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,520
resources to our IRS with more widely

314
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:24,029
deployed rpki trust anchors so that's a

315
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:27,600
controversial problem statement in and

316
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:29,610
of itself so please chime in on the

317
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,160
public policy mailing list to let us

318
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,470
know whether you agree with this policy

319
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,640
proposal whether there is indeed a need

320
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:42,360
to transfer ipv6 resources and have your

321
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:49,290
voice heard and then we also have a

322
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:52,500
bundle of of proposals related to sort

323
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:56,269
of merger and acquisition activity on an

324
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:59,480
international basis and so these three

325
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:03,510
here are pretty closely interrelated so

326
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:07,150
if you operate an international network

327
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:09,550
you may want to take a look at

328
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:16,089
those those policy proposals especially

329
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:19,448
if you do M&A activity okay so next I

330
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:23,708
want to talk about all of the bad data

331
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:26,410
in the registry and there is a lot and

332
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:34,420
it's not a very good state of affairs

333
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:36,070
guys so 35% of points of contacts are

334
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,110
not validated sorry and this that this

335
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,570
data is from January but I'm assured

336
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:43,840
that it is still quite accurate it's

337
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:47,800
it's still quite up to date so 35% of

338
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:54,459
points of contact are not validated only

339
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:56,440
23% are and 42% are orphaned and I can

340
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:01,240
explain what what orphaned means in just

341
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:06,010
a second here but this is a result of a

342
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:09,250
variety of bad practices like just bad

343
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:12,610
scraping of customer customer order

344
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:15,460
forms that gets automated into into

345
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:19,570
points of contact a lot of this is based

346
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:23,650
on on faults and automation so we are

347
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:27,120
imploring folks who use those tools to -

348
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,530
please take a look at them update them

349
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,219
because it's resulting in some pretty

350
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:37,480
crappy numbers here and another cause of

351
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:41,520
bad data is like just entering nobody at

352
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:44,890
nobody com come on that we can't do that

353
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,010
it's result in really bad data nobody at

354
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:52,210
nobody intercom is not a person as well

355
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:55,390
as things that are like super bad the

356
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,720
covert ipv4 transfers or transfers of

357
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:01,570
resources that should not be happening

358
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,240
at all so we're really looking to clean

359
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,659
up the registry to improve this state of

360
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,830
affairs because good data is is super

361
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:14,140
important it contributes to Internet

362
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,260
operability if something goes wrong if

363
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,660
 hits the fan and you

364
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:20,900
need to get in contact with an operator

365
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:24,610
at another company you want to know who

366
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:28,100
the correct point of contact there is if

367
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:31,340
stuff needs to be fixed on the Internet

368
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,689
so this helps identify and network

369
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,959
operators to each other get the right

370
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:40,330
people in contact to fix things when

371
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:44,660
they go awry the next reason is that

372
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:47,629
still bad data is a target for four

373
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:52,670
hijackers those folks are on the lookout

374
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:54,230
for old shitty data if if stuff hasn't

375
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,200
been updated in a long time that is a

376
00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:00,830
flag that maybe this network is is right

377
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,770
for hijacking and of course Public

378
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:06,590
Safety law enforcement uses this data in

379
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:09,050
their in their investigations like it or

380
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,760
not law enforcement is a member of our

381
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,669
community there are members of the

382
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:17,420
internet community and they use this

383
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:19,460
data for investigation purposes and it

384
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:23,990
ought to be up-to-date to help them do

385
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:27,140
their job and finally it's a contractual

386
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:30,800
requirement of the registration services

387
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:34,820
agreement with Aaron is to keep that

388
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:37,840
data up to date so having bad data is

389
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:40,300
actually a contravention of the

390
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,909
registration services agreement and

391
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,320
finally it's just it's a core mandate of

392
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,440
the regional internet registries to

393
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,480
maintain an accurate database a registry

394
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,610
is not very good if it is is not

395
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,500
accurate it's it's a registry that the

396
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,500
data is supposed to be all in order

397
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:04,340
and so I touched on it a bit earlier but

398
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,800
some of the causes of bad data is the

399
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:11,090
automation the poor tooling the poor

400
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,610
scraping of customer customer forms that

401
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:19,010
are just eating it into into who is into

402
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:21,560
our DAP so that that we need as a

403
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:26,030
community to update our practices in

404
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,190
that regard another one is that simple

405
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,889
reassignments

406
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:33,310
are often sufficient there are a lot of

407
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:36,670
detailed reassignments going into into

408
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:40,419
the database with all kinds of data that

409
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:42,520
is inaccurate when a simple reassignment

410
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,890
which is just I believe the customer

411
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,350
customer name and address would be

412
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:53,920
sufficient so you're not just plugging

413
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:56,110
in and bad data for for the for the sole

414
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,520
purpose of just having it there often

415
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,320
you don't even need to have it there so

416
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,930
depending on the relationship with the

417
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,480
customer and depending on what you're

418
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,550
doing what they're doing with their

419
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,070
block it's often sufficient to just have

420
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:15,570
it as a simple reassignment rather than

421
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:17,139
a detailed record and then then orphaned

422
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,230
orphaned records

423
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:23,350
so there are orphaned organizations and

424
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:26,050
there are orphaned points of contact so

425
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,840
orphaned points of contact are not

426
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:33,639
associated with any number of resources

427
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:36,010
or valid organizations and orphaned

428
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:40,090
organizations are not associated with

429
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:43,090
any number resources so these these are

430
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:46,929
rampant and who is and Aaron is going

431
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:49,209
and threw a pretty big project of

432
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:53,080
cleaning up some of these these orphaned

433
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:55,210
records to get resources out of the

434
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,290
database that aren't associated or sort

435
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,750
of points of contact that aren't

436
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:02,020
associated with any kinds of resource

437
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:04,090
resources out of there and then of

438
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,810
course I touched on earlier the black

439
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,250
market

440
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:11,700
covert transfers just don't it's no no

441
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,700
please don't

442
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,260
and right now there are a few more

443
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,530
policy proposals related to improving

444
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:26,110
Whois accuracy and so one of them on the

445
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:29,440
docket is to disallow third-party

446
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:34,800
organization record creation so this

447
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:39,790
would prevent orgs from creating

448
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:42,310
third-party records so if a man is pure

449
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,240
content delivery network or whatever and

450
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:47,050
I have customers

451
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,860
I can't just create a record for them

452
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:53,320
with out their knowledge record creation

453
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,570
has to involve the knowledge and consent

454
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,770
of the organization the point of contact

455
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:01,629
that that record would be created for so

456
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:04,810
this one is pretty far along in the

457
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,280
policy process it's still up for

458
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,700
discussion you can look at some of the

459
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,920
history of the discussion on this one

460
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:16,450
but this would also hopefully contribute

461
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:18,610
to some more accurate registry data the

462
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,810
operational impact is that it could

463
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:25,629
affect some of your tooling so if you

464
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:27,610
have automation in place that is

465
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,600
automatically creating third-party

466
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:34,149
records from customer order forms and

467
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,760
this is not gonna work for you you're

468
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:41,370
gonna have to change some of that

469
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:46,750
tooling the next one is to clarify

470
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:48,820
reassignment requirements so this policy

471
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:52,120
proposal is is basically just to clarify

472
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:57,399
when a simple reassignment versus a

473
00:24:52,120 --> 00:25:00,129
detailed reassignment is required so if

474
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,070
in your organization in your network you

475
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,960
are you have tooling in place that

476
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:07,419
automatically creates detailed

477
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,050
reassignments when they could just be

478
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:13,200
simple ones and that is something that

479
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:16,750
you're going to want to look into and

480
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,810
finally there's another policy proposal

481
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:21,840
on the docket under discussion that

482
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:26,230
would have

483
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:29,320
validation of an impious contact two

484
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:32,440
times per year that's this also under

485
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:35,230
discussion the proposer of this policy

486
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,600
didn't feel that the current validation

487
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:41,190
process was sufficient so they have

488
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:45,600
proposed an even more heavy-handed

489
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,600
validation process for abuse contacts

490
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,000
and now I'm just going to walk you

491
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:57,580
through sort of the new and improved

492
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,680
validation procedures for points of

493
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:06,310
contact that Aaron goes through so every

494
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:09,700
year Aaron sends an email two points of

495
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:12,700
contact to notify them like hey it's

496
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:16,030
your annual validation time please

497
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:20,380
update or confirm that we still have

498
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:23,129
valid data for your pox so this is for

499
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:27,010
admin tech knock and abuse contacts and

500
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:30,460
after Aaron sends that email out each

501
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:34,240
point of contact has up to 60 days to

502
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:35,830
either confirm or correct their data and

503
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,230
there's a variety of ways you can do

504
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:42,010
this you can click on the link you can

505
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:44,260
send an email that says correct or you

506
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:50,260
can log into your Aaron online accounts

507
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:53,410
and validate or update your data and

508
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:56,430
then if after careful analysis Aaron

509
00:26:53,410 --> 00:27:01,810
deems a point of contact to be abandoned

510
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:03,970
they will be marked invalid in who is so

511
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,250
if your point of contact is marked

512
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,250
invalid you haven't validated your

513
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:12,670
contact and you've been marked invalid

514
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:15,160
then you lose the ability to do a few

515
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,990
things and Aaron online you lose the

516
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:22,120
ability to make changes to your

517
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:25,450
resources in Aaron online until you you

518
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,030
update at least the admin or tech point

519
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:29,460
of contact and

520
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,350
that the information is correct so the

521
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,420
only thing that you can do are make

522
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:40,949
payments or update those contacts until

523
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:42,870
until it is validated and here's just a

524
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,710
screenshot of what that validation

525
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:49,679
email looks like so highlighted I have

526
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:51,540
all of the places where you can like I

527
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:55,670
said respond correct in the subject line

528
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:58,560
and open the the URL in your browser or

529
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:08,790
go into era Nam and do everything in

530
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:09,870
there so I talked a bit about this or no

531
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,940
maybe I didn't talk about this one yet

532
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:14,179
so point of contact notification and

533
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:18,390
validation upon reassignment or

534
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:21,000
reallocation so this policy proposal is

535
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:23,070
currently recommended to the board for

536
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,620
adoption I believe they're meeting next

537
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:29,040
week and if they like the proposal it

538
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:37,379
will become policy and so this would

539
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:40,889
prevent circumstances where where when a

540
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:44,790
network operator makes a reallocation or

541
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:47,090
a detailed reassignment whomever is the

542
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:52,250
recipient of that reassignment or

543
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:55,709
reallocation is going to be notified and

544
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:58,800
they have to to validate their point of

545
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:04,310
contact before it will go into the Whois

546
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,310
database yeah

547
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:14,170
so I want to open it up for a little bit

548
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:16,360
of discussion and so just do a quick

549
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:20,230
recap and then if you have any input on

550
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:24,010
any of the concepts or questions about

551
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:26,410
any of the policy proposals or comments

552
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,450
this is the time for it I will take your

553
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:32,530
feedback back to the Arin Advisory

554
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:34,990
Council but yeah just as a recap if you

555
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:39,160
use automated tooling to create

556
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:41,050
reallocations or reassignment our new

557
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,650
point of contact validation procedures

558
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:48,790
might affect this this automation so

559
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:50,440
please look into it recent policy

560
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:53,620
changes are going to affect who is

561
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:57,700
eligible to get ipv4 resources from the

562
00:29:53,620 --> 00:30:03,179
wait list new proposals may change

563
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:07,720
operators ability to move resources

564
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:09,430
between between our IRS and policy

565
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,930
cleanup efforts are designed to make

566
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:17,170
life easier for you so I will open it up

567
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:20,500

568
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:26,380
