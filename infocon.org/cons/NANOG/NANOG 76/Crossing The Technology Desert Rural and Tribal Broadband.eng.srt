2
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:27,960
how's everybody doing we awake still

3
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,009
I know lunch is coming up so I'll take

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,980
as long as I can

5
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:33,690
no just kidding so let me introduce

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,360
myself because I only recognize a couple

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,989
faces in here Matt Rand Tannen

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,860
I am partnering in business development

9
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,440
for Arcadian infra comm and I've spent

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,330
the last 19 years in Southern California

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,040
working with 20 federally recognized

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,239
tribes as a director of technology

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:57,320
building high-speed wireless microwave

14
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:00,330
supporting library schools head starts

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,239
kids on the ground people in their homes

16
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,239
and continue to work with them on a

17
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:13,290
ongoing basis in policy and in things

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,539
across the United States as it says

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,130
there it's kind of hard to read but I'm

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,410
also the co-chair of the National

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,789
Congress of American Indians tech and

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,030
telecom subcommittee where all the

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,070
policy sort of generates from in Indian

24
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,230
country there's 260 member tribes there

25
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,479
and if there's issues on the ground we

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:36,150
develop policy into resolution it's

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,479
passed by 360 tribes it moves on to the

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,100
hill in DC and and it were you know

29
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,340
through the FCC in different places like

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,710
that I'm the former chairman of the

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,070
board of Native public media to terms

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,240
and I'm currently the vice chair there I

33
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,830
sit on the board of American Indian

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,679
Policy Institute at Arizona State

35
00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:00,990
University and I advise the Western

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,570
Governors Association on the tribal and

37
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,539
rural broadband as well it's actually

38
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:11,459
where I just came from I was in Vail

39
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:13,909
yesterday speaking with them and a few

40
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:18,170
other things I advised the broadband the

41
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:20,548
California broadband council on

42
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,249
essentially everything to do with tribal

43
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:25,040
and some rural broadband aspects that

44
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:27,109
are in the state of California

45
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,548
we helped their first responders network

46
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:32,060
as well as their office of emergency

47
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:33,590
services and I'm sure I'm forgetting

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,239
another thing but that kind of gives you

49
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,170
a little bit of background on me I'm

50
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:42,260
Cree from Alberta Area Canada family's

51
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,018
been in the u.s. 424 years I also impart

52
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,370
Viking and finish as my last name says

53
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:54,260
so got a weird variety there but

54
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:57,139
northern warrior type so we'll go over

55
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:01,220
some of this stuff today I'll try to

56
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:03,579
keep it fun there's quite a few topics

57
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,139
to talk about when we're crossing the

58
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:08,090
communication deserts most of the

59
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:12,079
corporations and even the governments

60
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:15,769
look at communication deserts as off the

61
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:17,870
United States continent and they tend to

62
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:22,069
do work off the United States continent

63
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,439
trying to solve these problems where in

64
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,719
the last 10 years a lot of the tribal

65
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,489
folks myself included have really tried

66
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,948
to focus the US government and some of

67
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,079
the bigger corporations inward towards

68
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:35,540
the United States a reservation system

69
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,669
as well as some of the the most rural

70
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,290
settings in the u.s. because we have

71
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:42,439
those same communication technology

72
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,448
deserts here they're just overlooking

73
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,430
that fact and they're moving off

74
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:48,109
offshore to do demonstration projects

75
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,620
when we could do a lot of demonstration

76
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:57,470
projects right in our own backyard so

77
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,129
rural connectivity so I'm not sure where

78
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,709
you're from

79
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:02,478
that'd take a while to figure out but if

80
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,150
you've driven across the US and you've

81
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,829
ended up in a rural spot where you

82
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,489
looked all the way around you and you

83
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:11,840
couldn't find any people you probably

84
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:17,358
didn't have cell service if you weren't

85
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,789
on a major US Highway so I'm sure then

86
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,620
if you turned off on the side road from

87
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:24,680
the road you were on and and started to

88
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,349
find rural housing you would realize how

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,940
much they didn't have access to the

90
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:31,820
thing that we play with all day long and

91
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:34,330
our networks and and that is access to

92
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,349
broadband and access to communications

93
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,198
so

94
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:42,169
the Royal US has has a big issue with

95
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,899
with lack of connectivity and if you

96
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:46,818
look you know an average rural income is

97
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:50,389
52,000 per household

98
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:53,110
that's not per person so there's a need

99
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,430
for work I would assume there is

100
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,990
probably a need for some funding to be

101
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,819
able to pay for something like broadband

102
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,349
to come to their house and then as well

103
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:04,849
computer equipment and things to be able

104
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:07,490
to use it just like tribal which I'll

105
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:10,219
jump across which is it's basically very

106
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,110
similar because the tribes are all in

107
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:13,459
rural America except for those random

108
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,259
tribes that happen to be in Palm Springs

109
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:19,819
or you know adjacent to a major city

110
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:23,330
they're they're all in rural settings

111
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,439
and there's 573 federally recognized

112
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,180
tribes spread out through yeah

113
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:32,770
throughout the United States the lower

114
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:35,539
48 has right around 325 reservations and

115
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:39,020
that at the top bullet point they're

116
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:42,188
8,000 miles of middle mile fiber is

117
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,589
missing to connect those reservations

118
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:47,029
and I know that because during the last

119
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:51,769
administration I was working with the

120
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:53,990
CTO of the US and we were identifying

121
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:55,969
why tribes had such a hard time a

122
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,099
barrier to entry to getting access to

123
00:05:55,969 --> 00:06:00,889
just the basic fiber it would need to

124
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:05,089
backhaul to the rest of the network so

125
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:07,069
we worked with a lot of the the carriers

126
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:08,479
in the United States and got although

127
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,369
their mapping and laid it over the

128
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,990
reservation system and we were able to

129
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,669
identify that there are truly eight

130
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,680
thousand middle mile fibers missing in

131
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,849
this component so even if they were to

132
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,769
have a network internal to their

133
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:20,719
reservation they don't have any way to

134
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:24,099
transport out right so they're very

135
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:26,180
reliant upon microwave in this situation

136
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,789
fiber infrastructure is hard to build

137
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,219
especially hard for tribes to build when

138
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,839
it's not on their tribal land when

139
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:35,930
they're having to navigate county land

140
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,699
to get services to them return on

141
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,089
investments not there for a carrier to

142
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:44,379
build it not enough bodies biggest

143
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:46,849
reservations Navajo in the lower 48 and

144
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,970
there's 300,000 enrolled members but

145
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:51,420
they only have about 131

146
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:54,220
members that live on the reservation so

147
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,010
it's still not enough enough people and

148
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,230
it's way spread out to be able to return

149
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:01,180
investment on this on the design of how

150
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,780
they need to recover costs for

151
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,060
infrastructure and if you see there

152
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,729
there's there's also a lot of situations

153
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,530
where there's no cell service and thirty

154
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,870
thirty percent of the travel tribal

155
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,429
households don't have plain old

156
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,280
telephone service so can't dial

157
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,460
nine-one-one from the house so the real

158
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,380
problem in the rural rural communities

159
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,780
as well as the tribal communities and

160
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:29,409
getting this and we've seen rates up to

161
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:32,260
$1,000 a megabit still I mean I remember

162
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:35,710
when t1 was 1200 I make you know one

163
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:37,930
point five this was from about 20 years

164
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,280
ago and then it should have come down

165
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,280
but we're still seeing some thousand

166
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,919
dollar price tags today per Meg so it's

167
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:49,840
kind of cost prohibitive to get involved

168
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,460
so tribes are very dependent on

169
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,229
microwave this is a picture of a tower

170
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,130
from the tribal digital village network

171
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,750
in Southern California and you can see

172
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,230
the terrain the green valley that's

173
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,570
beyond the the tower in the picture is

174
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,060
where the reservation is where the

175
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:10,440
people live the tower is up on the

176
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,490
mountaintop geography is very diverse

177
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,010
building fiber through systems like that

178
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,750
is very tough hanging on poles sounds

179
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,730
like a great idea until you remember

180
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,860
Southern California burns down every

181
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:25,390
year if you haven't seen the news so

182
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,790
luckily Wireless doesn't burn down as

183
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,919
often and the firefighters tend to know

184
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,540
where these sit so when they're

185
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,309
threatened they know who provides that

186
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,469
internet so they typically bomb that

187
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:37,959
with the red stuff that keeps them alive

188
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,310
that one's been painted red before we

189
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,110
actually went up to take care of it

190
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:44,619
afterwards and clear off our solar

191
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,990
panels and we found it washed we're like

192
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,339
whoa and they in their spare time they

193
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,110
had washed it back off because they

194
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:55,240
wanted the Internet pretty cool you know

195
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,740
they're probably on Amazon or something

196
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,790
you know buying stuff for the station so

197
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,890
microwave tends to be a stopgap

198
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,810
a lot of times for a fiber solution in

199
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,000
these kind of situations where tribes

200
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,890
have gotten fairly good access to e-rate

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,210
and things like that to get funding to

202
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,490
bring middle mile fiber onto the

203
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:16,670
reservation it takes a long time

204
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,260
right fiber builds take time so to build

205
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,770
out something so that the people can use

206
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,960
it right away

207
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,270
microwave tends to step in the step into

208
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,830
the picture at that point it solves a

209
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:30,920
lot of geographically diverse problems

210
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:35,590
and for the bottom point there the the

211
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:40,069
tribal historic aspect so tribes have

212
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:41,660
sort of a history of not being able to

213
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,950
track some of their artifacts and things

214
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,170
because they were moved around so much

215
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,700
by the United States government so they

216
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,079
have a real tough time and then and then

217
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,940
when they did track stuff people then

218
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,730
took that information that they recorded

219
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,200
and destroyed it so they don't have a

220
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,930
lot of record where some of this stuff

221
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,490
is and they're very sensitive about you

222
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,859
trenching across the middle of the

223
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,530
reservation because could be a gravesite

224
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,560
could be you know historical sacred site

225
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,209
of any measure and then it could be just

226
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,010
artifacts that they would want to save

227
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,930
if they were to come run into so there's

228
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,060
a little tough situation there and so

229
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,010
other companies moving in across

230
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,400
reservation have to be sensitive to

231
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,720
those things and typically you run into

232
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,470
companies that aren't that sensitive

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:30,320
when it comes to that stuff and example

234
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:32,750
a twenty years ago everybody built the

235
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,150
fiber network to go as fast as they

236
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:39,770
could go east-west and a couple of

237
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:42,860
north-south to get money there the

238
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:45,800
business model was dollars per linear

239
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,810
foot of fiber in the ground right so

240
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,339
every mile they built they got more

241
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,959
money they got more money so the faster

242
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,340
they built across the u.s. the more

243
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,310
money they got the higher the value of

244
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:57,380
their company and they built huge

245
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,880
networks but they avoided everything

246
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,800
that was slowing down across the way

247
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,420
right what gets in the way Grand

248
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,010
Canyon's in the wait or go around the

249
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,969
Grand Canyon what's this Rocky Mountains

250
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,100
go around that River

251
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,630
what's this Indian Reservation we don't

252
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,700
how to deal with that let's go around

253
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,830
those let's skip all of them they look

254
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,840
like trouble and keep moving

255
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,520
also tribes because of the relationships

256
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,680
they've had with the carriers in the

257
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,930
past wanting to just use eminent domain

258
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,910
or some sort of easement blast through

259
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,010
your reservation they have a you know

260
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,150
weird sorted past with these people so

261
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,450
they kind of feel like they're bullies

262
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:32,400
so they typically throw up things like a

263
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,470
price tag of a million dollars of mile

264
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,380
for rights right away on the reservation

265
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,020
which is really a sign of you know don't

266
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,090
talk to me anymore go away so we've seen

267
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,569
a lot of that kind of stuff happen but

268
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:49,080
it created where the red circles are

269
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:52,920
giant communication deserts right so no

270
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,050
connectivity to any value of throughput

271
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:01,110
there to be able to tie it back into the

272
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:05,099
into the system so there's a little bit

273
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:08,280
more of how that came to that so carry

274
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,020
our metrics you know you know how the

275
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,380
carrier's make their money right they

276
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,480
gotta sell products to people and

277
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,430
they've sold us all our products

278
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,100
basically right we all have that

279
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,030
smartphone we all have that computer we

280
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,770
all have that stuff and it's all

281
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:26,699
connected to our system what else are

282
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:28,530
they going to sell us they're looking at

283
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,700
communities in rural communities that

284
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,740
they don't have enough numbers to bring

285
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,880
you know it doesn't even make sense to

286
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,010
even drive out there to find out if

287
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,430
there's enough numbers for them to make

288
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,470
their money so there's there's no way

289
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,630
for them to do anything new like fill in

290
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,510
those communication deserts by building

291
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,220
across that the carriers are there to

292
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,250
leveraged and they're strapped to

293
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,620
business concepts of content provision

294
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,380
now and shifting gears into you know

295
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,480
film production and and becoming a

296
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,360
Content player which are absorbing some

297
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,520
of their free spend dollars and and they

298
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,740
don't have they don't actually have the

299
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,230
money to to build out anymore in

300
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,170
capacity they typically just leased from

301
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,280
everyone so they also have some strained

302
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,990
relationships with the rights away

303
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,110
owners as I said their relationships

304
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:20,270
with the tribes carriers tended used to

305
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:22,350
tend to build with railway as well and I

306
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,199
don't know there's a horrible history

307
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,870
with railroads and tribes

308
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,730
almost how many of you know but at one

309
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,070
point one of the rail companies used

310
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,560
bulldozers to push burial mounds over to

311
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,769
make the raised ground to put the tracks

312
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,920
on so you know there's a little American

313
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:43,579
Horror Story for you so a positive

314
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,349
change in market dynamics right so the

315
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:48,138
content players are now the drivers

316
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:51,019
right everybody is at the top of that

317
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:52,519
content food chain you all know who you

318
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:56,899
are some of you are in the room I see

319
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,880
you you're dictating where the fibers

320
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,579
are gonna go you're also looking for new

321
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,529
fiber paths right I don't want to go

322
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:05,060
down that same old path what if a

323
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:06,800
bulldozer chops that thing in half and

324
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,670
then everybody goes down everybody goes

325
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,250
down because they're all in the same

326
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:15,279
hole so it's time to build new routes

327
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:18,320
it's time to build new opportunities and

328
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,760
it's obviously time to you know build a

329
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,399
bunch of more data centers because data

330
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:28,399
is king at the moment so they're driving

331
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:33,920
not the carriers are driving right so

332
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:37,310
we're looking at situations where how

333
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:41,269
fast can that cat picture propagate from

334
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:42,859
here to Russia and and if there's not

335
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:46,579
enough fiber diversity or there's a

336
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:49,070
faulty path in the system you know that

337
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:52,729
cat picture may not make it to Russia or

338
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,050
to China or to Australia as fast as we

339
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:58,160
want our friends that are over there to

340
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,859
see it so we need to get creative and we

341
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,310
need it we need to build some new paths

342
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:06,170
a new positive change is that tribes are

343
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,609
now understanding the value of broadband

344
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,199
before they were just like no

345
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,120
communication companies don't cross our

346
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,769
reservations we don't want to deal with

347
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,490
you now they're like how do we get

348
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:19,750
broadband because broadband unbeknownst

349
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:24,199
to them is as important now as

350
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:27,560
electricity in water they have a real

351
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:30,649
bad problem with tribal youth actually

352
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:33,290
getting educated coming off reservation

353
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:35,510
to go to university and never coming

354
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,130
home because they could never execute

355
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,459
any of the degrees that they get in the

356
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,819
universe

357
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:42,998
city where they live so they stay away

358
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:46,069
from home so they're losing this massive

359
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:49,119
educated portion of their population and

360
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:52,550
their reservation systems being depleted

361
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:53,569
cultural leaders who used to say no no

362
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,939
no we don't want to internet for our

363
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:57,378
kids it's we can't police it can't make

364
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:58,819
sure they're not unformed we can't make

365
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:00,649
sure they're not gambling and we can't

366
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:03,439
make sure of these things we don't know

367
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,329
how to do that are now saying hey Matt

368
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:08,118
how do we how do we bring the Internet

369
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:09,019
in and entice them back home how do we

370
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,790
bring them home because we're losing

371
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,329
some of our cultural leaders that go get

372
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,879
educated

373
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:17,029
we can't even continue our cultural

374
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,769
stuff without those kids staying home so

375
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:20,420
there's a big shift there and it's I

376
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,579
think it's a positive shift and there's

377
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,248
a big component of how to manage your

378
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:28,008
digital footprint which we're helping in

379
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:30,050
the process with tribes to understand

380
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:36,249
like how better to use the Internet to

381
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:38,809
be protected so let's see

382
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:41,600
so the first step obviously is the

383
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:42,459
hardest it looks like though that's

384
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,389
awesome

385
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:48,109
so I was wondering if this would happen

386
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:50,839
this this tends to happen on the jumping

387
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,089
between systems that the map has shifted

388
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:57,079
up so Phoenix is at the bottom of that

389
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:59,089
why okay and then the top left goes to

390
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:01,329
Salt Lake City top right goes to Denver

391
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:04,970
which it seems to be landing on Denver

392
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:06,859
the middle of that is no-man's land

393
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,809
because that circle is exist from our

394
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:12,859
previous map there was never anything

395
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:14,928
built there and the left side of that

396
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,849
map like I said before Grand Canyon

397
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:20,299
nobody could get through that and you

398
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:22,099
still can't not legally unless you have

399
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:26,750
Evel Knievel drag a cable over the top

400
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:27,678
no he's dead so if we have we have on

401
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,090
the right side we have the Rocky

402
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,710
Mountains and those are really tough to

403
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,240
build sir and you got a you know you got

404
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,510
about three months a year when it's not

405
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,909
covered in snow and then right down the

406
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,399
middle of that big circle is the Navajo

407
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:42,980
Nation and the Navajo Nation was a

408
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:45,020
million dollars a mile so nobody was

409
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,669
gonna build out in the middle of that so

410
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,460
that left this giant hole in the United

411
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:49,860
States where nobody has access those

412
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,720
130,000 Native

413
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,830
reckons on that reservation there's

414
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,540
probably another hundred and thirty

415
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,490
thousand rural customers that live

416
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,399
adjacent to that reservation in that

417
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,870
area just in the center let alone you

418
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,600
get down towards Phoenix in the rural

419
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,070
setting you're near Flagstaff to the

420
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,469
city all those different places you're

421
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:11,820
actually around a lot of rural customers

422
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:15,299
so this is the first time that someone

423
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,610
is building this kind of a solve for the

424
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:21,840
system so Arcadian infra comm the

425
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:24,689
company I'm doing partnering in business

426
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,668
development for this is our first

427
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,669
announced route so it's going to connect

428
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:32,130
those three major data center cities it

429
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:35,299
is going to bring approximately 300

430
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:38,520
miles of fiber through the Navajo Nation

431
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:42,740
providing them with dark fiber with lit

432
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:47,629
services and with money and it converges

433
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:50,400
three new fiber paths in one place and

434
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,650
the middle of that why where there's

435
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,790
ample water

436
00:18:51,650 --> 00:19:01,200
there's tons of power I'm thinking data

437
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:03,480
center so these are the types of

438
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,710
opportunities that we need to see in the

439
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,520
market and these these are the things

440
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,530
that we need to change as far as the the

441
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,809
demographic what we're looking at we

442
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,549
need to fill up these little they call

443
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,290
them white spaces but now you know

444
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:17,429
everybody's using TV white spaces so

445
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,928
that doesn't really work but

446
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:24,890
communication deserts in the middle of

447
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:27,330
all these voids right so full diversity

448
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,830
right completely new routes go on

449
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,750
different locations still connecting

450
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,220
cities that we already connect but you

451
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,410
don't have to go all the way down here

452
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,250
across the bottom and back up to get

453
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:40,710
there you can actually go straight

454
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:43,080
working with rights-of-way owners that

455
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:47,070
previously weren't interested and now

456
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:50,370
we're very interested the benefit of

457
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:54,659
this type of a build is if you are

458
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,049
building for giant customer a you know

459
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,750
who that is

460
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:59,850
and you're connecting their two data

461
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,100
centers together as long as you hit a

462
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,918
latency that is respect

463
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,899
within their parameters nobody cares if

464
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:11,399
that line goes over to middle America a

465
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:13,049
little town Z reservation one you know

466
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:15,178
and they can scoot around a little bit

467
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:18,120
all the way through your rights away and

468
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,580
connect and leave opportunities access

469
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,620
to that fiber pass all along the route

470
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,840
and open up the rural opportunities for

471
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,250
all the small carriers all the middle

472
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,600
carriers all the tribes that want to

473
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,130
build for themselves little town USA

474
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,289
like a man Idaho I was just in Vail

475
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,510
yesterday and and the direction of the

476
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:38,340
technology director of M and Idaho they

477
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:42,000
have a gigabit service for twenty six

478
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,520
bucks a month each other every home has

479
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,090
access to that name and Idaho twenty six

480
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,070
bucks for a gig symmetrical so these are

481
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:55,168
the opportunities that that will come

482
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:57,960
off of this type of a build so creating

483
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:59,760
new partnerships Department of

484
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,559
Transportation I mean there's a lot of

485
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,840
smart business going on cars these days

486
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:06,470
and pretty soon it's gonna be really

487
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,689
smart because it won't be humans driving

488
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:15,200
obviously we're working townships power

489
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:22,640
providers rural coops and tribal nations

490
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:25,350
so the benefits to the people workers

491
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,950
local workers fiber needs to be

492
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,350
maintained

493
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,940
data centers need to be maintained local

494
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:33,649
jobs and communities that don't normally

495
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:36,539
have a job Center fees for rights-of-way

496
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:38,250
right there's there's funding there for

497
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:40,850
paying for the rights away for some of

498
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:44,190
these organizations some of these tribes

499
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,779
educational impact connecting all the

500
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,429
schools and libraries even if they're

501
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:48,929
already connected connecting them at a

502
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,789
greater capacity so that actually

503
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:54,870
actually can function in what we're

504
00:21:50,789 --> 00:22:00,960
doing today in education distance

505
00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:04,020
learning my kids I lived at last ten

506
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,200
years - the last year without internet

507
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,850
at the house I bought a Verizon modem

508
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,399
plugged it into a cradle point router

509
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:14,158
and I blasted it through my house so my

510
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:14,429
kids could do homework and paid through

511
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,920
the

512
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:20,130
for that surface to make sure the kids

513
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:23,160
could have access but now this distance

514
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,570
learning opportunity is huge right so

515
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,510
they're gonna have access at their house

516
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,500
they're gonna be able to dial into

517
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,800
tutoring services at the local

518
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,200
university get math help get science

519
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,850
help there's actually been some things

520
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,350
done on the reservations where they'll

521
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,879
come out with a biologist and they'll

522
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,370
have a test kit and they'll test the

523
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,810
running water that's in the stream but

524
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,949
they'll put it on the internet so that

525
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,840
the kids that can't be there from

526
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,300
different reservations are able to

527
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,449
participate acts ask questions it's

528
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:57,590
bi-directional really cool stuff so

529
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,820
coding software coding app development

530
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:02,159
you name it it's huge

531
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,710
there's coding camps happening in urban

532
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,880
centers all the time

533
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,200
Native American kids hear about that and

534
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,180
want to want to be part of it they don't

535
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,060
have access some of the smartest kids

536
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:14,070
out there don't have access to coding

537
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:18,419
there's a scary thing happening in

538
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:20,189
artificial intelligence if you are not

539
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,090
involved in the development of the AI

540
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:28,170
brain computer brain you're effectively

541
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:30,689
going to become extinct by that brain at

542
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:33,000
AI right so if Native Americans aren't

543
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,900
contributing to the programming of the

544
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,330
AI then they will effectively not be

545
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,680
visible to the AI in the future because

546
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:44,760
the programmers that are doing it now

547
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,890
aren't aware of the subtle nuances that

548
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,890
make you Native Americans sometimes or

549
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:52,320
the difference is that that you are I'm

550
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,820
different than you in society so some of

551
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,909
those things are kind of scary so

552
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,399
getting tribal kids into coding camps

553
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,690
with our partners you know big

554
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,640
corporations that want to bring a bunch

555
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,290
of kids into coding this is a great

556
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,960
opportunity and when fiber comes into

557
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,700
that space they have every opportunity

558
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:14,100
to be able to do that out on the

559
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:16,140
reservation so social impact is you know

560
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:19,800
I think somewhat obvious everybody will

561
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:22,110
have social media I don't know that not

562
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,399
that social impact it provides

563
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,260
opportunity right it provides

564
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,400
opportunity for education for job search

565
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:31,020
for health it creates better community

566
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,370
more solidified community happier

567
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:38,580
community access to information and I

568
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:41,219
got to say everybody bags on networks

569
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,720
because all you're doing is feeding

570
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,080
Netflix to everybody that's all your

571
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:50,940
network is worth and 82% of our network

572
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,159
in Southern California is Netflix but if

573
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,110
you have to take all the kids and the

574
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,540
parents in the family into the one

575
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:00,209
family vehicle and drive an hour to town

576
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:03,300
and spend over $100 at the movie theater

577
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,700
to be able to get entertained and eat up

578
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:09,060
a four-hour block of your life I'm all

579
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,710
for supporting 82 percent of Netflix

580
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,720
going to rural communities because it

581
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,520
gives people access to entertainment at

582
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,470
their home they don't have to you know

583
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,790
take a risk or spend an exorbitant

584
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,640
amount of money to get out of the

585
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:23,280
reservation just to see a movie finds a

586
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,590
little bit of hope these kids especially

587
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,139
the bigger reservations there's no jobs

588
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,790
there's no opportunities they get passed

589
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,320
high school and then they sit and they

590
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,639
don't know what to do a lot of them

591
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,139
don't have a road out to get higher

592
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,480
education they just don't know where to

593
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:42,210
where to go or what to do and now with

594
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,980
this opportunity coming in they see the

595
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,800
ability to telecommute for Google

596
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:51,000
telecommute for Facebook telecommute for

597
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,950
anybody do product support for Amazon

598
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,750
all kinds of different stuff or just

599
00:25:52,950 --> 00:26:01,740
write really cool reviews so benefits

600
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:05,550
for the partners obviously it's middle

601
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:08,250
mile fiber from the backbone to the last

602
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,629
mile provider so there's a lot of last

603
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,790
mile providers out there that have

604
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,220
really really bad access to the middle

605
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:18,149
mile and it's probably super expensive

606
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,280
this brings a whole new cost structure

607
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:25,800
into that market and allows people to

608
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:28,320
build way more and grow way more fiber

609
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,590
to towers obviously for the last talk 5g

610
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,450
got to have fiber increase the federal

611
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,280
grant program opportunities because

612
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,910
there will be actual access to to

613
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,620
supplement economic development zones so

614
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,610
does that fiber comes in there here

615
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,370
comes the economic

616
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,290
it actually it just just happens we've

617
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,600
seen it in Southern California on the

618
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,790
tribal digital village Network and we'll

619
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,290
see it with Navajo as the fiber gets

620
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:58,340
built out so how do you help again code

621
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:01,080
camps hardware and software donations

622
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,790
refurbs we've got a bunch of firms just

623
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,620
giving up their computer every three

624
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,090
years will give it to us we'll get it

625
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,139
into the Native American community it's

626
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:12,230
that kind of a thing there's programs

627
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:12,230
for that remote entry level jobs

628
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:17,940
personal outreach community outreach

629
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,490
you know big corporations have a

630
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,160
department for this and if you're

631
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:25,500
looking to do this kind of outreach

632
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,080
there's a place in the u.s. right next

633
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,030
to you you know just a 50-minute drive

634
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,010
or an hour-and-a-half drive that it

635
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:34,560
really needs this level of support and

636
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:37,050
would be a great place for you to

637
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,570
support as well as it'll be reciprocal

638
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:41,490
it'll be you'll have y'all have a job

639
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,610
force that's curious and interested

640
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:49,310
about your corporation and that would

641
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,310
end does anybody have any questions

642
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:56,250
what's for lunch is that the first

643
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,139
question yeah one quickie Marysol be

644
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,430
with us ignite what's your funding model

645
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,480
for the current build out that you're

646
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:05,730
talking about so the fiber build-out is

647
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,660
infrastructure fund folks private

648
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:11,550
private yeah it's it's not quick flip

649
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:24,810
Wall Street it's not government

650
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:27,240
it's private funding it's it's a ways

651
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,370
off but so there's a huge dynamic that's

652
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,620
going to change on Navajo and the

653
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:35,790
technical universities are without you

654
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:37,709
know good bandwidth at the moment so NTA

655
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,290
who is our partner on the Navajo Nation

656
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,940
we work with nation and and that's their

657
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:45,960
vehicle to deliver services on the

658
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,770
reservation has been killed in the price

659
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,900
of band

660
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:50,160
they have to pay for so they have to

661
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,960
pass that on the customers

662
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,310
it's a horrible scenario we're gonna

663
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,950
bring in opportunity that will

664
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:59,040
dramatically lower their their cost to

665
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:01,890
entry on everything should just open up

666
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,840
the door for new opportunities for the

667
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,400
technical universities I know that the

668
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,850
technical universities I actually just

669
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,260
spoke at West met and talked to I think

670
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,209
all of the universities that are on

671
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,379
Navajo and we talked about solutions and

672
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,630
opportunities that are gonna change

673
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,580
there so there are they're looking at

674
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,770
different angles to be able to tie in to

675
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,139
this I know that there's a potentially

676
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,700
even a collaboration of carriers right

677
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,340
now that are joining together to build

678
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,170
fiber with one of those universities so

679
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:35,159
things are definitely changing thank you

680
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:38,070
yeah rubs in Jesus I'm two for two on

681
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,350
this Rob ceased from asking question on

682
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:43,500
my own behalf

683
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:45,389
ipv4 addresses are expensive IP carrier

684
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:49,350
grade nat as a constrained resource

685
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:53,910
what's your ipv6 story like that is for

686
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:56,790
the engineer ipv6 there's nothing to be

687
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:59,930
afraid of obviously I mean it's going to

688
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:02,220
be the future is it the future today

689
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:06,570
well this is three years out right this

690
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:08,220
is lid in 2022 so sure that's the future

691
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,540
day I'm going to be 400 gig waves by

692
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,740
then so we should be ipv6 by then right

693
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,260
well I don't know that for sure if but I

694
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,700
can answer I can follow-up we could talk

695
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,500
later but if you're if you're not there

696
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,250

697
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,780

698
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,780
service provider so we're just doing

699
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:34,170
infrastructure it is fiber 100 and 400

700
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:35,490
gig waves that's it all the carriers we

701
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,490
want to leave meat on the bone for them

702
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:41,130
their services they provide will be v4

703
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:44,100
