1
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,360
hello everyone

2
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,990
so I'm actually who in here heard me

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,560
talk about DNS Flag Day in San Francisco

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,240
all right

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,390
that Flag Day has already passed and

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,198
everyone's DNS survived more or less

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,939
yeah okay

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,590
all right if they're members of the

9
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:31,570
press here we're always here in this

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:35,980
room excited that the internet still

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:39,280
functions yeah all right so of course so

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,599
the whole deal with DNS Flag Day in 2019

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,960
and then also the new one that we're

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,049
going to do next year is that the DNS

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,839
protocol is goodness like 35 years old

16
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:54,220
now so we've made a lot of changes over

17
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:57,280
the years to the protocol with mixed

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:00,309
results on how people implement that and

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,580
what I mean by mixed results is very

20
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:06,580
often things like firewalls will not

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,500
implement exactly what the RFC state

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,539
they should implement so this is really

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,410
a lot of that push what what happens in

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:16,420
the DNS world when firewalls or

25
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:19,479
middleware boxes don't do exactly what

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,790
they should by protocol then DNS vendors

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,280
have to sort of work around that and

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,470
ensure that the user still gets the

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,480
answer that they need even though some

30
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,940
boxes in between aren't playing nice in

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:36,460
the protocol okay that's the very

32
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:39,158
high-level overview all right so when I

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,740
say in this talk we this is the we that

34
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:45,159
I'm referring to so when I say the DNS

35
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,960
community in this case these are the

36
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,510
folks that participation that

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,899
participated in this Flag Day so the one

38
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,260
in 2019 was about ensuring that everyone

39
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:59,380
that plays in the DNS protocol

40
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:01,960
implementation space implements properly

41
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,679
a DNS or extension mechanisms for DNS

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:09,519
okay that protocol is 20 years old so

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,159
yay for getting full compliance after 20

44
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,069
years in the Internet that's great

45
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,149
anyway this is pretty to me a

46
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,970
significant moment in internet history

47
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,910
if you will all of these parties came

48
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,080
together and agree

49
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,440
that we were gonna do something about

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,210
this problem again those workarounds

51
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,070
that implementers have to do create

52
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:33,520
problems for you in terms of you know

53
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:36,290
you know possibly more bugs in the code

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,050
more delays so we're trying to make the

55
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,269
DNS ecosystem better by doing this okay

56
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,270
I also want to say that I've been in the

57
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,280
operations community or I've done

58
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,050
operations for most of my professional

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,070
career so I understand the nervousness

60
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:57,830
you get with things like Flag Day and

61
00:02:52,070 --> 00:03:00,170
the the Flag Day name is little I won't

62
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,480
sing misleading but it's a date by which

63
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,299
the implementers are no longer going to

64
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,369
work around brokenness it is not a date

65
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,110
in which your DNS is going to fall off

66
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,020
the earth and you're no longer going to

67
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,290
be visible on the internet okay but the

68
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,060
name actually got us exactly what we

69
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,970
wanted is that people started paying

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,850
attention to this and people that pay

71
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:26,870
people to do their DNS services or pay

72
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:28,549
firewall vendors ask their provider to

73
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,060
ensure that they were compliant with

74
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:35,810
these changes so so that worked out all

75
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,640
right yeah so what do we have now so

76
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,880
we've passed this other we passed the

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:44,209
2019 Flag Day and so you know as good

78
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,100
engineers do things went well so then we

79
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,770
have to do something else right

80
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:52,790
so we started looking at the DNS what is

81
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:54,410
what problems remain the main one that

82
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,660
we're trying to fix with this new flag

83
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,060
day in 2020 and I want to I want to

84
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:03,109
point out that's number one the Flag Day

85
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:05,270
date has not been set yet for 2020 one

86
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,670
of the complaints to us and the DNS

87
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:11,300
community was that we did not properly

88
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:13,040
announce in good fashion the 2019 for

89
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,959
that day so we're trying to get out

90
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,469
ahead of that issue this time around so

91
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:25,580
so anyway there are problems with

92
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:27,979
fragmentation in DNS particularly in the

93
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,530
ipv6 realm how many of you have had

94
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:33,229
equipment that does not honor i p v6

95
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,359
extension headers or

96
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,610
I've had or still have yes okay a couple

97
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,370
of hands okay so anyway this creates

98
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,980
problems in terms particularly for DNS

99
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,590
that if fragmentation isn't handled

100
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,440
properly oftentimes this will cause

101
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,330
problems for the clients now we work

102
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,700
really hard to work around that

103
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,190
so DNS works really hard to try to ask

104
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,690
other servers the same questions if they

105
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,420
don't get the answer that they you know

106
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:02,150
expect or don't get an answer but this

107
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,970
really again creates a lot of delay in

108
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,880
the DNS one thing I want to say very

109
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:11,000
clearly is this 2020 Flag Day does not

110
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,050
mean that DNS is not going to still take

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,120
place primarily over UDP it will still

112
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,490
mostly take place over UDP what we are

113
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,020
saying in 2020 which is the next slide

114
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:26,840
is number one that you have to do if

115
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,849
you're going to do DNS as any kind of

116
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,590
device or application you have to be

117
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,260
able to perform TCP it doesn't mean that

118
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,750
you will always it just means that you

119
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,409
have to be able to fall back to that if

120
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,180
needed if the answer is too large we're

121
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,190
not going to defragment at this point so

122
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,930
we're gonna switch back to TCP or switch

123
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:50,270
to TCP to to ensure we we can talk so

124
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,920
the other so I said that the 2020 Flag

125
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,500
date has not yet been set the other

126
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,150
thing that is not quite set yet is what

127
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,340
we're gonna actually set the e DNS

128
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,359
buffer size to so the extension

129
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,640
mechanisms for DNS allow for up to 4 0 9

130
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,560
6 bytes in the DNS message but again

131
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,630
there is a lot of equipment that can't

132
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,900
handle things and fragmentation starts

133
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,620
to happen right around that 1220 byte

134
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,620
size

135
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,690
so we're thinking somewhere around in

136
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:22,010
there is going to be what we set this to

137
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:23,360
be okay again pointing out firewalls

138
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,940
here my apologies to the firewall

139
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,210
vendors but we're happy to help you try

140
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:32,920
to decipher what the RFC's mean if

141
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:35,840
you're confused we'd love to help okay

142
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,690
let's see here okay so the other thing

143
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,359
we got a lot of feedback on is your

144
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:44,360
website and I want to state a lot of

145
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,680
this please for from the operator

146
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,289
perspective what do you have to

147
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,440
do today the answer is nothing in terms

148
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:53,780
of configuring things so yeah but please

149
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,630
still listen you're out your job is to

150
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:00,380
be aware of this and to go out to the

151
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,150
DNS flagged a net site and on there we

152
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,090
will keep you updated and posted with

153
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:08,659
things like the date and what we set

154
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:12,948
this buffer size to be also on that site

155
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:16,430
is a test tool that the test tool is in

156
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:19,130
progress so we'll be working on that in

157
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,009
the coming weeks you can do manual tests

158
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,469
by firing off these example Digg

159
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,210
commands here and again if you have

160
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,300
contacts at any of the people on that

161
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,799
list of folks that are cooperating in

162
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,120
this and you have problems with your

163
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,729
tests all of us respond to direct emails

164
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,620
sometimes even phone calls about how you

165
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:41,508
can be compliant or what you need to

166
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,590
tell your provider so that your domain

167
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:47,630
can be compliant ok so that's what I

168
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,810
just said please go to the DNS Flag Day

169
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:54,409
site you can also follow DNS flag day on

170
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,449
Twitter for you youngsters yeah and then

171
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:58,820
talk to us at different places and again

172
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:00,710
we're going to try to be more proactive

173
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,159
in announcing what we're doing and when

174
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,630
we're doing it these are some really

175
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,270
good references if you're sort of

176
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,349
confused about what I'm talking about

177
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,359
one thing that I'd really like to

178
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:13,340
highlight is Jeff Houston's link on here

179
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,789
and the slides will be available on the

180
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:19,250
on this site but Jeff really talks about

181
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:23,930
the problem with the fragmentation in

182
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:26,030
ipv6 you know v4 handles fragmentation

183
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,610
very differently than v6 and the

184
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:32,088
fragmentation of v6 does cause some very

185
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,529
significant problems in the DNS so I'd

186
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,550
like to point that one out the other

187
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,750
thing is fujiwara song from j PRS

188
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,250
reported recently you know until

189
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,000
recently we thought the the

190
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:47,440
fragmentation attacks on the dns we're

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,570
sort of lab only exercises but he's

192
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,950
maybe this isn't the case so we're

193
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,779
trying to get ahead of that as well and

194
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,620
so some of this is not only just for

195
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:59,019
functionality but for improved security

196
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,149
let's see

197
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:09,019
and I thought I had one more slide but I

198
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:10,610
guess I do not I do not okay oh this is

199
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,470
the older one it doesn't have I'm sorry

200
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,790
this this set doesn't have cat pictures

201
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,350
in it we did a new one that had cat

202
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,959
pictures and my apologies that one

203
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:21,110
didn't get updated anyway I sent oh it's

204
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,518
my fault okay so with that we have just

205
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,410
a few minutes if anyone has any

206
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,490
questions about this I'm happy to try to

207
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,490
address them

208
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:43,000
okay very good thank you

209
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:43,000
[Applause]

210
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,900
you
