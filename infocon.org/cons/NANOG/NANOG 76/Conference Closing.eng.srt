00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:04,120
girth organizational demographics as you

53
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:05,920
can see here this chunk of service

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,810
providers things haven't changed that

55
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,849
much over a time period but that's kind

56
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:17,290
of the breakdown of the people who

57
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:19,660
attend Nanog meetings membership as I

58
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,010
said before membership is core to

59
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,239
supporting the efforts and things that

60
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,679
we do here at nanog a little bit mazing

61
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,599
group of people who put on this

62
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,450
conference who make all of this work the

63
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:34,268
staff create the vessel we create the

64
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,000
marketing behind it but the program

65
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:40,120
committee make all of this happen so we

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,340
appreciate them and would all encourage

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,709
you guys to come become part of nanog

68
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,480
and remember level and help us achieve

69
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,250
the things that we're trying to do for

70
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,268
our could make our community better not

71
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,430
just the community here but the

72
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,959
community that stands outside of our

73
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,709
region's and our customers and the

74
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,709
people that we serve

75
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:03,780
so your expertise matters your voice is

76
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,420
always heard we have a platform where

77
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,040
there is no some organizations things

78
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,708
are based upon a corporate structure

79
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,108
where corporate sponsors run the meeting

80
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,959
Nanog is not that way it's a community

81
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:17,579
led effort and that community let every

82
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,079
creates a program that is distinctly

83
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,910
different than others that you would see

84
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,430
something that we hold sacred something

85
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,389
they'll hold special and again we'd like

86
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,150
you guys all to participate in that

87
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:32,010
additional perks of being memberships

88
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,359
early registration if you remember you

89
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,949
know those things but if you really want

90
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,360
to become a members to help and make a

91
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:46,669
difference outreach program we've

92
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:49,289
covered that a little bit I'm going to

93
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,490
okay we believe our industry talk about

94
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,130
diversity a second we believe our

95
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,750
industry should reflect the diversity of

96
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,570
the people that we serve and in the

97
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,800
world that we live in an outreach we're

98
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,409
looking to work with universities

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,419

100
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,860
