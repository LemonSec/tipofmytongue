1
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:19,380
awesome can you hear me

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:23,910
perfect so good morning welcome to knack

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,439
76 my first name is cam and I'm the

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,980
senior manager of network engineering at

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,570
Qualcomm

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,970
I've been in this field for the past

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,820
almost 22 years I started as a systems

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,280
engineer and over time moved to network

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,920
engineering and now my teens are

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,570
responsible for core when LAN

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,430
wireless automation you name it

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,720
different pieces of qualcomm network

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:52,850
leader in 5g they're interesting topics

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:55,800
today demystifying ipv6 over NPOs and

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,019
just something to say over the past two

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,419
decades a lot less business I know many

17
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:04,259
people some faces here and I'm privy to

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:08,610
many conversations not on ipv6 and MPLS

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,620
though on hiring process right trying to

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,170
find the right talents senior level

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,409
network engineers or architects with all

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,020
the cool certifications today expert

23
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,780
level certifications it's not hard to

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,429
find great experts right someone jump on

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,219
a keyboard put a bunch of commands or

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,680
maybe do the design we have J answer is

27
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,679
we have CCR is great technical skills

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,899
awesome but what are the challenges when

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,030
I get invited to a job interview either

30
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:39,119
our company or somewhere else or review

31
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,090
resumes there is a little piece and

32
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,429
that's this mindset of being able to

33
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,579
think outside the box and what a means

34
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:49,679
is not necessarily what every single

35
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,779
candidate claims it's very hard to find

36
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:53,670
a candidate that he walks into an

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,140
interview and says no I'm not an outside

38
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:01,229
the box thinker everybody is but today's

39
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,060
session this session is about v6 and

40
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,280
MPLS I get it absolutely we're going to

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,560
cover that but at the same time I want

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,560
to turn this into a mental practice for

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,090
all of us to just think outside the box

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,730
for a second and I will tell you it will

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:19,080
show you exactly why that is so

46
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,519
important moving on to next slide you

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,500
actually structured this session in a

48
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,000
very very easy way we're going to cover

49
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,330
basics of these X we all

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,440
talk about fundamentals of MPLS and then

51
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,220
we're going to talk about migration

52
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,630
strategies some pretty cool stuff I'm

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,340
also going to cover one of the

54
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,840
real-world scenarios we're going to talk

55
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,870
about the company and we're going to

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,480
show you how to decide how to roll out

57
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,090
to be sex in the network but that

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,010
outside-the-box thinking challenge that

59
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,770
is what it wants to really really focus

60
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,359
on if there is only one takeaway that I

61
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,430
want everyone to have when you're

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,070
leaving this room is that outside the

63
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,630
box thinking practice and that's so cool

64
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:02,280
and so important I will tell you exactly

65
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,690
why before any politician started

66
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,910
building walls we're talking about walls

67
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,760
we built walls trust me

68
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,739
we as network engineers any titles

69
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,540
network engineer architects a fashion

70
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,459
whoever we built walls the voice guy

71
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,140
started from here and it's that this is

72
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,850
my voice network I'm not responsible for

73
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,760
the enterprise part I don't care about

74
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,280
your core routing the enterprise got

75
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
here he said you know what the wireless

76
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,360
guys I don't care about your network

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,340
your RF your API controller is that's

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,170
your space whatever is going on that

79
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,420
space you guys got to take care of it

80
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,548
that's not my problem

81
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,530
the security guy actually followed the

82
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,820
exact same long sets you'll talk to the

83
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,190
data center people you hear the same

84
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,870
thing service provider person your swing

85
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,180
you talk to service providers as long as

86
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,989
I have PE to PE connectivity I'm totally

87
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,180
fine I don't care about anybody else and

88
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,610
from my perspective sitting here well as

89
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,709
long as I can get to your PE then from

90
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,570
that point on that's your problem from a

91
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,670
responsibility perspective I get it

92
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,700
that's important absolutely important

93
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,369
that's fine I mean it's obvious you're

94
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,410
not you're not gonna be do you're not

95
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,250
gonna be able to do everything that's

96
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,350
common sense but at the same time if all

97
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,079
these walls all these compartments

98
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:25,370
sylars cells or whatever you want to

99
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:28,169
call them we sort of decided to ignore

100
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,970
solutions that each one of these towers

101
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:33,240
each one of these cells compartments

102
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,490
silos they came up with this session is

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,310
about removing what at least one of

104
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,220
those walls or trying to remove

105
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,560
tear down one of those walls and going

106
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,870
to this service for water worth grabbing

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,670
what the solutions that's proven it's

108
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,160
been around for many many years

109
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,530
speed or not we know it's a hundred

110
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,650
percent baked solution and bring it over

111
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,020
to the enterprise world and try to solve

112
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,900
one of our problems in enterprise world

113
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,580
that's why I really like this session

114
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:06,020
that's why my favorite really really

115
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,419
favorite sessions so there are this is

116
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,729
actually one of the interesting slides

117
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,170
there are some very common themes and

118
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,220
I'm sure when we start talking about

119
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:17,840
those you will kind of relate to this ah

120
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,150
it might sound funny but it's not really

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,060
that funny but let's talk about them

122
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,620
anyways there is one and we call a new

123
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:29,900
seesaw syndrome or a new security of

124
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,610
send your Security Manager syndrome you

125
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,010
work in a company you or the new Caesar

126
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,060
or you just hire a new sister or this is

127
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,670
a new security guy

128
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,400
the very first thing they look at the

129
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,410
problems and see wow look we have a lot

130
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,880
of issues there are a lot of

131
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,520
opportunities there are a lot of

132
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,840
security concerns what we need funding

133
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,580
for that or gotta get my hands on some

134
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,369
in a bunch of money in order to be able

135
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,349
to fix all those problems

136
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:57,380
the very first thing just human mind

137
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,450
just myself my human brain we connect

138
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,210
the dots based on our habits with some

139
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,860
things that we're absolutely useful

140
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,539
that's more of a things you see all

141
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,310
those problems you weren't funding you

142
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,590
just got the job there we go we start

143
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,010
scanning the network you grab some

144
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:16,250
vulnerability scanner and trust me you

145
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:19,280
scan 50,000 hosts and you can just get

146
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:22,700
trust me you can just go ahead and grab

147
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,090
a Ford f-150 just the back of the truck

148
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,039
and thousands and thousands of pages of

149
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,500
vulnerabilities and take it straight you

150
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,110
CFO's office and have him signed a check

151
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,310
for you yeah it absolutely is possible

152
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,400
people do it and it works all the time

153
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:41,060
actually 95% of the time there is that

154
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,370
5% that you can potentially take the

155
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,740
entire network down or maybe half of

156
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,920
another senior of Los Angeles down by

157
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,030
scanning boy just recklessly scanning a

158
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,400
network like

159
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,250
the slow Network dira SCADA systems out

160
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,429
there through PLC systems out there and

161
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,440
just what another Walder we decided to

162
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,720
build that wall in case you haven't

163
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,460
noticed between the network engineering

164
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,700
world

165
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:10,280
maybe IT if you will and industrial

166
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,170
world we do not speak to come any common

167
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,330
language it's extremely hard for people

168
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,780
who just walk in and say you know I want

169
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:20,180
to secure your network but I might

170
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,099
actually take your network down that's

171
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,800
one of those use cases that you just

172
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,290
cannot apply that common sense the

173
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,140
inside the box thinking approach to the

174
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:34,970
problem

175
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:38,780
moving on to ipv6 so I'm sure many

176
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:42,470
people here quick show of hands how many

177
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,960
of you here you have ipv6 any kind of

178
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,800
ipv6 in your network almost everyone

179
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,630
when you start talking about ipv6 the

180
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,290
very first reaction again human brain

181
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,180
myself my brain included we think about

182
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,190
two things very first things that come

183
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,650
to mind either tunneling old website

184
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,450
right we do tunnels we do tall stack

185
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,659
these are the very first two things you

186
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:09,260
go to job interview first question and

187
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:12,830
tension is to the answer twirling or

188
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:15,020
dosac why we're trying it any work trust

189
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,870
me I have many use cases in the past

190
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,469
that the solution worked perfectly this

191
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,630
session is about maybe another saloon

192
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,120
maybe if there is a third way maybe

193
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,340
there is another possibility to talk

194
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,040
about this problem maybe there is

195
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:35,348
another solution that is not as invasive

196
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:39,620
as doing dual stack or not shaky as

197
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:42,320
tunneling this session by the way is a

198
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,390
tutorial it is not an expert level

199
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,490
advanced session it is a tutorial and

200
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,310
not just a technical tutorial but also

201
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:54,350
this outside-the-box thinking tutorial

202
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:56,329
so just to set the right expectations at

203
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,220
the end of this session I'm really

204
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,350
hoping that all of us you have at this

205
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,630
one more tool in our toolbox it's not

206
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,410
going to be a magic but we're gonna show

207
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,720
you that's

208
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,478
you know tunneling there a lot of

209
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,819
different ways also you probably have

210
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:13,429
done dual-stack but this is yet another

211
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:17,569
way of doing this and that won't

212
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:19,098
actually work in your case so let's

213
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:22,279
forget about the whole IP world for a

214
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:24,529
second I'll talk about travel and you

215
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,079
know traveling on the world how many

216
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:34,669
people have traveled to more than 40

217
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:38,358
countries more than 30 excellents more

218
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:42,589
than 20 that's not bad I mean yeah I

219
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:44,209
guess everybody's local so one of the

220
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,829
interesting thing is one of the amazing

221
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,508
things when you travel I'm a very

222
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:49,969
curious person I keep asking questions

223
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:52,279
about all sorts of things that are not

224
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,519
necessarily related to a business so

225
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,689
this thing here is my passport right

226
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,659
something very cool about this passport

227
00:09:56,689 --> 00:10:01,488
is many years ago people came up with an

228
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:03,859
idea set of standards for these

229
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:06,079
passports so when you travel to put some

230
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:08,029
foreign territory all you have to do is

231
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,378
you present your passport you even don't

232
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,539
have to speak the language rights you

233
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,399
just present your passport and someone

234
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:15,319
looks at passwords and you know probably

235
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,179
he's going to stamp it and from that

236
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:18,858
point on you can just travel through

237
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:21,259
this country when you get to the border

238
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:23,839
and then leave that country in other

239
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:25,879
stamp and outs that's a great progress

240
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,720
trust me that's an international

241
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:32,479
agreements but again world traveler it's

242
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,549
probably you will know about driver's

243
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:36,949
licenses driver's licenses when you get

244
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:37,819
to really get to the area it gets a

245
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:41,299
little bit muddy

246
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:43,669
so some countries Australia one example

247
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:45,889
I can use my California driver's license

248
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:47,569
go to Australia and drive and I can do

249
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:50,089
the exact same thing I can drive on my

250
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:52,488
Australian license New South Wales to

251
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:56,209
drive here in the States for a number of

252
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:58,850
months but there are countries that you

253
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:01,069
can ask me and I have no idea you have

254
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,569
to google that and when you giggle with

255
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:04,608
someone says no it was a great

256
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:07,579
experience I wasn't about to drive on my

257
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:09,259
local license some other folks say no we

258
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,969
actually got pulled over and the guy had

259
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:16,200
no idea actually what was written on

260
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:18,390
this so those cases they do exist I

261
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,130
we do have those problems I would link

262
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,790
that to our problems in the networking

263
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:26,340
world very soon let's go on an imaginary

264
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,750
trip we're going to some country we're

265
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,850
going to go we're gonna go to some

266
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,740
foreign territory interesting thing

267
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,810
about that country is they don't speak a

268
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,000
language at all they have no idea about

269
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:41,040
your ID they can't even read it

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,380
but anyways you have to pass through in

271
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,250
order to pass through you have to do

272
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:51,200
something about it and one of the ideas

273
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:55,580
is to have a common language right I

274
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,480
have my driver's license but they're not

275
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,110
they're not gonna be able to read my

276
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,360
license

277
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,070
he actually won't honor that at all they

278
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,530
have no idea what it means when it

279
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,960
produced my ID he can't read it

280
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,449
that's the header when I talk to them

281
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,500
when I try to explain the situation

282
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,290
they're not gonna understand me

283
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,410
that's the payload right so no idea

284
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:20,520
whatsoever we are looking for a common

285
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,620
language that common language might be

286
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,760
numbers actually some smart people came

287
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,130
with that idea that look numbers are

288
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,810
sort of universal so pretty much

289
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:34,250
anywhere in the world that you travel

290
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:36,479
this is number 2 or 2 up something I

291
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,550
have heard jokes that there is at least

292
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,120
1% that you go somewhere and this is

293
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:45,240
like 6 I get it but generally speaking

294
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,670
generally speaking there is a great

295
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,680
majority in the world I mean huge number

296
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:52,140
of people they agree this is number 5

297
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,589
and I mean 5 of something so we can use

298
00:12:52,140 --> 00:13:00,180
that as some kind of universal language

299
00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:02,870
numbers right so it's possible to apply

300
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,870
after let me go back and finish my

301
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:09,780
non-technical lecture here so it's

302
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,240
possible to just think about this for a

303
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,449
second yet when I'm done presenting my

304
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,340
ID I might be able to also present some

305
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,410
number I will show you exactly what it

306
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,300
means and we have the same problem you

307
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,280
IP world like I mentioned we have a

308
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,140
layer chiyomi have layer 3 on our

309
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,350
packets a layer 3 might be an ipv4

310
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,470
header might be an ipv6 header and on

311
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,300
the line network

312
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,360
may or may not understand anything about

313
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:38,560
it you're trying to push a layer three

314
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,900
header which is a lot been before or v6

315
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,079
went on the line Network looks at it and

316
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:47,020
says Colin Colin what does that mean

317
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,270
Colin what or even the structure of the

318
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,880
header absolutely nonsense to down the

319
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,829
line Network so we can probably and I

320
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,740
will show you exactly how I apply the

321
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:59,130
same concept I use numbers not just when

322
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:03,070
you're traveling but also in this world

323
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:06,760
it has a name it's called MPLS exactly

324
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,860
that is what MPLS is all about I'm here

325
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,439
less when you grab MPLS books actually

326
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:15,100
they're extremely awesome books out

327
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,050
there on offering one MPLS not MPLS but

328
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,320
network engineering interviews book and

329
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:23,530
it's it has a lot of MPLS bells and

330
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,080
whistles what trust me all the fluff

331
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,780
aside MPLS is exactly what we just

332
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,850
talked about you want to travel in some

333
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,100
foreign territory instead of using your

334
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:37,930
own original idea you're gonna be using

335
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:41,050
some numbers and that's it how simple

336
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,880
this is my ID I want to travel I wanna

337
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,099
go somewhere and I have no idea this is

338
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,010
the very first step I see the first

339
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,980
security guy a number is title to my

340
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,600
passport I just walked through I see the

341
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,870
second security guy might be different

342
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,790
city might be a different checkpoints

343
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,230
they gonna look at the number they're

344
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,920
going to swap that number with something

345
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,560
else that the next post told us guys

346
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,650
next post next post and expose what the

347
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,650
time I get to the end of their

348
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,750
boundaries the last post they just take

349
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,790
that number off and I just walk back

350
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,740
into my original country were they able

351
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:23,439
to read my passwords and honor my

352
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,880
identity we're gonna do exact we're

353
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,140
gonna do the exact same thing in IP

354
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,990
world and I'll show you what so here is

355
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,510
one real-world example that's actually a

356
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,339
packet if you look at the layer two part

357
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,770
of that we have the Ethernet - that's a

358
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:42,070
layer two you see the MAC addresses also

359
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,630
down the bottom you see the ipv6 there

360
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,330
is a sorcerer's that I said

361
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,070
I was just looking at the source I can

362
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,960
tell you it's a web server talking to a

363
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,310
web clients but these things are all

364
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,180
coming since you already didn't know

365
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,729
about all that

366
00:15:52,180 --> 00:16:00,420
we all know all those fields but we also

367
00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:07,030
inserted sort of wedged to numbers to

368
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:09,400
hear these things label 17 and label 25

369
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,410
these are the two stickers these are the

370
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,720
two numbers those are these are the two

371
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,300
cards these are the two labels that are

372
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,980
attached to my packets for that packet

373
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:22,030
to make sense to the art to the

374
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:25,930
underlying network we're gonna cover

375
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,990
that naturally great details just let's

376
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:31,209
uh bear with me and we will cover that

377
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:33,550
so for now I guess the stage that we

378
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,410
know we have a problem we know there are

379
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,719
some potential solutions and we want to

380
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:41,140
look at some of those solutions one very

381
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:44,340
specifically in this case 6pe I want to

382
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:47,650
talk a little bit about v6 this is

383
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:50,050
probably the slide that all of you have

384
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,880
already seen many people hate and I will

385
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,240
tell you exactly why that's about the

386
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,210
falling sky it's a falling skies to joke

387
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,270
many years ago late 90s I was much

388
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:04,440
younger and my early days my boss barged

389
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:07,420
into my room right in the morning and

390
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,790
disaster something like the y2k thing

391
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,709
but different theme so what's going on

392
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,990
what's exactly this disaster how many

393
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:15,160
ipv4 zappysys do you have right now I

394
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,359
don't know

395
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,490
fanni probably I can double-check look

396
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,319
before exhaustion we're running out of

397
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,050
befores the wall is running out of a

398
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,359
force very soon people are gonna stop

399
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,970
using befores and we're going to be

400
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,070
moving completely over to be sex that

401
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:39,010
was the story trust me Sterling was just

402
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:42,879
that harsh scared everyone Jerry my

403
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:46,270
manager dual actually retired ten years

404
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,070
ago he resides in Florida and the only

405
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,590
thing that it doesn't care about is v6o

406
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,470
before a migration one what I'm doing

407
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,750
this as God is long gone is enjoying his

408
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,519
margarita on the beach but here's the

409
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,969
thing

410
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:02,999
the problem is real what big are

411
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:05,309
solutions after that as engineers we

412
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,779
would like I would like everyone to

413
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,639
explore and today we're going to be

414
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:10,559
talking about one of those options we

415
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:13,139
know the number of IP addresses we know

416
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,418
about the fields and everything v6

417
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:18,389
Internet is a reality we have some

418
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:21,690
70,000 rats right there and the

419
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:24,958
protocols are pretty much aware I guess

420
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,940
to some extent most most vendors when

421
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:29,549
you talk to them they do support bgp

422
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,579
Cisco APIs families or juniper or

423
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:34,349
restore everybody I can't really think

424
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,749
of a vendor they do not support any sex

425
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:39,178
at all yes of course BJP Anya spice was

426
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:41,669
one of the very first ones due to tlvs

427
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:44,639
and all the great extendibility features

428
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:48,929
they got to be six and that was cool

429
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:54,359
always bf4 is supported your ERP factor

430
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:56,369
Cisco does support v6 there were a

431
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:58,739
little bit problems of XR but now it's

432
00:18:56,369 --> 00:19:01,499
fully supported quality of service read

433
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:04,079
the labels we read the labels we also

434
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:07,979
read be called service fields and make

435
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,059
decisions label multicast auto RP if

436
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,479
you're using it it's not supported

437
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,339
anymore

438
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:13,200
but there is BS r there's as a same

439
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:15,059
bunch of other things and that's cool I

440
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:21,200
actually missed something there

441
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:23,489
rip rip is supported to its core FNG

442
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,309
when we talk about we get a lot of

443
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:28,679
smiles and people joking or usool using

444
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:29,999
clip there are networks out there there

445
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,429
are pretty big networks out there and

446
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:33,929
they use they do use rip you don't need

447
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:36,959
anything else you have a bunch of router

448
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:39,299
is like chain of routers in there one

449
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:45,119
rip and it's been there forever it's

450
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:46,859
stable so rip ng is supported to one of

451
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,820
the very first questions when they stop

452
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:49,408
talking about v6

453
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:53,070
let's just get this out of a way look

454
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:54,899
right here that why not v6 everywhere

455
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,639
I'm building a new building it's a new

456
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:59,458
site it's a new data center it's in your

457
00:19:56,639 --> 00:20:01,769
lab it's a new place why not

458
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:03,779
v6 from scratch let's just treat this as

459
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:05,789
a greenfield and roll out this X from

460
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,739
the get-go there are all challenges

461
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:10,260
there we will be covering all that today

462
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:12,390
but when you talk about production that

463
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,310
availability is a big concern we don't

464
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,770
want to roll out features that we have

465
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:20,129
not tested a lot there are some security

466
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:22,170
concerns they and the security guy when

467
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:26,790
you talk to your sister or your senior

468
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:30,390
whatever security managers they are not

469
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:34,730
as comfortable as with ipv6 features as

470
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:37,920
they are the ipv4 as the orifice v6

471
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:40,200
before so there are some security areas

472
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,270
to explore but that application thing is

473
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,150
a big one there are applications after

474
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:48,870
with hard-coded the four fields they're

475
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,460
not easy to migrate to these sets that's

476
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:52,830
one challenge and I'm not even talking

477
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,900
about IBM or whatever mainframes running

478
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,909
cobol applications I'm talking about

479
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,990
you're probably through a server I'm

480
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,600
talking about some corporate

481
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:03,150
applications so it's not as easy as I

482
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,780
decide to go v6 and they want and I can

483
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:09,390
go just out to be sex everywhere also we

484
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,610
will cover that the migration solutions

485
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,900
are complicated - trust me there are

486
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:17,159
challenges there are some hidden

487
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:19,950
challenges that people suno later they

488
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,360
found out maybe it's not just as easy as

489
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:26,720
just you know we run a bunch of these

490
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:29,540
four and v6 IP addresses on interfaces

491
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,600
the first solution that many people

492
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:35,280
rolled out with it - actually I cannot

493
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,260
think of a single company that it worked

494
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,810
for or talk to and they never tried or

495
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,270
such threes dual stack everywhere right

496
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:45,240
people locked it was like so you have

497
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,700
your before router of all the v4 IP

498
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,200
addresses and everything you run v6 at

499
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:54,450
the same time it's a very invasive

500
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:58,890
challenge why because if you have if you

501
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,990
have 50 routers for example well you

502
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,520
have a set of features variety before

503
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,830
now you're going to have this exact same

504
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,210
set of features for me six I have a

505
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,280
slides on this and I will show you some

506
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,560
of the challenges in that area and it's

507
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,389
not really a migration strategy people

508
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,300
who decided to do dual stack that

509
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:19,050
migration strategy trusts me that

510
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:21,990
migration travel is going to take years

511
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:23,879
and probably many of those travelers

512
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,580
have not arrived yet there's still

513
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,709
travel

514
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:30,580
it's just like I decide to emigrate to

515
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:34,779
Canada and you know what the process is

516
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,609
gonna take 21 years so that's not really

517
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:39,489
a migration strategy is sort of no

518
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:40,928
accommodation at the same time but many

519
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:43,149
people do that and we'll we'll talk

520
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:44,859
about it here's also tunneling we've

521
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:46,330
been doing tunneling for a while all

522
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:49,629
sort of tunnels people are comfortable

523
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:51,908
with jury IP sick who doesn't have it

524
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:53,769
everybody we have virgin multiple

525
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:55,989
different versions of files our

526
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:59,919
experience my personal experience and I

527
00:22:55,989 --> 00:23:03,219
work in many vendors compatibility and

528
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:07,239
that's nice interoperability making sure

529
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:09,099
that vendor a can talk to vendor B that

530
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:11,649
might be a challenge in the future but

531
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:13,928
not on day one on day one your problem

532
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:17,889
is gonna be vendor ain't talking to

533
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:20,259
vendor a oh I had one vendor one vendor

534
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:23,408
hundred-percent rasa vendor to gathers

535
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:25,869
in the technical support was unable to

536
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:27,639
find out what was going on so they had

537
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:29,889
to do packet captures go back to the

538
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:31,988
product team look at the packets and

539
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:33,699
backs are you well I look there is

540
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:35,139
actually you guys are hitting a blog

541
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,239
that it's not really a bog it's

542
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:39,428
something that we just did not develop

543
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:41,889
maybe we should get this on a road map

544
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:44,169
so there are those use cases with

545
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:47,849
tunneling it's not as easy as I decide

546
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:50,429
to run this tile and it just happens a

547
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:52,989
little bit about my employer in Qualcomm

548
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:59,799
very interesting story Qualcomm found in

549
00:23:52,989 --> 00:24:02,200
85 leader in 5g and we have a very very

550
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:05,709
very large community of engineers what

551
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:11,799
they do is they design chipsets for cell

552
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:13,570
phones 4G 5g and we need to test these X

553
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:16,329
we need to make sure that your phone

554
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:20,559
your future phone works with ipv6 so

555
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:23,320
it's a supercritical case any mistake if

556
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,908
people forget to do some testing you

557
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,859
might grab your phone actually millions

558
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:30,969
of phones out there and something just

559
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:34,418
doesn't work that's a pretty big deal we

560
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:37,530
decided to use offhe v6 and we actually

561
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:39,120
tried different things right even

562
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,190
right now we have a mix of pretty much

563
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,979
everything not more time to cooperate by

564
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:45,870
t side I can't really think of a single

565
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,910
case someone just a random employee

566
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:50,669
knocks on your door and says you know

567
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:54,060
what today I decided to use v6 no but we

568
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:55,620
do have some production v6 use cases and

569
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,860
also I was working at LinkedIn the other

570
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:01,199
day Sims after over 1,500 jobs directly

571
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,659
related to me 6 so the demand is real

572
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,720
really people are asking for v6 and

573
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,760
there are v6 use cases today we want to

574
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,820
cover one of those cases and we want to

575
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:15,000
apply a not so usual

576
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,669
solution to that problem down to our

577
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,190
business this is an ipv4 header

578
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:22,800
everybody send us trust me I have the

579
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:25,050
layer 2 layer 3 and also a it for

580
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,860
headers there it's an ICMP packets

581
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:32,730
simple and I use over sphere for eius

582
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:37,500
eius might be eius eius whatever level 2

583
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:39,630
or OSPF as soon as you run your IGP

584
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,870
entire running domain is going to learn

585
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:47,100
about those 2000 routes pretty simple

586
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:49,110
and then ipv4 packets starts traveling

587
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,350
traversing through the network one hop

588
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,389
to another very simple process and makes

589
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,760
at the end of the network this is what

590
00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:01,890
happens there are networks every day but

591
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:05,250
let's look at the ipv6 packets layer 2

592
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:08,520
layer 3 earlier for data pretty cool

593
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:11,370
stuff right now I have two islands of

594
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,110
the 6 in our case those two islands

595
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:17,580
might be determined to manufacturing

596
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:19,500
floors to engineering labs to q/a places

597
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,740
that people are testing ipv6 and the

598
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,390
absolutely need v6 in this case we have

599
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,730
video tools that I mean common sense

600
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,710
right you hire this engineer and he

601
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,170
jumps on the edge ladder he configures

602
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:33,390
ipv6 on that box and goes to green boxes

603
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:35,220
and also he goes to those two islands

604
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:38,280
and he configures a bunch of ipv6

605
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:41,270
addresses for our engineers to inside

606
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:44,910
those boxes and we're good to go

607
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:47,250
that's an ipv6 packet and it's ready to

608
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,560
start its travel I jump on this guy and

609
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,169
right there without even making it

610
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,999
anything

611
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:56,369
that's gonna say no route I have no idea

612
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:58,590
what to do with it because obviously you

613
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:02,158
do not have any v6 in a core of your

614
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:04,619
network we're always looking for ideas

615
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,200
one way of doing this I guess it's a

616
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:09,840
very obvious way inside the box again is

617
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,039
tunneling this is what most engineers

618
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,249
especially when we deal with isolated

619
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:20,070
cases enact this like very small-scale

620
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:22,259
things we apply tunneling why not let's

621
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:25,649
do that there we go here is a tunnel

622
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:27,809
cross vendor issues you know what's one

623
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:30,689
vendor I was having issues you might be

624
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:32,249
a lucky one who knows but as you

625
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,779
increase the number of vendors the

626
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:35,940
number of platforms the number of codes

627
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:38,460
you might run into issues it's not as

628
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,999
easy but let's say everything's tested

629
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,419
in a lab you're happy we're good to go

630
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:47,879
do is this is scalability question two

631
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:52,169
but when we talk about this solution

632
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:54,959
tunnel link and great engineers always

633
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:57,529
they talk back and say look this is a

634
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,759
smaller scale design I have two sites

635
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:03,059
requirement is very simple and I need

636
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:05,479
like a patch a solution for now codon

637
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:09,109
codes and we're good to go

638
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:12,119
awesome that's a patch it does work I

639
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:15,570
absolutely have no problem with that

640
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:18,089
what over time this is your network you

641
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,519
start rolling out those tunnels and this

642
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:22,529
X is not something that it stays just in

643
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,119
one location over time you're going to

644
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:26,369
have more recess customers that was

645
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,168
exactly iris theory and you start

646
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:30,539
rolling out more tunnels your network

647
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:33,419
starts growing maybe cooking and

648
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:35,729
eventually you're gonna have this trust

649
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,830
me I like a spaghetti I absolutely love

650
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:40,830
it that's one of my favorite foods there

651
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:43,320
is a little problem spaghetti I will

652
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,210
tell you what's so cool about us I have

653
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,668
some of the greatest automation

654
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,019
engineers in the world I'm very very

655
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:51,960
proud of them they can automate

656
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:55,909
everything including tunnels including

657
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:59,099
all those noodles right it's possible to

658
00:28:55,909 --> 00:29:01,950
optimize that it's possible to automate

659
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:04,040
it so it's not really manual you can

660
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,680
definitely make the argument and say

661
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,649
I have 1,000 tunnels for Marshall cares

662
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,270
and it's fully automated not a problem

663
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,940
we are monitoring it we're rolling it

664
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:16,100
out no problems whatsoever there is

665
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:19,640
another problem with that design and we

666
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,860
kind of touched on that today if you

667
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,040
have one vendor one platform one code

668
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,870
and everything is a stable tomorrow

669
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,210
you're going to have to upgrade one of

670
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,340
your devices you're not what your

671
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:33,860
network is absolutely impossible that

672
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,820
you can guarantee for unforeseeable

673
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,030
future

674
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,700
you run single vendor single platform

675
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:42,620
and single code you start upgrading your

676
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,230
edge devices and you start running into

677
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:48,199
issues you are fixing BGP you're fixing

678
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:51,410
BFD you are fixing BFP for eius eius

679
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,620
blog and you are upgrading a coat your

680
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:56,150
tunnels they start flapping well not

681
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:59,030
sure how your automation engineer can

682
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:01,490
help you out but probably the solution

683
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,050
is let's go to the layout and describe

684
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,700
the code to make sure the code is a

685
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:06,200
stable and then go back to the

686
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,180
environment and just upgrade everything

687
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,270
so we're gonna go from version to

688
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:15,170
version 2.2 to make sure everything is

689
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:17,090
stable and that story is going to

690
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,950
contain you pretty much forever you

691
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:26,000
upgrade something you break your tunnels

692
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:27,650
and you go back so that's an interesting

693
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,830
arguments that all gets all the time

694
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:33,290
that's a temporary solution guys trust

695
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,990
me you you all know that I don't have to

696
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,700
repeat this but the most permanent

697
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,020
solutions in the world in our worlds

698
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,390
network engineering core the pair are

699
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,830
the temporary ones things that only you

700
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,630
know what just for today let's just do

701
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:47,149
this I'm gonna do this one is static

702
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:49,910
you're out here one static IP address

703
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:51,290
here later I'll fix it I'm gonna go back

704
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:54,380
to this I'm going to fix it at some

705
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:59,050
point and eventually you can have that

706
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:01,520
pile of mess we all deal with that so

707
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,470
the third one that's actually very

708
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,300
interesting very very interesting

709
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,570
arguments that all get all the time

710
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:11,600
look tunnels are temporary I'm gonna do

711
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,550
tunnels between now and you know six

712
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,500
month from now and in six months we're

713
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,669
gonna go to do a stack so we're gonna

714
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,500
have time to decide

715
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,050
what you're gonna do dual starch now I'm

716
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,550
gonna get rid of all this tunnels I

717
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:26,090
would love to believe you I mean there

718
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:29,060
is no way absolutely right get it so

719
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:32,629
let's do it now it's been six months and

720
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:35,629
now I want to go do such ipv4 and me sex

721
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:38,840
everywhere you can definitely make this

722
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:41,870
apartment and say yeah we're not gonna

723
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,939
do everywhere as much as we need it I'm

724
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,860
going to pick I'm actually going to hand

725
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,590
pick some of these routers some of this

726
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:50,510
part of a network excuse me

727
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,669
some of these parts of the network for

728
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,890
example here I'm going to upgrade these

729
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:59,600
five or six routers and we need these

730
00:31:54,890 --> 00:32:04,970
sexier well that's not really that easy

731
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:09,830
but I will show you exactly why nots now

732
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:12,860
in the core partially or wholly you're

733
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:16,010
gonna have very small networked 50

734
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:18,469
routers or 150 or 1500 routers running

735
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:20,990
v4 and v6 features at the same time

736
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,940
let's say everything is stable you're

737
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:26,630
not running into box and no security

738
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:29,030
issues and everything is working but are

739
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,230
you sure everything is supported and you

740
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,760
don't have to make any changes for

741
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,100
example if you're running multicast or

742
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,830
ORP with before there is no other work

743
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,629
in Deus Ex so that's not really apples

744
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,129
to apples so you're gonna have to come

745
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,860
up with some other solutions but let's

746
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:46,010
say you called your vendor and on the

747
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:48,530
phone the sales guy he absolutely says

748
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:52,190
why not and you believe you which is

749
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:54,020
great know what uh we just got off the

750
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,860
phone everything is supported and that's

751
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:59,480
great you watch the walk in there that's

752
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:03,310
welcome to the rest actually the first

753
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:07,880
day of rest of your life now where we go

754
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:11,000
it's not really that bad first question

755
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,730
you have to decide to one extent do you

756
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,880
really want to roll us out ten batters

757
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:19,700
15 ladders 1500 routers how are they

758
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,660
gonna interact you know what we're tube

759
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,490
is that we're not going to make that

760
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,350
decision we're just gonna you know just

761
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,880
bank a change we're gonna change every

762
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:29,500
single router in the core we're gonna go

763
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,500
to all stock everywhere in a core

764
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:36,220
again some features and codes do I have

765
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,570
to scrub those features so I have to go

766
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,660
back to the lab and make sure everything

767
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:43,600
works probably and these six features

768
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,770
dear great they are almost match you

769
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,949
were but you'll not be they're not

770
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,470
features how many people how many people

771
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:53,110
have been how many feel out there you

772
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:55,210
can find and they used v6 in the core

773
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:57,520
pretty much the same configuration same

774
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,740
design as your network those are these

775
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,530
are those cases that you have to explore

776
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:07,169
and the hardware doesn't support it

777
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:09,610
I guess so we'll see soon and also

778
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:11,080
maintenance windows we don't care about

779
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,790
maintenance windows we have maintenance

780
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,299
windows but when you deal with

781
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:19,060
mission-critical networks especially the

782
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,550
ones this poor capacity planning it's

783
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,590
not that easy many years ago people

784
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:26,950
built this network and they had two

785
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:29,590
circuits eight circuits whatever for

786
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:32,770
capacity planning extra capacity but

787
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:35,950
over time they eventually I mean

788
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:38,790
initially they decided not to exceed 50

789
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:41,859
percent so 50 percent as soon as they

790
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,389
approached 48 percent they added some

791
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:46,600
more capacity to have enough redundancy

792
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:48,970
but many networks in the core today do

793
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,159
you just do not have enough capacity to

794
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,899
have maintenance windows like that and

795
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,149
I'm going to touch every single router

796
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:59,080
you are going to impact some customers

797
00:34:55,149 --> 00:35:01,210
we had that case new features new box

798
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,009
might be even the hardware it's the

799
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:06,850
ability in a core is always a concern

800
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:09,130
especially maintenance windows we talked

801
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,720
about the box and also automation I'm

802
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,580
monitoring things that you have for

803
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,580
before all the automation and mine

804
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,230
during the may or may not work for v6

805
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,700
that's one of the questions you have to

806
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:22,570
ask and also a learning curve our

807
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:27,100
experience six months so talented smart

808
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:30,790
engineers with no v6 experience should

809
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:32,970
be able to configure to some extent

810
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:36,820
design I speak to ipv6 in six months so

811
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:38,980
that's sort of the watermark if you if

812
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,380
you told me I had some one of my my

813
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,640
network and the guy is able to pick this

814
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,460
up in three months

815
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,810
oh it's great but average is around six

816
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,050
months so there is a learning curve and

817
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:52,000
cost associate that little bit beyond

818
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,130
the scope routing and stability is a

819
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,590
problem I'm not sure how much I sighs

820
00:35:54,130 --> 00:36:00,340
experience you have but as you start

821
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:03,040
talking about two different negative

822
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,630
three networks I feel before NRP v6

823
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,460
there are multiple different topologies

824
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:10,450
you have to keep that in mind might not

825
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:13,000
be as predictable as you expect and also

826
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:17,620
systems readiness trust me we are

827
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,810
network engineers we are just throwing a

828
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:23,290
number out there seems that we are close

829
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:25,870
to 80% ready if you wanted to upgrade

830
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:29,320
your network to d6 your devices your

831
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,910
codes 80% ready when you talk to

832
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,220
application people database people

833
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,390
mainframe all these sort of things I'm

834
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:39,359
not even talking about all your team

835
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:43,950
right they are no worry close to 80% so

836
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:48,250
these are our challenges in this space

837
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:50,049
but it's complicated we get it but sure

838
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,300
so quirements we want to see the

839
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,670
requirements let's say we go together to

840
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,580
the CIO CEOs office and we want to see

841
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:00,370
the requirements of course I were the

842
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:03,480
best of both worlds you told us about

843
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:05,620
dual stack you also told us math tunnels

844
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,110
we want to have these six searchability

845
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,460
no doubt about it into our rich ability

846
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:12,460
I don't want to run into that spaghetti

847
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:15,160
thing I absolutely hated it and also new

848
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,890
features you know what's gonna stay out

849
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,750
of our core v6 is cool that's super

850
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,490
awesome but don't touch the core I don't

851
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:23,290
want any of these new features in the

852
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:27,790
core that's one of the requirements many

853
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:29,170
many networks unfortunately though so we

854
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,570
want something proven something that's

855
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:34,210
being used for many years and at the

856
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,920
same time you know what we actually

857
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,830
heard of something pretty cool seems

858
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,200
like some people are able to steer the

859
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:43,029
traffic on the network on an oil is

860
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,589
called but you can make different

861
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:50,500
decisions based on Cuse marking based on

862
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:52,120
v4 v6 just go to this hop don't go to

863
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,040
that HOF if you go to this home and

864
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,920
there's a failure there take this bat

865
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,259
and then take the other path

866
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,819
that's pretty cool actually let's see if

867
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:04,799
we can do that or and also that one you

868
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:07,558
know what can we absolutely love your v6

869
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:09,630
what keep it in your ankle Aves keep it

870
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:12,359
within your own plates I don't want any

871
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:15,750
of that v6 anywhere in my network and

872
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:19,460
also the learning curve six months dude

873
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:22,859
that's not gonna work for us so yeah

874
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:25,140
this is sort of our general high-level

875
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:29,420
requirements there's also a list of nice

876
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:31,769
to have things make sure it's scalable

877
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,420
thousands of routes in a future if

878
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:35,490
needed we can expand it pretty quickly

879
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,750
you need new sites you can bring it up

880
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:41,819
and also you know what we heard of that

881
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,200
VLAN and like our to extension I know

882
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,029
that now that you're touching the

883
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,069
network is absolutely irrelevant but at

884
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:50,760
the same time I want to make sure that's

885
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:54,630
when we're doing this your solution can

886
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:58,650
support this so if I if I have part of

887
00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:01,140
my network here saying VLAN in different

888
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,970
country different city on the same VLAN

889
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,160
and we want to have connectivity it's

890
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,649
crazy I absolutely hate that but that's

891
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,940
that's there many people's requirements

892
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:14,970
and also very low convergence time many

893
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,609
people heard of that 50 milliseconds

894
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:20,250
things and that's cool we actually want

895
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:22,319
that this is sort of requirement that we

896
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:25,950
get all the time as we start talking

897
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:28,650
about rolling out a major big feature

898
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:31,859
just like ipv6 in network and it's not

899
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:34,410
really relevant I get it but so what

900
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:36,180
tunneling really did for us it added a

901
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:39,029
little bit of something that something

902
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:41,220
is that tunnel part that header to your

903
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:42,869
packets so your packet was able to

904
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,578
traverse through the network just like

905
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:49,430
this thicker just like a card that you

906
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:52,019
attach new ID this is an MPLS header

907
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:53,940
super simple trust me that's one of the

908
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:57,269
easiest thing it doesn't have anything

909
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,829
actually has food for sections tool the

910
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:01,200
most important part of that is the label

911
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:03,480
and that's a number that's a number that

912
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,859
you attach to a passport that's it

913
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,859
that's header

914
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,580
just like that you insert that header

915
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:16,470
which main layers headers layer 2 and

916
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:21,610
header layer 3 some people call it 2.5

917
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:24,520
layer 2.5 but anyways that's exactly

918
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:26,619
what it is you have layered layer 2 you

919
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,810
have your layer 3 between issue you have

920
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:30,910
your NPOs headers here in this case I

921
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,799
actually have two headers I have two

922
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,290
labels attached to that two numbers

923
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,050
stapled to your passwords all tell you

924
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,700
exactly why if there is a top label

925
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,440
there's a bottom label we recover that

926
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,359
very soon

927
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:47,320
so let's get a story on talking about

928
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:51,820
this network very interesting case so

929
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:54,040
what is router it's going to add low try

930
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,470
this loopback address very simple one

931
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,529
one one one advertisement OSPF why

932
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:01,600
Esaias very soon through a VFD entire

933
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,150
routing domain is going to learn about

934
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,450
it so they all eventually going to have

935
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:09,369
that but what your routers view the

936
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:11,259
intermediate routers all the routers you

937
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:14,530
have what they do is something pretty

938
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:18,490
cool these thought calling names

939
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:20,859
please start looking at your prefixes

940
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:23,049
there are you advertised and assigned

941
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:24,900
number to them this is the same exact

942
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:27,760
same concept that we just talked about

943
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,280
numbering right I received her out

944
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,560
someone put that right in OSPF I heard

945
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:37,240
about it I'm going to start calling that

946
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,759
2008 going forward my neighbors both

947
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,580
sides when you're talking to me my left

948
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,810
neighbor I'm a right neighbor I have no

949
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,460
idea about that I don't want to hear

950
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:48,100
anything about this just talk to me

951
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,490
numbers tell me 2008 whenever you tell

952
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,380
me

953
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:52,180
number two thousand eyes or can easily

954
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:56,890
tell you where you want to go what it is

955
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:58,480
I I know that I get it 100% so it starts

956
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:01,290
talking to the right neighbor says my

957
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,119
right neighbor look I'm gonna use 2008

958
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:06,700
for one on one it does the exact same

959
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:08,770
thing for the left neighbor and very

960
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,720
soon the entire network we're gonna have

961
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:13,540
bigger a go through that negotiation

962
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,209
phase and they are going to let the

963
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:18,080
neighbors know how they want to call

964
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:23,710
each one of these prefixes

965
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:27,680
that is basically the core MPLS labeling

966
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:29,750
anyone in a core or make decisions here

967
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,660
is a risk the prefixes this is what I

968
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:35,780
want to call them my neighbors this is

969
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:37,359
my assignments just FYI you're gonna

970
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,880
hear the same thing from your neighbors

971
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:42,980
after little bit of time everyone agrees

972
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,620
on what they want to call what critics

973
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,600
what number from that point on

974
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:51,200
we're going to be using numbers and not

975
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:54,440
prefixes so going back to this scenario

976
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,589
now I'm gonna use the mpls slavery and I

977
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,630
have my IP packets we push that label so

978
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:02,120
the very first router decides to just

979
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:04,850
attach it again going back to my IV it

980
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:08,930
staples that let me just attach that

981
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:12,920
number now I have number 230 or 230 I

982
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:15,830
just attached it to my packet or my

983
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,980
passport or my ID it's called the push

984
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:21,200
operation and then I send it over my

985
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:25,670
neighbor gets it swaps the number with

986
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:31,040
something gets his neighbor told him

987
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:37,520
whatever he said this guy here and again

988
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:42,160
another swap swap swap swap pop let me

989
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:47,150
go back this was not swap this is pop so

990
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:51,470
the this router here the penultimate

991
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:54,200
router here this guy here just pop the

992
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:58,310
label and he sent it over to this guy

993
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:01,189
and don't easy this function actually

994
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,630
worked you can argue that why did we

995
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:05,630
need them here us in this case to begin

996
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:08,480
with but I will show you how we can

997
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:10,520
actually add more stuff to this simple

998
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,360
case this path the path that we'll just

999
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,810
took it's called

1000
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:18,410
LSP and LSPs or label switch path these

1001
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:20,810
are one-way so you go from right to left

1002
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:22,759
left to right the hostel negotiation now

1003
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:24,500
you have to hear from your neighbors how

1004
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,840
and what they want to call it's one of

1005
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:31,900
those prefixes to form these other space

1006
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,789
so nobody cares about

1007
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,720
the payload nobody kills about headers

1008
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:39,430
anymore I am a v4 router your header is

1009
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:44,709
v6 I don't hear because I'm not looking

1010
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:47,259
at it what am i smart and you can think

1011
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:49,900
that can be anything you can have like a

1012
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:52,779
buckets of beans or nails or screws as

1013
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:56,710
long as I can process I can read the

1014
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:58,480
Incubus header we're good we're fine the

1015
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:02,349
three operations were talked about push

1016
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:07,049
off and pop it's a cool example here so

1017
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:10,630
let's say why I should let me do here I

1018
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:13,538
start my journey here Florida this is

1019
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:16,319
where I push the packets a Florida let's

1020
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:20,109
say Orlando MCO Orlando I push terror

1021
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:22,538
now this is my MPLS my mpos packet I

1022
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:26,288
send it over to Georgia Georgia does a

1023
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:29,260
swap off to Illinois another swap Kansas

1024
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:31,660
swap to Colorado swap down to Arizona

1025
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,599
swap when you get to Arizona you do a

1026
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:37,779
pop if Phoenix just take that sticker

1027
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,940
off and send it to Ryder in LAX that's

1028
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:43,299
the same story with my ID card

1029
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:46,329
my insurance country attached little

1030
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:48,190
number here the first checkpoint I do is

1031
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:50,559
swap the second checkpoint and do the

1032
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,960
swap all the way they keep swapping this

1033
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,329
the very last half before I entered the

1034
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,490
u.s. again they check this number off

1035
00:45:55,329 --> 00:46:00,250
give me one password and I go to the

1036
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:02,109
first u.s. immigration checkpoint all

1037
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,579
right surely a passcode oh yeah this

1038
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:09,609
will make sense cool

1039
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:13,450
this is exact same concept so I think by

1040
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:14,529
this point with some always simplify

1041
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:17,200
simplify

1042
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:20,500
I guess we are we should be clear on

1043
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,819
this I have more examples but the most

1044
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,170
interesting part of this session is

1045
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:24,640
actually the scenario that we're going

1046
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:26,980
to cover we're gonna use all this week

1047
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,098
I'll show you how to use all this in a

1048
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:32,799
real-world scenario so all I know just

1049
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:36,430
to summarize this we have a bunch of

1050
00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:39,190
routers in a core when we do MPLS they

1051
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:41,288
look at the prefixes advertised and they

1052
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:44,890
have a routing tables the Assam labels

1053
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:45,770
that let their neighbors know and from

1054
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:48,799
there you can use

1055
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:51,020
Tio's labels simple configuration that's

1056
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,410
a Cisco configuration juniper is just as

1057
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:57,860
simple is or it's just as simple basic

1058
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:59,450
config configuration unless you really

1059
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,190
want to tweak some features there are a

1060
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,730
lot of bells and whistles after you can

1061
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:07,670
optimize your LBP or other protocols but

1062
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:10,630
this is basically the heart of that but

1063
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:14,840
something very cool about this may be

1064
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:18,050
question that I should have asked how do

1065
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,890
we assign this how do we distribute

1066
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:22,280
these labels

1067
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:26,120
so when r3 decides for example this guy

1068
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:28,250
decides to use some label there is a

1069
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,650
protocol very simple one it's called LVP

1070
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,900
it uses LDP remember we talked about

1071
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:35,660
that negotiation with my right with my

1072
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,330
left and right neighbor that LDP is

1073
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:39,980
exactly what series we use LDP to talk

1074
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:43,850
to your neighbors and tell them about

1075
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:47,360
our decision as to the label assignment

1076
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:50,000
process I have I can say for prefixes

1077
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:52,220
and I assigned for labels of those and

1078
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,500
I'm gonna let my left and what neighbor

1079
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:59,950
know through LDP that what column labels

1080
00:47:54,500 --> 00:48:02,380
want to use so that's why MPLS core

1081
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:06,439
traffic flow let's say in this example

1082
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:09,290
left to right we used LDP everyone now

1083
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:13,370
they agreed on the same set of labels

1084
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:16,690
that's they want to use my packet starts

1085
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:22,910
traveling from R 1 to R 6 of course push

1086
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:28,370
320 swap swap swap pop that's a pen

1087
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:32,480
ultimate behavior and it might have

1088
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:35,450
worked if I had ITV's 4 but there is a

1089
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,850
bigger problem here remember that last

1090
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:40,490
segments of a network that's your core

1091
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:43,100
that's exactly where you promised your

1092
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:45,470
CTO you promised the CIO not to roll out

1093
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:48,170
miss X that's corner of a core I am NOT

1094
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:50,029
able to roll out any v6 between the 5

1095
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:53,090
and 6 that's a part of a network it has

1096
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:55,760
to remain this 4 I know you're exposing

1097
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:59,170
your v6 packet to review for part of a

1098
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:03,270
network it's going to get dropped

1099
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:06,520
right there the smart people as usual

1100
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:08,710
when they face this issue that r5 and r6

1101
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:12,390
have no idea what to do with their

1102
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:14,890
packets they decided to use two labels

1103
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:17,710
the top label is the one that we are

1104
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:19,839
using for transits the example I told

1105
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:21,880
you exactly the past for example this

1106
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,859
Vickery that every single security point

1107
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,839
they check and also there's gonna be a

1108
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:28,089
bottom label and I'm going to preserve

1109
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,009
that when I get to the last step but I

1110
00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:32,890
get to the last segments and that's

1111
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:35,020
where it's used let's look at this the

1112
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:38,348
top label here in this case is 17 the

1113
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:41,170
bottom label is 25 that's 17 label right

1114
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:44,099
that one is going to get swapped as I go

1115
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:47,859
from Florida to Georgia from Georgia to

1116
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:49,839
Illinois that's the top label it keeps

1117
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:53,160
changing keeps getting swaps where

1118
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:56,529
routers what bottom label never changes

1119
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:58,390
let's look at the example again now I

1120
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:02,020
have two labels pretty cool I have a

1121
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:05,950
bottom label promise to keep intact and

1122
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:06,670
also I have a top label soap you know

1123
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:13,210
this that's right

1124
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:15,579
three 2601 but one three five eight that

1125
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:19,329
piece the bottom label it just remains

1126
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:23,619
intact we're not touching that ten seven

1127
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:26,500
eight eight six seven still one three

1128
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:30,309
five eight is the same now let's see if

1129
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:35,109
you fix the problem with the pop look at

1130
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:38,730
this we did the pop 867 went away got

1131
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:42,279
popped out and now I have one label left

1132
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:44,920
five and six they don't have to know v6

1133
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,200
they don't have to do any v6 operation

1134
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,230
we're still relying on NPOs and they're

1135
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,799
writing the packet pretty simple basic

1136
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:56,859
logic it does work

1137
00:50:52,799 --> 00:51:00,309
so just to recap this the top label we

1138
00:50:56,859 --> 00:51:02,770
use LDP everybody in a network here all

1139
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:05,559
is routers they use LDP to tell their

1140
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:07,630
neighbors about the naval assignments

1141
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:11,540
this was the top label the easy part and

1142
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:13,580
also the bottom label every PE

1143
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:17,930
every edge of the Weiss they look at the

1144
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:20,509
ipv6 addresses assign labels to de v6

1145
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:23,960
addresses but when you have these edge

1146
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:28,160
devices and they want to assign labels

1147
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:29,780
today v6 addresses how they gonna talk

1148
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,490
to each other how are you gonna tell the

1149
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,190
other edge the other part of a network

1150
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:38,270
let's say I have one edge in Florida the

1151
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:40,070
other edge in LA how is this guy going

1152
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:43,400
to tell that one

1153
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:45,560
what sort of label decide I decided to

1154
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,540
assign at the bottom label which is the

1155
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,480
I wish is the label assigned to v6

1156
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:52,759
address there has to be a way for this

1157
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,040
router for this end of a network to talk

1158
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,410
to the other end of the network again

1159
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:01,670
that end of a network to this end of a

1160
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:06,680
network pe to PD edge to edge that this

1161
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:10,640
is the my IP assignments BGP to the

1162
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,859
rescue as usual we use BGP and we

1163
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:16,100
actually use BGP for two interesting

1164
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:19,130
purposes here one is label negotiation

1165
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:22,670
between these between these two so my

1166
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:25,820
two edge devices they use PGP he's gonna

1167
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:27,860
tell him what sort of labels he wants to

1168
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:30,380
use these are gonna be used as bottom

1169
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:33,080
labels and at the same time these are

1170
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,750
natural prefixes so BGP in this case is

1171
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:38,360
being used as a Dom truck really nothing

1172
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:40,910
more so your BGP grabs all these

1173
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,490
prefixes and all the labels labels

1174
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:45,319
included that's very cool and it's going

1175
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,759
to hold them all the way to the other

1176
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:50,600
end of the network and got dumped in

1177
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:55,310
here did on the other PE he peed look PE

1178
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:58,690
to PE one decided to assign these are

1179
00:52:55,310 --> 00:53:01,220
these labels and these are the prefixes

1180
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:03,640
Cisco configuration that's exactly how

1181
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:07,189
its configured and it's super simple

1182
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:10,400
this part see these two lines that's all

1183
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:13,670
I need trust me nothing else

1184
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:17,930
i activate my atlas family for v6 and

1185
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:20,090
also a configure send label meaning when

1186
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:22,190
you're sending updates out BGP update

1187
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:23,290
messages out make sure you send the

1188
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:26,530
labels of FM

1189
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:29,800
and I can show you how it works

1190
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:33,930
let's advertise little network in our

1191
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:38,200
riding domain and see what happens so

1192
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:42,310
it's on PE one PE one sees it now I have

1193
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:44,370
a new prefix 2031 : : 31 in Stockholm 28

1194
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:48,250
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna assign

1195
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:52,060
label number 18 to it but I have to have

1196
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:53,860
a means to talk to PE 2 sitting on the

1197
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:56,799
other side of a network and let him know

1198
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:58,420
that all I decided to use 18 and that's

1199
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,810
a prefix so don't have reachability to

1200
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:02,620
you there we go this is one of my

1201
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:07,390
favorite slides

1202
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:07,870
that's a BGP updates packets check this

1203
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,330
out

1204
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:12,759
this part you see your BGP path

1205
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:15,610
affiliates you have your origin your

1206
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,410
alias path your met your local craft

1207
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:20,620
everything else configured there now I'm

1208
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:22,180
bottom here the in Illinois part has

1209
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:26,529
something pretty cool which is the

1210
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:29,279
actual label for that prefix this is

1211
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:32,140
what PE one will be sending to PU -

1212
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,600
these are the BGP updates these are the

1213
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:37,180
routes these are the v6 routes that one

1214
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,190
end of a network is trying to share with

1215
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:41,230
the other end of the network and that's

1216
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:48,340
basically the heart of this session

1217
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:51,850
that's how it works going back to the

1218
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:54,580
same problem now going through that one

1219
00:54:51,850 --> 00:55:00,250
last time let's look at the traffic flow

1220
00:54:54,580 --> 00:55:02,560
again swap swap swap as you see the

1221
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:05,860
bottom label is not being changed at all

1222
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:07,420
we're not touching yet 18 so now the

1223
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:11,440
bottom label is still there

1224
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:13,930
we've our 500 stands MPLS or 6n

1225
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,510
theorists they have no idea about v6

1226
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:20,290
running six stars but not on that

1227
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:22,540
interface and then out that was that

1228
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:23,110
that was exactly it that's exactly how

1229
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:26,650
it works

1230
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:29,080
that was all I wanted to share as a new

1231
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:30,550
way of not a brand new way but just

1232
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:35,549
another way of looking at the problem

1233
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:37,690
and I will show you company a which is

1234
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:39,610
just the pictures company right it

1235
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:41,770
doesn't exist but let's talk about their

1236
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:44,710
case company a is a laptop manufacturer

1237
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:47,530
with 150 offices around the world out of

1238
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:49,660
150 offices 20 of the offices are

1239
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:52,210
engineering and Qi offices these are the

1240
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:54,009
offices people sit and they assemble

1241
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:57,580
laptops hard drives and everything else

1242
00:55:54,010 --> 00:56:01,030
I also 30 corporate offices they do HR

1243
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:07,569
European systems I also hired small

1244
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:09,550
sales offices and just say you know they

1245
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:14,890
also have a lot of oil tea boxes they

1246
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:19,420
might have Xbox ps4 PLC's seeks access

1247
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:22,690
robots and SCADA systems variety of

1248
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:24,580
different systems and also talking a

1249
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:26,640
little bit about their network they

1250
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:30,610
built a network several years ago and

1251
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:33,279
they use BGP of course over time they

1252
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:36,670
add advanced reflectors they have a

1253
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:40,330
multi-tier and they use pops that they

1254
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:41,920
built with me in 2012 and 2014 and the

1255
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,569
last one is a very interesting one you

1256
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,000
get that all the time the leadership

1257
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:48,630
they understand the importance of v6 but

1258
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,010
at the same time they totally respect

1259
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:52,510
availability of that network they don't

1260
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:54,070
want anyone to message that part of a

1261
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,990
network so whatever solution you're

1262
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:58,570
going to throw out make sure you won't

1263
00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:00,700
really mess a lot with the network or at

1264
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:06,880
least your hope is ensure that whatever

1265
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:10,509
you're rolling out is a stable this is

1266
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,610
the email you usually get multiple times

1267
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,260
a day hope not multiple times a day but

1268
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:16,450
multiple times a week we get that very

1269
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:19,750
often that someone wants to wrote as a

1270
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:23,799
new feature we need v6 or we need some

1271
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:27,370
other features and time long is was

1272
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:28,960
yesterday we need that and for now it's

1273
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:30,910
just one location but we're going to

1274
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,800
have more of this in the future so it's

1275
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:34,740
just a sample email that's this company

1276
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,420
for example received from the customer

1277
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:40,660
let's look at their problem it's just a

1278
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:43,060
breakdown of the situation big have a

1279
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:48,080
lot of unknown machines and all of tea

1280
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:50,220
boxes that alone kind of rules out

1281
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:54,120
machine-to-machine turn event I have

1282
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:57,330
seen people they do clients to clients

1283
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:59,759
ton range and that works but in this

1284
00:57:57,330 --> 00:58:03,390
case it's a little bit more complicated

1285
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:06,890
than that and also the deadlines they

1286
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:11,279
need it ASAP so they don't have time to

1287
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:13,589
touch every single device and change

1288
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,540
every single feature every single v4

1289
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:17,250
feature of that or majority of each

1290
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:19,680
before features of that and turn them

1291
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:21,600
into the v6 version of those it's a

1292
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,669
little bit challenging for that case and

1293
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:25,830
also vendor support they have a variety

1294
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:28,260
of different vendors when you're talking

1295
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:33,600
about when you see that and you were

1296
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:36,660
considering things like tunneling you

1297
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:39,089
have to be very careful its stability I

1298
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,609
don't want to touch the core of the

1299
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:45,030
network and I keep repeating this a lot

1300
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:47,100
and also scope can grow what the

1301
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:49,440
solution you're going to roll out you

1302
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,810
have to make sure that we can add sites

1303
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:55,470
in the future right now three sides but

1304
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:58,770
in the future might be a lot more the

1305
00:58:55,470 --> 00:59:01,350
options I think is six only sides so

1306
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:02,970
those how about this by the way let's go

1307
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:05,040
to those three sides and get rid of Lee

1308
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:07,439
for and all that Lee six don't meet it

1309
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,840
that's not really a possibility we've

1310
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,110
talked about the multiple times today

1311
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:15,860
systems are big rope walkers in most of

1312
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:19,350
these cases client-to-client tunnels

1313
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,670
doesn't really work in this case why

1314
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:22,140
because we have a lot of all your tip

1315
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:25,800
systems they have a lot of things are

1316
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:28,170
not necessarily as fancy as probably

1317
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,720
Windows or Linux machines so I saw

1318
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:32,850
tunnels that actually might work what

1319
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,140
the problem in that is remember we had

1320
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:39,120
this solution sheet be able to girl

1321
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:41,400
requirements and that's not really the

1322
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:44,100
best fit in this case dual stack

1323
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,800
everywhere that's an interesting one

1324
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:50,520
with enough time or enough time and

1325
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:53,690
enough confidence my features bondage

1326
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:57,450
drops codes security and everything

1327
00:59:53,690 --> 01:00:00,510
probably that would be an option but as

1328
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:01,509
we talked about it as we covered that's

1329
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:05,199
not

1330
01:00:01,509 --> 01:00:07,569
Sara Lee the easiest solution at least

1331
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:09,849
it's not outside of the box what else

1332
01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:13,329
this might be a job in that real

1333
01:00:09,849 --> 01:00:16,179
question what else we know okay tunnels

1334
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:18,459
yeah but how about those challenges dual

1335
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:20,769
stack everybody knows about it but what

1336
01:00:18,459 --> 01:00:24,189
else what are the other ways how can we

1337
01:00:20,769 --> 01:00:25,538
be creative in this case 6pe the

1338
01:00:24,189 --> 01:00:28,138
solution that we actually talked about

1339
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:30,519
today I think that's a great fit for

1340
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:34,149
customers like this for scenarios like

1341
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:36,788
this it's just another tool let's look

1342
01:00:34,149 --> 01:00:38,769
at the 6pe case now this customer do you

1343
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:40,659
want to use any of us in the core they

1344
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:43,269
have three sides which is great you

1345
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:45,189
don't have to have too many sites but

1346
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:47,769
that gives you the ability to increase

1347
01:00:45,189 --> 01:00:51,848
the number of sites in the future also

1348
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:54,459
it's a very it's been Tasha wood a very

1349
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:56,380
stable feature many service providers

1350
01:00:54,459 --> 01:00:59,589
the largest operators in this country

1351
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:02,199
they've been using MPLS for many years

1352
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:04,299
I'm not saying every single bar but

1353
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:07,689
majority of boards that you could

1354
01:01:04,299 --> 01:01:12,579
possibly run into there are records of

1355
01:01:07,689 --> 01:01:15,038
those box with vendors fixed or at least

1356
01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:18,189
they have workarounds for those it's a

1357
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:20,949
little bit safer than rolling out v6

1358
01:01:18,189 --> 01:01:24,939
features all of them in the core on day

1359
01:01:20,949 --> 01:01:29,259
one that MPLS thing is a little bit more

1360
01:01:24,939 --> 01:01:32,348
stable and also the learning curve now

1361
01:01:29,259 --> 01:01:35,469
that you have a v6 free core it's not

1362
01:01:32,349 --> 01:01:38,889
asleep it's takes mistakes in this case

1363
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:41,380
and not as high you are talking about in

1364
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:44,439
this particular case company a you're

1365
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,919
talking about three sites those three

1366
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:47,288
sites

1367
01:01:44,919 --> 01:01:50,288
you're all not d6 you're running into

1368
01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:53,499
issues with v6 quite honestly people

1369
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:55,239
don't know how to do things well worst

1370
01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:56,618
case scenario let me tell you the worst

1371
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:58,539
case scenario you're gonna take a

1372
01:01:56,619 --> 01:02:00,519
building down there you're gonna take a

1373
01:01:58,539 --> 01:02:03,459
site down you're gonna take a lap down

1374
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:07,359
what that's that's not okay but it's not

1375
01:02:03,459 --> 01:02:10,448
impacting the entire core so it's a

1376
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:13,449
pretty safe learning curve at least you

1377
01:02:10,449 --> 01:02:14,730
can try and you can trust small group of

1378
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:16,530
engineers because you

1379
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:18,900
touching the edges of your network not

1380
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:21,660
the core reduce the number of new

1381
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,490
features in here was bought self and LDP

1382
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:26,100
the protocol for distribution you saw

1383
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:28,799
very very few pitchers in the core

1384
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:32,060
you're actually rolling out with v6 in

1385
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:35,310
the core you have OSPF you're gonna have

1386
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:39,480
always TIV 3 you have my Esaias you're

1387
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:42,000
gonna have is is carrier v6 update it's

1388
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,210
probably different topology or maybe

1389
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:48,630
same topology and every single order

1390
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:52,350
every single feature you name it you

1391
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:54,330
have to have the v6 version of that you

1392
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:55,980
do encryption you do authentication go

1393
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:58,109
walk with it you have to configure one

1394
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:02,400
of those and you have to deal with a lot

1395
01:02:58,109 --> 01:03:05,940
of things including box but quick

1396
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:08,990
expansion is a very interesting one with

1397
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:14,340
tunnels you have to create those tunnels

1398
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:16,950
with dual stack if your dual stack is

1399
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:20,760
not everywhere you have to go to those

1400
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:22,859
parts of the core and expand your v6 to

1401
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,080
those parts of the core again you are

1402
01:03:22,859 --> 01:03:27,299
making massive changes just to add one

1403
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:29,430
more site to your existing design the

1404
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:31,740
solution that we just covered using NTFS

1405
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:33,569
labels to carry these six packets you

1406
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,310
don't have to do that you don't have to

1407
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:37,590
go to the parts of the network and say

1408
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:40,710
this part now I'm gonna be rolling out

1409
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,510
v6 features and hope it works because

1410
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:45,980
they work right there we have a new

1411
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:48,859
vendor here but it works this solution

1412
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:51,180
doesn't need it going forward

1413
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:53,279
hundred more sites hundred more

1414
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:55,230
locations you're adding to the network

1415
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,910
you're not touching your core you were

1416
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:59,070
just talking about the edges of network

1417
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:02,250
your core is going to remain intact and

1418
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:03,869
hopefully stable automation and

1419
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:07,890
monitoring whatever you've been using

1420
01:04:03,869 --> 01:04:10,290
you can keep using cuts and also because

1421
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:12,839
many service providers major vendors

1422
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:15,300
major operators they've been using em

1423
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:17,460
healers for so many years there are many

1424
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,920
many tools out there that you can take

1425
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:23,490
advantage and monitor your network once

1426
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,260
again compared to ipv6 there are many

1427
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:28,140
great tools out there for v6 what

1428
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:29,790
converts from here well smart range

1429
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:36,600
I would vote for MPLS monitoring

1430
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:42,120
features and MPLS we actually covered

1431
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:45,600
that it's been part of many codes for

1432
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:48,060
many years chances are great that your

1433
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,500
existing code in the core does support

1434
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:51,570
any of us and you don't have to make

1435
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,740
changes you don't have to reboot devices

1436
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:55,050
you don't have to go through many nice

1437
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:57,209
windows which is a great plus for many

1438
01:04:55,050 --> 01:05:00,240
components the next one is a very

1439
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:02,000
interesting one the users community when

1440
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:06,359
you look at ourselves we sitting here

1441
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,160
the number of people with MPLS backbones

1442
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,840
when you go internets and just look it

1443
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,540
up and it goes to different forms the

1444
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,520
number of people if MPLS networks it's

1445
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:17,520
far greater than number of people with

1446
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:20,340
ipv6 in the core running li6 everywhere

1447
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,110
including core of their network so you

1448
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:24,720
can get help from a much larger

1449
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:25,700
community we talked about the

1450
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,740
scalability

1451
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:32,250
this is network this is companies

1452
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:34,819
company is a network just portion of

1453
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:36,630
that this is an interesting part

1454
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:39,150
remember we talked about graphs

1455
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:42,030
reflectors with raft reflectors company

1456
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:45,600
a doesn't have to have full mesh bgp

1457
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:48,660
like this what they do is they just

1458
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:51,810
establish bgp sessions between these

1459
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:54,899
edges and also the rafts reflector same

1460
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:57,150
story exact same story i'm taking

1461
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:59,010
advantage of my rat reflectors and i'm

1462
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:01,290
not creating that full mesh mess and

1463
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:03,810
this network very very simple we can

1464
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:05,279
even have a multi-layer rafts reflector

1465
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:06,720
design you can have a Tier one grass

1466
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,280
reflectors and it's here to raster

1467
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,770
factors I don't work

1468
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,870
remember the BGP configuration all

1469
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:15,090
showed you your destination was the

1470
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:21,410
other PE in this case your destination

1471
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:24,450
is the raster flexure simple as that so

1472
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:28,500
12 the end of the session the key part

1473
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:31,500
of this session really was to understand

1474
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:34,410
this that there are ways out there that

1475
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:36,780
you can use we just need to forget about

1476
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:38,370
these walls that we built for a second

1477
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,350
and see if they can take advantage of

1478
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:41,640
those solutions bring them to our wall

1479
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,950
can apply in

1480
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,930
Kilis is not necessarily the very first

1481
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:48,500
thing that network engineers especially

1482
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:52,859
an enterprise site they think about this

1483
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:55,380
we are I hear that every day we are MPLS

1484
01:06:52,859 --> 01:07:00,410
customers and then when you ask the next

1485
01:06:55,380 --> 01:07:03,630
question what kind of MPLS dense silence

1486
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:06,029
well layer 2 layer 3 and then there are

1487
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:07,369
services out there that we use and we

1488
01:07:06,029 --> 01:07:10,769
have no idea

1489
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:12,420
b1 MPLS behind this thing there are

1490
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:14,430
point-to-point services point to point

1491
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:18,359
is actually a good example I have been

1492
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:21,058
on a conference call sales person here

1493
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:23,190
service provider engineer here on this

1494
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:25,650
side and I was listen a and he asked the

1495
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:27,390
fair question are you guys using MPLS

1496
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:29,279
anywhere in your network and the

1497
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:30,480
salesperson said no it is point-to-point

1498
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:33,869
it's not Imperial at all

1499
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:36,930
why because NPOs is expensive conceived

1500
01:07:33,869 --> 01:07:38,700
expensive right then the technical

1501
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:41,279
person the service provider saw jumped

1502
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:43,618
in and said no we actually use MP of us

1503
01:07:41,279 --> 01:07:45,420
this is just layer 2 point-to-point

1504
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:49,500
connection in the service for waterside

1505
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:51,779
so impious is if not everywhere it's a

1506
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,940
very very common technology on the

1507
01:07:51,779 --> 01:07:56,369
service for at this side I get it but

1508
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:58,680
still we can take advantage of it on the

1509
01:07:56,369 --> 01:08:00,390
interface side it gives you that in

1510
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:02,069
addition to everything just some bonus

1511
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:05,519
points it gives you traffic engineering

1512
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:06,808
so you can decide from the source and

1513
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,269
it's not signal routing it's not

1514
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:11,640
anything fancy from the source how you

1515
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:13,680
want to route your packets and what you

1516
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:15,359
want to do in case of any failure let's

1517
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:18,028
say there's a failure here in less than

1518
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:20,460
50 milliseconds I want to rat around the

1519
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:23,279
failure points and do something else or

1520
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:24,630
you know what's very important traffic

1521
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,299
in my voice traffic this way

1522
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:28,650
one ipv6 traffic the other way it gives

1523
01:08:27,299 --> 01:08:31,229
you this ability as well

1524
01:08:28,649 --> 01:08:34,408
I'm also fast throughout we talked about

1525
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:37,799
the convergence thing so overall that's

1526
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:42,210
a great feature and I believe it works

1527
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:44,969
for many organizations and something

1528
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:47,189
that's new sewing company pays case I

1529
01:08:44,969 --> 01:08:50,540
would like to kind of highlight here is

1530
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:54,149
if you have verbs

1531
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:56,700
vrf in a USB user pronounced over

1532
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:57,809
in Europe people say vrf and it's not

1533
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:01,889
very flattered

1534
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:10,860
anyways so vrf or segmentation rat

1535
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:13,950
segmentation 6pe can be developed as 6

1536
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:15,809
vp e and 6 vp e is the right solution

1537
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:19,429
for those cases very very similar to

1538
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:22,890
this one and you can have vrf sundae on

1539
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:24,990
both sides of the network v RF 2 v RF

1540
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:27,180
conversation you can later expand this

1541
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:29,729
to customer to customer conversation

1542
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:33,020
customer a wants to have connectivity v6

1543
01:09:29,729 --> 01:09:36,569
connectivity and you can provide that

1544
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:39,060
and that could be actually very

1545
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:42,689
interesting session we talked about a

1546
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:44,460
couple of amazing points that could be

1547
01:09:42,689 --> 01:09:47,099
future sessions one of them is the sixth

1548
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:49,410
vp e the other one was that industrial

1549
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:52,200
systems and how to secure industrial

1550
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:55,830
networks and how to tear that wall but

1551
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:57,570
tear down war between our world i keep

1552
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:59,850
saying our old it's aria the entire

1553
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:01,679
thing is our world anyways network

1554
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:03,900
engineering world and industrial systems

1555
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:06,930
are all your tools that could be another

1556
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:10,009
interesting session so the key takeaway

1557
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:14,280
in this case 6b is just another tool you

1558
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:17,220
know tunnel ink a lot of different ways

1559
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:19,530
to tunnel your new dual stack and i'm

1560
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:22,020
sure many people here to try dual stack

1561
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:24,059
but just keep in mind just backup minds

1562
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:27,150
of the future there is also a

1563
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:29,580
possibility to have very simple lite

1564
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:33,210
version just a stripped-down version of

1565
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:36,930
a MPLS roll that new network that's been

1566
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:39,600
around for many years tested by largest

1567
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:42,990
operators in the contrary and on top of

1568
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:45,360
that starts rolling out this x it's not

1569
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:47,010
a full migration to this X it's not your

1570
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:51,179
I'm gonna give you this X in the future

1571
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:54,000
but any time it takes let's say 10 years

1572
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:56,190
15 years and I'm sure just looking

1573
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,020
around the room I think by the time all

1574
01:10:56,190 --> 01:11:03,870
of us is higher we're still gonna have

1575
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:06,570
before some parts of before yeah I like

1576
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:07,840
this much so yes

1577
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:12,250
by the time we get to

1578
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:14,200
points this solution can work I am not

1579
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:16,960
sure about tunnelling as you change your

1580
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:19,540
codes then there's some platforms and I

1581
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:22,540
don't personally want to deal with dual

1582
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:25,269
stuck in a core what this thing can get

1583
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:27,730
you through the next decade or so until

1584
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:29,890
we have these sex everywhere and I think

1585
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:34,900
that's a great solution we're done with

1586
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:39,630
this I'll open this questions any

1587
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:48,490
questions we have some 17 minutes left

1588
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:51,670
cool please this is Prabhu this so when

1589
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:57,309
we do tiling on ipv6 over MPLS the

1590
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:59,080
egress point the label doesn't make any

1591
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:01,360
sense anyway we are going to strip out

1592
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:04,150
the label and do a look-up on ipv6 again

1593
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:05,980
so in that case why the ingress have to

1594
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:10,120
push different labels it can be a unique

1595
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:10,950
label to only write who did just repeat

1596
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:14,590
the last part

1597
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:16,300
so the ingress is pushing one label

1598
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:18,490
through the ingress pushes the Lego on

1599
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:20,980
yes yes and there is a transport label

1600
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:23,410
so correct sir two labels right so the

1601
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:26,889
transport label gets swap and each and

1602
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:29,080
every point I won't go to the PHP the

1603
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:31,300
transport label is stripped off and the

1604
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:34,180
top layer the bottom label goes to the

1605
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:36,820
egress right that's right now anyway the

1606
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:39,430
egress point has to just drop the label

1607
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:42,370
and do a lookup on ipv6 right correct

1608
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:46,090
and it was understand ipv6 right so in

1609
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:48,340
that case why the ingress has to use

1610
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:51,400
different labels as a bottom rebel just

1611
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:52,930
one unique label because should be out

1612
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,460
enough right i phone a sonic question

1613
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:57,070
correctly before because of that last

1614
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:58,840
segments that slack segments between

1615
01:12:57,070 --> 01:13:01,990
europe and ultimate hop and the ultimate

1616
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:03,760
hop that part is not v6 you do not have

1617
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:06,700
this I understand that what I'm asking

1618
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:09,370
is on the egress you receive with a

1619
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:11,920
label and an ipv6 what are you going to

1620
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:15,300
do with that label just drop it and do a

1621
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:18,610
lookup on ipv6 right yes so that case

1622
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:19,260
for the entire router for all the bgp

1623
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:24,540
prefix

1624
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:27,060
one unique ipv6 the bottom label should

1625
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:29,850
be good enough right no because you have

1626
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:32,190
because the way it works is for every

1627
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:34,230
single prefix you're gonna have a

1628
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:37,049
different label and it points to that

1629
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:39,419
prefix and also you might have your apps

1630
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:41,190
and it knows where to place that packets

1631
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:44,160
no I'm not talking about the we are of

1632
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:47,129
plain BGP so all the BGP routes go to

1633
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:50,099
the final box yeah let's say with

1634
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:51,780
hundred different labels all the hundred

1635
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,160
labels are just going to be dropped and

1636
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:56,130
anyway you're going to do a look-up on

1637
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:58,080
ipv6 packet so instead of hundred

1638
01:13:56,130 --> 01:14:00,750
different labels you can just use label

1639
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,970
to explicitly but that's good enough for

1640
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:07,620
the egress node to just drop the label

1641
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:08,910
to and do a look-up on ipv6 I see what

1642
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:11,460
you're saying

1643
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:13,530
that's that might work I may not work in

1644
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:15,630
some cases I'm thinking of some low

1645
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:18,570
balancing cases now maybe for VPN it's

1646
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:20,489
different for a plane absolutely writes

1647
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:23,309
you rights for a different simple use

1648
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:25,230
case of BGP all the English order can

1649
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:27,380
just put label too that's good enough

1650
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:30,900
right you don't have multiple deities

1651
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:32,460
how it gets from the penultimate hop to

1652
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,389
the last one that's good enough right I

1653
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:37,050
see your point

1654
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:39,989
thank you thank you another interesting

1655
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:42,900
question Natalie asks the outs along the

1656
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:44,519
same lines that some people ask is part

1657
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:48,210
of a lecture we're always talking about

1658
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:51,840
I actually use the word almost the 95

1659
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:54,420
percent of cases we don't care about the

1660
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,850
headers there actually are three headers

1661
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:59,820
not necessary that last segment but also

1662
01:14:56,850 --> 01:15:02,100
everywhere there is that small very

1663
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:03,690
small percentage doctor routers they do

1664
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:07,560
care about to what is going on in

1665
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:09,450
addition to your labels cases like load

1666
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:11,550
balancing they will just pick through

1667
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:14,849
have a quick look and see what's going

1668
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:18,060
on what's for the majority of cases 95

1669
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:20,910
whatever 99% of cases the only lawyer in

1670
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:25,310
on labels and you don't care about what

1671
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:28,309
headers you have yeah in other questions

1672
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:28,310
please

1673
01:15:32,469 --> 01:15:37,150
hello all artists a limit Facebook I

1674
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:41,079
guess I have a similar question because

1675
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:44,348
my understanding is you can eliminate

1676
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:46,420
the penultimate hop behavior absolutely

1677
01:15:44,349 --> 01:15:48,789
when you advertise the explicit novel by

1678
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:51,190
putting a label option so wouldn't that

1679
01:15:48,789 --> 01:15:54,820
be a trade off as opposed to using two

1680
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:57,428
labels like label stacking it's it is

1681
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:59,768
possible it's absolutely possible yes

1682
01:15:57,429 --> 01:16:01,599
you can turn that behavior off and you

1683
01:15:59,769 --> 01:16:02,800
can keep that label on and that's very

1684
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:05,590
helpful if you're trying to be

1685
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,179
quality-of-service end to end yes so so

1686
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:10,630
there's the absolutely possible your

1687
01:16:07,179 --> 01:16:12,519
chronicles on right okay yeah and the

1688
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:15,219
use case the quality of service use case

1689
01:16:12,519 --> 01:16:19,269
is actually one of the big reasons there

1690
01:16:15,219 --> 01:16:21,519
is one little use case super corner use

1691
01:16:19,269 --> 01:16:24,309
case you're not gonna do that you're not

1692
01:16:21,519 --> 01:16:29,289
gonna see that anywhere but it's

1693
01:16:24,309 --> 01:16:34,420
possible to use a routing protocol that

1694
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:36,940
is not linked states in the core with

1695
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:39,010
that feature but keeping that label and

1696
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:40,388
helping your routing protocol I don't

1697
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:42,579
want to make this complicated we can

1698
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:45,579
talk outside but there is that point

1699
01:16:42,579 --> 01:16:46,808
zero zero one percent of cases that

1700
01:16:45,579 --> 01:16:49,900
somebody wants to do something

1701
01:16:46,809 --> 01:16:51,909
absolutely crazy no crying I'm on île

1702
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:57,070
directly for traffic engineering core

1703
01:16:51,909 --> 01:17:01,449
with MPLS it's not impossible there is

1704
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:03,489
that 0.001 percent possibility and you

1705
01:17:01,449 --> 01:17:06,190
can keep that label I take advantage

1706
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:08,678
shorts have you seen any trade offs or

1707
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:11,110
any use cases where there are some like

1708
01:17:08,679 --> 01:17:14,260
things to consider in terms of I guess

1709
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:15,999
I'm I'm trying to understand why or if

1710
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:18,039
they're use cases where people tend to

1711
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:20,349
do that more as opposed to stacking the

1712
01:17:18,039 --> 01:17:22,869
labels and using two labels map is in

1713
01:17:20,349 --> 01:17:24,639
memory constraint things like a question

1714
01:17:22,869 --> 01:17:27,610
for you are you talking about my size

1715
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:30,940
versus always spirit or oversize there's

1716
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:32,978
a European I would say like more of the

1717
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:34,659
IGP not mattering just more of like the

1718
01:17:32,979 --> 01:17:40,869
trade-offs between stacking the labels

1719
01:17:34,659 --> 01:17:42,909
versus behavior yeah so I don't want to

1720
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:44,848
turn this into an TL Centocor session

1721
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:46,989
but real quick answer

1722
01:17:44,849 --> 01:17:47,980
forget let's forget about your talking

1723
01:17:46,989 --> 01:17:49,718
for a second Ryan

1724
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:52,388
that's that point zero zero one percent

1725
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:54,190
if somebody really real challenges you

1726
01:17:52,389 --> 01:17:56,590
it's a job in your video can I use your

1727
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:59,678
P MPLS traffic engineering in a court

1728
01:17:56,590 --> 01:18:01,360
yes you can it's not great that's not

1729
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,690
something that people do but it's not

1730
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:06,909
impossible it's absolutely possible

1731
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:09,009
quick answers back but always fear fan

1732
01:18:06,909 --> 01:18:11,110
eius eius that's one of the great

1733
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:13,119
questions that differences in the core

1734
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:15,699
and sometimes they give religious people

1735
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:18,790
we've been using this for 150 years they

1736
01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:20,440
are sorta stable but beyond all this

1737
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:23,909
conversations there are some subtle

1738
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:29,860
differences one example here is European

1739
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:34,509
honest eyes updates the new TL is that

1740
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:38,380
we added two eius eius for eius eius te

1741
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:41,590
updates compared to the l essays that we

1742
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:44,710
added OSPF there is a big difference the

1743
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:46,929
differences if always with oil science

1744
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:49,719
you increase the number of updates it

1745
01:18:46,929 --> 01:18:50,909
always be a few back and send out so in

1746
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:54,940
that sense

1747
01:18:50,909 --> 01:18:57,909
OSPF can want always fear of Te router

1748
01:18:54,940 --> 01:19:01,419
can be a little bit more efficient what

1749
01:18:57,909 --> 01:19:04,330
Keeton wants OSPF updates now going to

1750
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:07,239
die a sinusoid in our size favor you can

1751
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:10,739
tweak your size timers for the riders to

1752
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:15,098
be quiet for eighteen point two hours

1753
01:19:10,739 --> 01:19:18,280
absolutely quiet OSPF you have this more

1754
01:19:15,099 --> 01:19:20,409
tank you have to keep refreshing your

1755
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:24,250
database that's what is networks terms

1756
01:19:20,409 --> 01:19:26,138
of a tend to be most more stable a bit

1757
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:28,090
more quiet so there are those

1758
01:19:26,139 --> 01:19:31,840
differences out there absolutely

1759
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:34,929
there are APIs and writes and in this

1760
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:38,170
context if I Esaias we have multi

1761
01:19:34,929 --> 01:19:40,030
topology and single topology we can talk

1762
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:41,800
about different vendors what that gives

1763
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:43,360
you that gives you a lot of ability how

1764
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,429
to design your network do I have to do

1765
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,500
everything overnight or I can do motors

1766
01:19:45,429 --> 01:19:50,349
policy and decide how I want to roll

1767
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:54,130
this out I want to do v6 this part of a

1768
01:19:50,349 --> 01:19:55,869
network I'm gonna do multi apology and

1769
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:56,720
then take my time and upgrade the

1770
01:19:55,869 --> 01:19:59,000
network as need

1771
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:01,880
get the wispy of the stories a little

1772
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,030
difference because OSPF III is a whole

1773
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:08,390
different protocol it has its own world

1774
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:10,880
and LSAs and everything much better much

1775
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:13,190
more efficient I like it but that's a

1776
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,810
different protocol if I sighs say first

1777
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:24,320
of all you can have different apologies

1778
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:26,480
okay thank thanks for asking hey I'm a

1779
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,200
aaron with exelon I did have a question

1780
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,299
sorry

1781
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:32,240
sure yeah you laid out a great case for

1782
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:34,670
using MPLS instead of using dual stack

1783
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:37,010
are there any arguments or any alternate

1784
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:40,630
or I guess benefits to using the dual

1785
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:43,600
stack approach quite honestly yes

1786
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:47,780
absolutely and that's a great question

1787
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:50,420
MPLS you can make the argument and say

1788
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:53,030
the time that it takes for my NOC to be

1789
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:55,790
able to troubleshoot MPLS networks and

1790
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:57,170
why not be able to understand it MPLS

1791
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:59,780
inside-out

1792
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:02,090
since it's a service provider technology

1793
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:04,700
given what's going on out during a

1794
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:06,770
training market it's harder

1795
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:08,150
most people here when do you start in

1796
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:09,740
network engineering track and it's a

1797
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:13,219
real-world problem I'm dealing with on a

1798
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:15,889
daily basis people start this either a

1799
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:18,020
Cisco or juniper they learn this X this

1800
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:19,970
X is part of the curriculum I mean even

1801
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:22,160
the basic ones right the NOC people that

1802
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:25,070
we hire they understand basics of these

1803
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:28,430
X I didn't lie when I said six months

1804
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:30,950
but it's not really six months because

1805
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:34,220
most people know basics of it 36 that's

1806
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:36,440
not the case of an MPLS MPLS scares

1807
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:39,290
people when you start talking about MPLS

1808
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:41,750
okay if not people how many people here

1809
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:44,210
you have amperes experience we hire

1810
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:45,680
people from service providers and the

1811
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:48,530
gentleman that we hired he never

1812
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:50,330
actually configured in POS they would

1813
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:52,820
run a bunch of commands and send it to

1814
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:55,250
the next year and then the next year so

1815
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:58,429
MPLS from a training learning curves

1816
01:21:55,250 --> 01:22:02,120
perspective unfortunately isn't it is in

1817
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:04,040
a little bit of Spanish but still given

1818
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:06,860
all everything that we talked about

1819
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:09,159
I am also personally MPOs in the core

1820
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:11,739
but again it's

1821
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:14,379
your organization's preference you

1822
01:22:11,739 --> 01:22:17,500
definitely don't want to send everyone

1823
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:19,510
through a training for MPOs just to see

1824
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,219
you guys we're gonna be connecting three

1825
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:23,350
sides

1826
01:22:20,219 --> 01:22:26,350
most people know basics of b6 these days

1827
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:29,949
probably I would have had a different

1828
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:31,120
conversation five years ago v6 was not

1829
01:22:29,949 --> 01:22:33,460
part of training

1830
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:35,679
many organizations but today most people

1831
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:39,310
even fresh kids out cuz you only hire

1832
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:42,250
them they know basics on and ipv6 that's

1833
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:43,000
not the case of an MPLS yeah thank you

1834
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:46,929
sure yeah

1835
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:53,409
we see that all the time yeah any other

1836
01:22:46,929 --> 01:22:55,890
questions oh cool thank you so much for

1837
01:22:53,409 --> 01:23:00,429
your time thanks for joining us today

1838
01:22:55,890 --> 01:23:00,429
[Applause]

1839
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,860
