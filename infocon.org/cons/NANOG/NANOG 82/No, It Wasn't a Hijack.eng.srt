[Music]

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,080
hello everyone and this is after

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,639
i work for internet society as part of

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,440
the

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,440
manners team so today we will be

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,800
talking about a small observation i have

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,760
seen

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,439
in last few years so i just wanted to

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,519
share with everyone that

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,640
why this benign problem can create a

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,119
bigger issue uh moving forward

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,680
so the topic is it wasn't a hijack so

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,880
let's see what

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
wasn't a hijack um if you're joining

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,719
this session

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
i am i'm pretty sure it's not new to you

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,520
that there is a problem with the bgp

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,200
and the problem is that people don't

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
secure it properly it's not that the bgp

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,719
inherently is insecure

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,840
there are measures available but uh

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
uh network operators don't put those

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,039
measures

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,160
in place to make it secure

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,640
attacks can take anywhere from hours to

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,000
months or

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,760
to even be identified and a statement we

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,159
use

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,000
quite regularly is called fat fingers or

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,520
inheritance errors

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,360
which can make network offline

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,560
so these this is the data um we gather

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,040
from

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,119
uh bgpstream.com uh which is now cisco

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,360
uh owned by cisco now um into 2020 bgp

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,799
stream collectors around the world

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,000
uh identified uh more than 2000

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,560
events termed as possible hijacks you

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,119
can see

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,240
two high-rises these are very well known

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,560
uh

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,399
incidents and if you look at the bgp

43
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,240
leaks in 2020

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,360
most of the year they were not that many

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,960
of course looking at the size of the

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,680
pgp or the routing table at the moment

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
you can consider this as not that many

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,119
but there are a few high rises as

49
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,000
compared to the whole year

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
if you combine them both uh you can

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,280
literally see there

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,720
there were incidents on every day

53
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,920
from bgp leads or the bgp hijack

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
um and you if you come check it with

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,200
2019 incidents and 2020 incidents

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,879
well um things are not getting better

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,360
yes 2030 insulin doesn't make a lot of

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,760
impact if they are not propagated

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,480
globally

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
or if it's just a one prefix or two

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,480
prefix

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,440
but the incident happens which shows

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,000
that there

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
are there are networks in the

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,640
middle of the internet that not doing

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,760
the

67
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
route filtering uh properly

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
so this is a typical route hijack looks

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360
like

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,239
i am old enough to remember the most

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,120
famous

72
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
2008 youtube hijack done by the pakistan

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,879
telecom

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,159
uh i think that was the time

75
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,840
when everybody realized that now we have

76
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,440
to fix it um

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,879
and now things have changed but still uh

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
not everything has changed so let's talk

79
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,040
about the

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,159
um inadvertence errors or

81
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,599
in our uh technical terms we call it fat

82
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,560
fingers as uh most of the time

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,480
these are just a human error so you're

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,920
trying to type something and

85
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
uh accidentally you have typed something

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,959
different right

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,159
um and it happens all the time

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,280
uh it's not like uh it is uh intentional

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,319
of course it's not

90
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,440
uh but we can avoid them by

91
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
doing few things we'll discuss it at the

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,879
end but let's

93
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,480
talk about the incidents first so

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,760
for example um a network operator wanted

95
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,400
to do

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,959
um bgp prepend as repent

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
and their as number was 59356

98
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,879
well in a hurry they were trying to type

99
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
something and they typed in

100
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,640
five nine three six five once and then

101
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
five nine three five ones

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,840
both of them uh were accepted by

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,519
uh accepted by the command and there's

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,560
nothing wrong with the

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
command for them uh for for the for the

106
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,399
vgp it is just

107
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,519
a number that they they are not

108
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,400
intelligently looking at the what as you

109
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,960
own

110
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,400
so they are just gonna put those numbers

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,000
in and start announcing the prefixes

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
alongside your os number and the prepend

113
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,560
you are trying to do

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,520
same is the case is on the right side is

115
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,080
37129 is your

116
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
s number um and then you started doing

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
seven as the aspen on the left side it

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,680
makes a lot of sense that somebody

119
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,560
actually did a mistake but on the right

120
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,040
side

121
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,800
well it doesn't make any sense three

122
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,240
seven one two line

123
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,160
and then seven um as the as prepend

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
uh is is not a very intentional mistake

125
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
or unintentional mistake

126
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,520
so that was a bit uh strange for me

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,160
anyway like every network operator or a

128
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,520
network engineer

129
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,560
um i shared these things on

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,759
the twitter and our very own friend doug

131
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,720
midori raised

132
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
a very valid point at that point at that

133
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,919
time that

134
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,160
where this is very common uh for a

135
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
single digit as number

136
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,039
and he pointed out uh towards a like the

137
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,160
old blog post from

138
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,520
uh 2013 by anurag saying he

139
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,199
did mention that about the single digit

140
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,479
base number and that triggered a

141
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,800
uh i would say a rabbit hole for me that

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,479
i started looking at the data

143
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,520
since 2013 um that

144
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,720
how much problem

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,319
exists with single-digit as number

146
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
so i didn't uh go further up to

147
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
2018 because i was looking at the data

148
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,199
it's like that's too much information

149
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,000
let's stick to

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,400
a couple of years so in 2018 1920

151
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,639
and of course the remaining of the 2020

152
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,080
um

153
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,280
i looked up bgp streaming data and see

154
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,479
uh if the single digit or 1 to 10 a.s

155
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,240
number

156
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,880
were present in the announcement or the

157
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,680
origin

158
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
of any announcement of course they do

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,000
announce uh some prefixes but

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
you can literally see if they it's been

161
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,240
used as uh

162
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
as prepared or not so you can see the

163
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
numbers uh

164
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,280
it's growing uh well the size of the

165
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,960
table is growing the number of networks

166
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
we are adding

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
like around 3 000 every year or

168
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
something so

169
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,680
um of course it's it's growing quite

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,639
rapidly

171
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,919
so as the number of incidents

172
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,280
um if you look at uh the spread of um

173
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,639
as1 to 10 in 2018 um

174
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,800
they were all over the place as2 was the

175
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,240
biggest as7 and

176
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,919
uh six were uh the next and the as3

177
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,280
so these are the as number originating

178
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,440
the prefixes they are not supposed to

179
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,280
right so apparently

180
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,120
these as numbers were hijacking prefixes

181
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,199
they were not and i'll explain to you

182
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,360
why they are not

183
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
so these are the numbers again um

184
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,639
the prefix is the as number in the

185
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,639
middle uh are the origin

186
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,680
are the orange legitimate owner um

187
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,840
or the custodian or the prefixes they

188
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,280
were announcing

189
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,880
but all of a sudden as1 or as2 started

190
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,759
originating these prefixes of course but

191
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,800
it were they were

192
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
still propagating through the

193
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,879
original as number so

194
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,199
this is from 2019 um all of a sudden

195
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,599
as1234 four

196
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,520
one two three five um are now the

197
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,639
dominant ones and as10 are still there

198
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,800
you can see at the at the end there are

199
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,319
some uh

200
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
again some unique numbers which clearly

201
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,960
shows that these are the lab

202
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,639
announcements which leaked out to the

203
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
internet uh because

204
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,319
of course once you connect your lab

205
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,160
environment to the live internet

206
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,960
uh it will go out somehow so you can see

207
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,000
there there are

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
uh other numbers as well but we are

209
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,120
focusing right now

210
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,360
at the es number between one to ten

211
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,080
again these are the uh cases here um

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,719
one as11113 one one two were detected

213
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,399
these are very common um asmr

214
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,160
which you might have used in your lab

215
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,360
so if you are doing it still

216
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
well there is a big chunk of privacy

217
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,959
somewhere you can use them

218
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,760
uh or if you are still want to use these

219
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
imaginary as number just remember

220
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,160
uh they are allocated most likely they

221
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,839
are allocated to somebody else

222
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,760
or if they are free still they are

223
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,720
considered as hijacked

224
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
now um again moving into other unique as

225
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,800
number

226
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,480
um these are uh if you look at this one

227
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,160
expected yes number was

228
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
two three times zero and then two two

229
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,560
um and then whoever was doing the is

230
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,360
prepend

231
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,320
they did two four times zero and two two

232
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
again this is a very

233
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,240
uh i would consider as a very genuine

234
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
mistake right

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
not the other one like if you are doing

236
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
um that many times

237
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,720
triple one then of course it is coming

238
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,680
from your

239
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,880
uh uh lab and

240
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,279
as the as number such as name suggests

241
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
that it's experimental computing

242
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
facility in u.s so definitely they were

243
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,399
doing some experimentation

244
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,519
going forward into 2020 you can see the

245
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,120
as1 and as2

246
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,440
are now increasing so there are 12

247
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
incidents uh recorded by vgp stream uh

248
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,040
or

249
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,640
each for as1 and as2 and for as5

250
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,120
their number of eight well you can see

251
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,000
that um

252
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,560
while doing the aspen most of the time

253
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
people use

254
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,240
do at least one yes prepend or

255
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
twice so that's why it is showing up

256
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,399
in this list of incidents sometimes

257
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,480
people do

258
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,120
as prepend ten times uh well there is

259
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,760
another

260
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,480
uh research by doug midori uh who looked

261
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
into the

262
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,000
the length of the aspen and it's

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,360
sometimes uh

264
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,040
it's extraordinary how many times you

265
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,720
could prepend just to

266
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,839
do the traffic engineering

267
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,160
so again the list is uh going

268
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,399
wide and broad in in terms of what

269
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,640
people are using in terms of prepend

270
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,240
this uh these this case is quite unique

271
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,440
right so

272
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,720
in a very small period of time uh

273
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,360
you can check the data from the right

274
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,200
wrist

275
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,360
the screenshot from there that

276
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,120
one three five one seven one uh started

277
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,560
prepending with one

278
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
then with two with with four and then

279
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
ultimately with ten

280
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,720
apparently whatever they were doing was

281
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,079
not working

282
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,240
because they were doing it incorrectly

283
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,000
that's why it was not working

284
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,800
so um you can have a look at that at the

285
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
end they actually managed to fix it

286
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,920
so here you can see they started

287
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,200
prepending it

288
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,839
properly so if if we count it it's like

289
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,560
one

290
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,600
two three four five six seven eight

291
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,800
nine ten so they managed to do it

292
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,279
like this uh for traffic engineering for

293
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,440
sure

294
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,800
again um in if you calculate

295
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,160
the total number from 2018 to 2021

296
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,839
uh as2 and as1 are

297
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,880
the dominant ones and as5

298
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,760
again is there as well so

299
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,880
and it's i looked up this information um

300
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,079
on

301
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,200
12th of april and

302
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,480
you can go and use the regular regular

303
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,000
expression on bgp

304
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,760
and see for all as numbers starting from

305
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,160
1

306
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,880
to 10 and see who's announcing what so

307
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,600
you can see

308
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,279
um as1 is announcing uh all these

309
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,720
prefixes they are not supposed to um

310
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,760
and then you can also have a look at as2

311
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,639
so on and so forth for uh all other as

312
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,600
numbers

313
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
um so the the if

314
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
if you look at this number you'll see

315
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,279
that uh why they are announcing them

316
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,480
uh and they and it's of course

317
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,959
most likely these prefixes are gone uh

318
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,120
but you will see other prefixes uh

319
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,959
and by other as number as their peers

320
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,639
but if the problem is not going away

321
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,600
the problem is still exist and as of

322
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,760
today that's what i'm trying to say

323
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,800
and it is uh it

324
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
we need to understand why this is

325
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,399
happening

326
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,320
so here is the reason why it is

327
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,839
happening that is my

328
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,079
strong belief that this is why it is

329
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,360
happening

330
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,399
uh i i would say allegedly it's because

331
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,760
i cannot prove it that

332
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,560
all the incident happened um uh in the

333
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,760
last three four five

334
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,800
ten years but because of this so

335
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
we all use a very nice product called

336
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
microtech

337
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
they're the routing operating system

338
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,160
they use is

339
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,839
router os right um and they

340
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,040
uh they use of course they provide

341
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,639
uh they have a very strong bgp

342
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,320
implementation um

343
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,839
and while offering the bgp uh they offer

344
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,160
you two things um

345
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,440
which is as part prepend

346
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,880
but there are two ways you can do aspen

347
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,120
using router os number one is you can

348
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
set bgp prepend

349
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,880
which is how many times to prepend

350
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,399
router's own as number if my as number

351
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,720
is 139038 which is my

352
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,480
my as number anyway it is asking me

353
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,199
how many times to prepare router's own

354
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,160
as number

355
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
so this is a number right so

356
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,920
as it explains in the uh uh uh

357
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,639
in their reference command reference

358
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,120
that

359
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
it is an integer they are expecting that

360
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,560
how many times you want to add your own

361
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
as number

362
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
so if i set two it means they will add

363
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,800
my

364
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,079
as number along with my original

365
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,240
announcement so this is still my as

366
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
number

367
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,160
now the second command is set bgp

368
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,160
prepend dash path

369
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,959
now this is the problem add a specified

370
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,600
list of

371
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,519
as number to the aspart

372
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,160
if both said bgp prepared and said bgp

373
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,320
prepend path are used then

374
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,360
the first one will get the highest

375
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,720
priority

376
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,440
so what is happening is most likely

377
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,399
network engineers are using the second

378
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
command

379
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,839
which is prepend path

380
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,079
using the integer value

381
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,600
of the first command so if i say set bgp

382
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,839
prepend part

383
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,079
and give one expecting that it will add

384
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,000
one to uh it will add uh my as number

385
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,920
one more time it will not it will add

386
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,279
one as the as path or region and this is

387
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:05,759
where

388
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,120
i believe and allegedly that the problem

389
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,800
exists it is

390
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,320
just lack of understanding i would say

391
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,279
or just

392
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,519
not looking at the details that how

393
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,120
these two commands are

394
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,680
implemented and i wouldn't blame people

395
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,480
because

396
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,199
if you look at the syntax it's very very

397
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,079
same

398
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,079
so what should we call it uh it's just a

399
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,320
as prepend hijacked

400
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,759
a microtech depend hijack or something

401
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,720
else or it's just

402
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,920
a configuration mistake uh which is

403
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,120
causing these problems uh uh to

404
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,240
the global routing table and you can

405
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
you just saw that that it's still

406
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,519
happening so it's not like that it used

407
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,000
to happen

408
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and now we have fixed it magically it's

409
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,120
not

410
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,720
so uh a couple of lessons

411
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,759
right uh filtering as number is

412
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,040
as important as prefix filtering so we

413
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
put a lot of emphasis

414
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,280
on uh oh you should filter your

415
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,000
customers

416
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,640
right uh your downstream customers uh

417
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,839
all the time that

418
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,520
it is for the network operators or the

419
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,280
internet service providers that you

420
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,000
should

421
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,599
uh always filter prefixes right

422
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,720
but a lot of network operators and the

423
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,520
reason why

424
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,919
uh these you can see all these

425
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,720
propagations

426
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,120
is because uh network operators are not

427
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,799
filtering the as numbers and that's why

428
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,960
the as numbers are

429
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
propagating all across the global

430
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,520
routing table

431
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,720
and the second lesson i would say should

432
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,360
be for

433
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,440
all of us is create filters before

434
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,840
configuring

435
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
neighbors you don't

436
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,039
start your configuration um as

437
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,760
if it is not a live network so it is a

438
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,960
live network don't

439
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
do don't go ahead and start doing the

440
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
configuration make

441
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,840
sure that put the filters in place first

442
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,400
before you do anything practice with

443
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,360
regular expression

444
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,160
um of course it's it's it's complicated

445
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,799
um

446
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,720
it's it's boring uh to be fair

447
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,760
um but it helps you understand a lot of

448
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,160
problem

449
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,840
try to avoid uh unnecessary prepend um

450
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
there are other ways you can do traffic

451
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
engineering you don't have to rely

452
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,400
on the

453
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,760
as prepend only test in the lab

454
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,480
environment

455
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,240
uh you don't you don't have to

456
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,600
necessarily uh

457
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,320
start doing it on the live network as

458
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,520
well

459
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,240
uh for example if you have done the

460
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,520
router os testing

461
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,600
in the lab you you must have learned

462
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
that there is a problem

463
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,559
talk to other members of the community

464
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,480
for help if you're using a new routing

465
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,280
operating system

466
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,640
um they probably can help you with this

467
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
the data shows how easy it is to hijack

468
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
an s number

469
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,320
and remain undetected so

470
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,360
if any operating any detection mechanism

471
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,559
you're using

472
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,280
what they're gonna say is as1 has

473
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,039
hijacked these prefixes

474
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,400
or as2 has hijacked these prefixes as1

475
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,640
and as2 has actually no idea that

476
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,720
they are hijacking anything because they

477
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
are not uh it is the

478
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,799
other as number which just made a

479
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,200
mistake and now announcing these

480
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,720
uh prefixes with a wrong region

481
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,000
but if you combine this with a

482
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,360
asn plus prefix hijacks it will

483
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,240
make roa which is about origin

484
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,000
authorization useless

485
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,039
uh the reason is that now you have

486
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,160
uh because what rpk but what

487
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,200
uh roa tells you that um who is the

488
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,600
rightful

489
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,880
owner or the custodian of this prefix

490
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
you already have the as number you just

491
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,799
have to start announcing the prefix of

492
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,559
those s numbers

493
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,200
um and then you have a perfect hijack

494
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,880
with a perfect row

495
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,360
so this is a big problem it can be a big

496
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,799
problem

497
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,200
and we have seen it couple of times so

498
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,039
we have to make sure that we are not

499
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,240
only filtering on the basis of

500
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,720
roars which is round origin validation

501
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,559
we also doing the traditional

502
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,919
filterings for example looking at what

503
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,559
the customer your downstream customer

504
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,520
are

505
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,640
able to announce in terms of prefix

506
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,760
as well as asm once you have that in

507
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,159
place

508
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,960
alongside without origin validation then

509
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,080
we can say we are

510
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,640
doing our best to protect the routing

511
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,159
table

512
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,480
and as part of the manners initiative

513
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,919
this is what we recommend

514
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,200
we we tell you that do the filtering

515
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,240
as well as the global validation uh

516
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,919
so if you combine them both then it will

517
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,360
help secure the routing uh

518
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,559
we rely on for the internet um if you

519
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,400
look at the details in the manage action

520
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,600
you will find all the

521
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,440
uh implementation guide as well we have

522
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
updated the implementation guide

523
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,320
recently

524
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,440
and it also include micro tick so if you

525
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,000
have

526
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,320
uh if you want to look at it please go

527
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,039
um

528
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,280
onto the manage.org website and you can

529
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,559
get all the details

530
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,440
um here's the link for uh the

531
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,039
implementation guide just in case you

532
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,400
are interested

533
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,520
we also have a manners lab which

534
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,880
also include

535
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,440
microtech so you can test it if you

536
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,200
don't have a lab you can test it

537
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,960
on our lab and we can help you with that

538
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,600
as well so this is all i wanted to

539
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,320
discuss if you have any questions i'm

540
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,880
more than

541
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
happy to answer that

542
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,760
i have to have a great presentation

543
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,679
thanks for joining us for the

544
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,039
this qa and

545
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,760
this is a really good summary of all the

546
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,799
incidents

547
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,720
here in the last few years with route

548
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,120
advertisements and

549
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,600
some of those autonomous systems showing

550
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,440
up

551
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,080
the first question we have is um you at

552
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,960
the very end

553
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,320
you recommended uh references like

554
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
manners and best practices

555
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,799
um for a service provider what would be

556
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,240
the first step

557
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,520
uh towards uh helping with

558
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,600
this uh the cases you described here

559
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
what would be the first steps

560
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,640
a service an operator should take

561
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,360
yeah uh thank you for having me um the

562
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,640
most important thing for

563
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,200
any foreign service provider is just the

564
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,080
one term we

565
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,440
we learned um early in the year

566
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,559
starting as a network engineer was never

567
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,000
trust your customers

568
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,799
so treat your own network as your own

569
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,960
customer at times if it isn't segmented

570
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,679
in a way

571
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,000
so make sure that you filter out

572
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,080
anything which is not supposed to be on

573
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,400
the

574
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
internet which is not supposed to be on

575
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,840
the log table so first thing

576
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,880
just look up your own login table that

577
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
what are you announcing to the world

578
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,000
is it uh the right prefixes is it the

579
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,159
is it originating from the right as

580
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,960
number so just look it up and

581
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,640
make sure that you are not announcing

582
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,320
anything uh which

583
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,039
is not supposed to be and for that as i

584
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,480
mentioned on the uh

585
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,400
presentation that there we do have an

586
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,320
implementation guide on the website but

587
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,200
uh not just that um nl nog which is the

588
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,080
netherland

589
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,320
uh knob they do have a very nice bgp

590
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,919
filtering premiere on the website

591
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,640
you can have a look they have filters

592
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,080
available for all

593
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,120
major routing os's uh

594
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,799
in microtech included but

595
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,200
you you can test it with some of them um

596
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,919
and see

597
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,279
um what is the outcome of those filters

598
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,720
so uh most important thing i would say

599
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,039
is

600
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,559
just have a look at what you are

601
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,080
advertising first

602
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,279
um and then start going from there make

603
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,799
sure you have the filters in place

604
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,480
okay very good and i think you mentioned

605
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,919
earlier that uh

606
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,679
i think you make sure you have filters

607
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,120
for the as numbers

608
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
that you're learning that would be an

609
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,840
easy step

610
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,760
sorry i uh you dropped for a second

611
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,880
yes earlier you were

612
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,320
talking about filtering on as numbers um

613
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,840
that is uh definitely a a recommendation

614
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,080
at this point yes absolutely so what we

615
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,039
have seen um

616
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,600
uh quite regularly even those who are

617
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,919
very strict with the prefix filtering

618
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,240
uh they do not implement the as filter

619
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,720
and i would say it is important that it

620
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,000
this this

621
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,240
part is also important yes prefix

622
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,919
filtering is much more important of

623
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,480
course because

624
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,240
we have seen the route hijacks because

625
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,000
of that but as filtering

626
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,919
is also important so just make sure

627
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,360
whenever you are putting filters in

628
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:03,919
place

629
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,919
you do not omit the as filters

630
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,200
so that it is as important as the prefix

631
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,840
got it thank you another question is

632
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,200
what other methods

633
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,080
to replace bgps pet prepending for

634
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,919
inbound internet traffic

635
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,919
engineering are available i mean the one

636
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,320
people are using quite often is the

637
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,600
de-aggregation

638
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,679
i think we are at the stage where we do

639
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,760
not

640
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,840
discriminate the aggregation anymore we

641
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,200
i think we have stopped it

642
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,120
quite long ago so you may use that

643
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,559
if that can help what we have seen i

644
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,679
remember

645
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,559
doug midori did a research paper quite a

646
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,279
long time

647
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,360
not so long ago where he actually

648
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,640
measured the actual

649
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,720
part of the aspen that how many times

650
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,960
people are trying to prepend

651
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,159
and there are some astonishing numbers

652
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,000
uh huge uh i have no idea what

653
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,200
that yields um so uh of course whatever

654
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,559
they are trying to do is not it's not

655
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,559
helping them so that's why they

656
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,360
keep on adding uh prepend so if that's

657
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,799
not working for you

658
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,840
you can de-aggregate um uh it's i i

659
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,600
don't think so it's a phone upon

660
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,120
practice anymore okay were you

661
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,039
um another question were you able to uh

662
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,559
in your analysis were you able to

663
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,880
differentiate between

664
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,559
talking about the single digit as

665
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,720
numbers there are entities out there

666
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,080
that are

667
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,679
advertising those and they have the

668
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,919
right to do that we're able to separate

669
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:38,240
that

670
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,440
from the ones that were advertising them

671
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,080
um

672
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,679
and we're not they're not authorized to

673
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,440
do that we're able to

674
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,480
separate that data absolutely so um

675
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,520
in in the result i have

676
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,200
put up on the slides um i only used

677
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,760
i reference checked um anything which

678
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,799
they were

679
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,120

683
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,159
