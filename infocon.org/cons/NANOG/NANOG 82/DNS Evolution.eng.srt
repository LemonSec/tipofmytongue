00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,240
hello to everyone

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,040
um my name is jeff houston i'm the chief

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,880
scientist at ap nick and

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,360
once again it's it's it's a pleasure to

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,280
uh to speak with you in these covered

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,199
blighted times

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,840
however you know the end is in sight i

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,160
fervently hope i think as do we all

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,080
and uh very soon now we will be doing

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,840
this face to face

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,199
um over the last few years i have become

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,920
fascinated by the domain name system i

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,840
suppose i have to come to the conclusion

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,559
that

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,480
if there were two things that bound the

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,760
internet together as a single network

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,800
it was the addressing structure

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,399
and the name structure now unfortunately

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,640
we blew up the addressing structure

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,039
kaboom this whole v4

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
um exhaustion and the rise of gnats and

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,360
and i would actually say address

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,559
ambiguity

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,039
completely broke apart the thesis that

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,800
every single connected device had a

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,920
unique ipv4

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
ipv4 address and you know that was the

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,119
internet because

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,920
that's not true anymore just isn't and

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,720
so

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,600
the only thing that makes the internet

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,880
the internet

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
is actually a common name system and so

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,200
the dns is not only

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
a fascinating protocol and an amazing

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,759
ecosystem in its own right

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,439
it's the only thing keeping the internet

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,799
together so

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,080
some attention on this is probably very

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,640
very

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,840
well worth it and so today what i'd like

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,880
to do

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,520
is is not talk about the dns but talk

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,240
about

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
the pressures that are shaping its

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,280
evolution

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,520
and where it's likely to go and a word

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,560
of caution

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
this is not a happy talk okay there are

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,399
happy talks

52
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,960
there are really depressing talks i'm

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,799
leaning over into the really depressing

54
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,920
side so you know

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
don't say i didn't warn you

56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,439
it's true the dns is everything

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,479
everyone uses it for everything

58
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,560
every transaction on the internet starts

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,479
with a call on the dns

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
and if i could cozy up to you and there

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,720
are many ways of doing that

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,080
unfortunately

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
and see all your dns queries in real

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
time i know you

65
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,200
i know you really well i know what

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,879
you're doing i know what you're about to

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,160
do i know your interests i know

68
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,239
everything about you

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,000
and the applications and software you

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,879
run so the dns is extraordinarily

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,760
informative

72
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,800
but it's worse than that because it's

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
not just informative it's incredibly

74
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,239
chatty and

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,239
incredibly vulnerable the queries are

76
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,840
open and unencrypted

77
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,280
the payloads aren't secured the dns

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
you know stub resolver just believes the

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,480
first answer

80
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,519
whatever it might be tampering can't be

81
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,120
readily detected

82
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
and quite frankly false answers are

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,519
injected almost as an industry these

84
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,519
days all over the planet

85
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
lots of folk pick on the dns and

86
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
deliberately manipulate it

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,440
why because as a user you're a victim

88
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,800
where did that where did that answer

89
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
come from i don't know

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
i got one good but is it the right

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,200
answer

92
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
i don't know i'll just use it anyway and

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,760
see what happens users can't tell

94
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
that entire dns infrastructure is

95
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,000
completely opaque to the end user

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,280
so this is not good this is not good for

97
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,080
something that

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,519
we rely on on almost every single aspect

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,440
of our lives

100
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,720
but every single aspect of our

101
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,879
infrastructure these days

102
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,599
hacking destroys oil pipelines for a day

103
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,959
or two these days

104
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,720
hacking destroys a national health

105
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,400
system in ireland

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,519
this is important stuff and the name

107
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,599
infrastructure

108
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,640
seems to be close to a festering dungey

109
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,000
it's just ill-attended and we don't seem

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,599
to be doing much so let's look at what

111
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,200
we are trying to do

112
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,799
and see where this leads us so there are

113
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,640
three topics i'd like to talk about

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
authenticity the reliance we're placing

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,080
on the dns

116
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,920
and trying to plug some of those ghastly

117
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,519
information leaks

118
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,239
so how do you trust the answer you get

119
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,760
back from the dns

120
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,360
well the theory we've employed for the

121
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
last 30 years which you know

122
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,238
has never worked that well in any case

123
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:18,720
is just

124
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,320
if you send your question to the right

125
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
ip address you'll get the right answer

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
nonsense that's just no good

127
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,400
particularly with udp

128
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,120
anyone can fake any source address you

129
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,759
like

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,440
no matter where your query goes someone

131
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,360
can intercept it and answer as if they

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,479
were the real thing

133
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,759
so the first idea that 80 of the world's

134
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,360
users still rely on

135
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,840
is this naive idea that the internet's a

136
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,000
benign and wonderful place

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
we can all trust everyone to do the

138
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
right thing

139
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,759
nonsense the other way is to be

140
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,600
incredibly careful

141
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
and digitally sign everything and

142
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,440
validate

143
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,280
every answer you get and we call that

144
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,720
dns sec and

145
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,240
and so if you really want to trust the

146
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,320
dns you've got to sign

147
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,520
the dns entries and consumers have to

148
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,240
validate

149
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,960
so we should all be using it yes well

150
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,320
yes and no

151
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,600
because this is a map of

152
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,199
where users validate in the world

153
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,160
and where in north america now the good

154
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,680
news is it's not colored red

155
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
yay the bad news is

156
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
it's coloured orange where

157
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,639
is everyone using dns sect melanation

158
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,680
greenland's good

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,039
iceland is good uh mongolia is good and

160
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,680
saudi arabia just turned it on and the

161
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
scandi's

162
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
but everyone else not so what an odd map

163
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,479
and so let's look at this a little bit

164
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,080
further and look at the numbers

165
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,039
over a period of oh geez the last seven

166
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,080
years

167
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,720
um it's a slow burn approach it's a bit

168
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,440
like the

169
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,639
tortured long path of v6 adoption and

170
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,759
you know yay

171
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,639
uh v6 has overtaken us but you know dns

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,120
now around 22 percent of users

173
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,520
but that thing below 10 of users

174
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,080
go to a validating dns resolver and it

175
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,880
says

176
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,199
you're being fooled i'm going to give

177
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,720
you back serve fail

178
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,880
because this is going to be the wrong

179
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
answer if i gave it to you

180
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,560
and the the your user's resolver goes

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,919
for 10 of users wrong answer i'm going

182
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,840
to use someone who doesn't validate

183
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,800
because i prefer an answer good or bad

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,080
sorry

185
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,639
so you know a little over 35 percent of

186
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,759
users

187
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,240
perform validation but of those you know

188
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,479
10 percent of the world's users going up

189
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,360
don't believe it bad is bad it's not

190
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,639
really bad you just don't know what

191
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,960
you're talking about

192
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,039
so that's on the validation side who

193
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,240
signs dns sex

194
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,840
owns um who actually produces this well

195
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,720
public data on on dns six signing rates

196
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,800
is incredibly hard to come by

197
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,080
so various folk registries etc who

198
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,400
actually have this data know a little

199
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
bit about their corner of the dns

200
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,039
universe

201
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,960
but the larger picture of everybody and

202
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
everything out there in the dns

203
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,720
and there's no real data so the answer

204
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,479
is how many folks sign their dns

205
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,599
sign with dns some

206
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,400
and it's about as much as we know why is

207
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
it at everyone

208
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,680
well dnsec is a very mixed blessing

209
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,599
digital signatures are big and the

210
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,440
problem with the dns is it works best

211
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
when it's tiny

212
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,560
it's udp it likes to be below 512 octets

213
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,680
you can't really put meaningful

214
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
big signatures into udp in that size

215
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,360
you have to be extraordinarily clever

216
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,440
and use some of the latest uh encryption

217
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,160
algorithms

218
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
elliptical curve and try and compact

219
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
things down

220
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,759
as soon as you do anything else you're

221
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,000
fraught with the whole issue of dns and

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
large responses

223
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,599
and quite frankly everyone would prefer

224
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,960
to avoid that

225
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,199
the other thing is as a client

226
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,479
validating an answer

227
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,280
takes an eon or two you've got to back

228
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,080
trace and

229
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,720
question it's your parent it's parent

230
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,319
it's parent all the way back up to the

231
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,039
root

232
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,599
people don't live that long and so this

233
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,080
combination of transport uncertainty

234
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,759
and this incredible time lag on

235
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,840
validation has kind of the world has

236
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,319
said

237
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,800
yeah we'll let recursive resolvers

238
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,599
handle that

239
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,240
but in that all-important link from your

240
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
recursive resolver to you

241
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,799
you don't validate none of you do

242
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,760
and so if the recursive resolver lies

243
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,039
you're toast

244
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,000
and so dnsec is kind of mixed blessings

245
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,559
now

246
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,519
frustratingly we can do better we know

247
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,640
how to do better

248
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,160
there's a bunch of technologies here

249
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,320
which will really improve things

250
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,360
are we deploying them no no

251
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,640
you know we know what to do

252
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,160
but we don't know how you don't

253
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
understand how

254
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,399
we can all get there to do it so that

255
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,920
trade-off

256
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,279
people are just waiting i don't know

257
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,720
what they're waiting for but they're

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
just waiting

259
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
and so authenticity is a mixed blessing

260
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,920
the problem is

261
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,480
that we can't do this forever because we

262
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,880
are so reliant on the dns now

263
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,360
it used to be really really simple i

264
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,160
have a name

265
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,320
hi dns what's the ip address here's an

266
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
ip address

267
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,000
now your application goes that's a good

268
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,320
ip address i'm going to open a

269
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,760
tcp session on port 21.

270
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
yay let's negotiate a service and so in

271
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,760
some ways

272
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,440
all the services sitting in that name

273
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,120
share this common host ip address

274
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,399
fine for 1990

275
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,320
not fine for 2021. we want a whole lot

276
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,279
more

277
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,000
the service name and the platform that

278
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,440
hosts that service

279
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,320
are now very very different because of a

280
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
whole bunch of reasons

281
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,760
including the toxicity of the dns and

282
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,040
ddos attacks

283
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
if you've got a really important service

284
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,959
to broadcast on the internet you go and

285
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,320
find someone with a massive amount of

286
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,120
capacity

287
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,959
who does that for a living and they do a

288
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,240
damn fine job

289
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,320
but that means the service name and the

290
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
host name are now different

291
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
and somehow the dns needs to be able to

292
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
make that distinction

293
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
a collection of platforms are now used

294
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,839
to deliver one service name

295
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
one service many ip addresses we want to

296
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
outsource

297
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,079
electronic mail to one service we want

298
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,680
to outsource the web to another we want

299
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,720
to out here

300
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,640
different services want to be outsourced

301
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,920
in different ways

302
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,200
for the same service name so in other

303
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,120
words the generic dns service now

304
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,640
translates to many different

305
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,920
services and more to the port these days

306
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,600
with distributed content distribution

307
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,040
networks

308
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,640
if you're in mongolia and i'm not i'm

309
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,880
down in the snowy wintery depths of

310
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
australia

311
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,519
the best service delivery point is going

312
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,880
to be different

313
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
and so delivering the same answer to

314
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,000
both users

315
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,880
is kind of not doing anyone a favor you

316
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,240
want them to go to the right

317
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,279
service point but the issue is if i go

318
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,360
anywhere first and get redirected on the

319
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,320
second visit

320
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,839
i've wasted time and i'm really really

321
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,360
not that sure that i'm going to go to

322
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,040
the right point it's the second one that

323
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,720
counts that's not good enough

324
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
if you want it to be lightning fast you

325
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,880
have to go to the right service point

326
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,680
immediately there is no time and so the

327
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,640
redirection

328
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,720
to the right service point has to be in

329
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,079
the dns

330
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,760
and so we've tried all kinds of bells

331
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
and whistles in the dns it started with

332
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,440
this canonical name form

333
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,959
and then we decided that it wasn't just

334
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,560
the name it was the entire sub

335
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,360
sub tree dns name the d name and then we

336
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,760
found

337
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,000
you couldn't actually name the apex of a

338
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,800
zone

339
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,200
um and do that with a c name so some

340
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,720
folks who said

341
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
why not let's just do it anyway it kind

342
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,560
of works and others said no

343
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,880
no we need a new record a name which is

344
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,680
a true alias

345
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
none of them are very satisfactory the

346
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,200
problem is that as soon as you get any

347
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
technology that has you know

348
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,880
30 different solutions it really is a

349
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,000
clear signal you don't

350
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
know what you're doing cue v6 transition

351
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,480
strategies

352
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,079
30 different solutions we don't know

353
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
what we're doing put that aside and move

354
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,399
back to this sorry

355
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,320
so what did we try that we tried the srv

356
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
record and if you look at that srv

357
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,639
record

358
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,560
it's either a really useful swiss army

359
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,920
knife with all kinds of bells and

360
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,639
whistles

361
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,040
or it's kind of you know a step too far

362
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,639
and it's a chainsaw massacre

363
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,639
because what you actually do in the dns

364
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,000
query is add what you're going to do

365
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
you put on the query the port that

366
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,760
you're after the service name if you

367
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,240
will

368
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,480
and the protocol you're going to use and

369
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,760
ask the dns

370
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,839
with that additional information of the

371
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,279
service parameters

372
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
allowing the dns to then craft the right

373
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,399
answer

374
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,120
to oh it's the web oh it's tls oh i'm

375
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,360
going to give you this answer

376
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
and then of course there was the

377
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
incredible idea

378
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
that although the dns is largely

379
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,040
anonymous that once your query heads

380
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,639
into the image of the dns

381
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,839
your identity is not there anymore

382
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,760
which some folk regarded as a great

383
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
privacy protecting

384
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
feature and others regarded as

385
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,079
a problem that needed a solution and

386
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,920
we come up with the client subnet

387
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,279
extension where

388
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,120
across the query all the way through the

389
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,320
dns i add my subnet

390
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,880
well i hope it's my subnet and folks who

391
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,639
have looked at this from time to time

392
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,880
find an awful lot of ambiguity where

393
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,720
it's not just your subnet

394
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,040
it's your address that gets added and

395
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
it's kind of yeah great

396
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
needed that thank you so much now of

397
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
course we've gone into even more bells

398
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,079
and whistles because

399
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,079
you know once you start whistling you

400
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,360
just can't stop

401
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,040
and the latest incarnation is the svcb

402
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,240
and the https svc resource record that's

403
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,959
a mouthful

404
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,360
uh this is the kitchen sink mega

405
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,240
response

406
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,079
where if you ask a question with all of

407
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,360
these attributes about

408
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,199
where i want to go what protocol i want

409
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,040
to use what port etc

410
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,519
um the mega response gives you the

411
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,199
application level protocols available

412
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,120
the b4 and v6 addresses

413
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,639
i can even do encrypted service name

414
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,959
indicator the sni field and do encrypted

415
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,160
client hello there

416
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,360
i can get priorities on various answers

417
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,959
everything oh and by the way there's an

418
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,959
alias form as well so i can alias the

419
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,000
zone apex

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,880
so you know the latest bell and whistle

421
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,360
but

422
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,600
that's a problem and it's a problem we

423
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
need to be aware of

424
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,959
acutely because we're taking the dns

425
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,079
away from being a mapping alias

426
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,959
into being where am i about to go what

427
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,639
protocol am i about to use

428
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,600
what port am i going to use because now

429
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,399
we're optimizing rendezvous in the dns

430
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,519
which means if i could see your dns

431
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,959
answers

432
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,639
i know with almost absolute certainty

433
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,600
your next packet i know immediately what

434
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,920
you're going to do

435
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,360
not just where you've been what you've

436
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,040
done who you are etcetera

437
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,839
but what you're going to do which means

438
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,760
dns privacy issues become

439
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,199
super super critical now that brings us

440
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,720
to the third topic

441
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
what are we doing about that well one of

442
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,519
the first responses was

443
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,480
stop making the dns so damn chatty don't

444
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,800
tell everybody in the entire dns cloud

445
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
the full name you're going to go to

446
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,360
minimize the information link great move

447
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,880
tended to work well

448
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,040
why did it work well because oddly

449
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,360
enough recursive resolvers are easier to

450
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,320
change than

451
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
all those millions and millions and

452
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,480
millions of dns host libraries that are

453
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,199
out there

454
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,360
so query name minimization largely

455
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560
adopted

456
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
so now we're going okay let's look at

457
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,920
the edge let's look at that assets

458
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,759
network where people play

459
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,120
and play so badly right um let's add

460
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,920
tls same as the web let's actually put

461
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
transport level security

462
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
in that all important you know

463
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,360
connection between the end user and

464
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,040
their recursive resolver

465
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,639
channel protection remote end

466
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,160
authentication i know whom i'm talking

467
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,880
to now

468
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,440
transport robustness great udp

469
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,120
difficult so great advantages

470
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,920
some disadvantages but let's go further

471
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,040
let's do all of that

472
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,720
and add http object semantics with dns

473
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,000
over https

474
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
and let's go even further because you

475
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,759
know we can let's use https 3

476
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
and let's use quick so now i've not only

477
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
got channel protection in the payload

478
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,480
i've got channel protection of that

479
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,240
transport protocol

480
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,880
now you know this is good but we can do

481
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,839
better

482
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,519
because now we can do oblivious dns over

483
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,839
https

484
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,600
oblivious doe and now we're separating

485
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,399
who i am

486
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,720
from what i'm asking through a technique

487
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,880
of if you will double wrapping which was

488
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,720
as far as i can see borrowed a little

489
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,079
bit from tor

490
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,959
where you basically encode what you're

491
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,199
asking in one level of encryption

492
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,280
and encode who you're asking it from in

493
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,240
the first stop

494
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,359
in a second level no one knows

495
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,000
both things at once as long as people

496
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,679
don't collude of course

497
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,720
yeah okay so we have answers and coming

498
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,199
soon

499
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,480
we're even going to go further we're

500
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,559
going to put the dns between the

501
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,039
recursive and the authoritative

502
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,000
and it's kind of are we well we've done

503
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
it for stud to recursive this must be

504
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,400
easy

505
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,480
well no it's not it's not because

506
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,039
we are in love with the dns that no one

507
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,000
pays for

508
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,039
a dns that's free and once you start

509
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,000
adding this incredible overhead it

510
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,120
actually costs

511
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,400
in terms of load on services load on

512
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,200
protocol

513
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,840
load on clients and at some point what

514
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,919
was affordable becomes

515
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,039
expensive and to some extent it's not

516
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,000
easy to understand if we can do

517
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
efficient

518
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
cost-effective solutions in this space

519
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,520
we can do it

520
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,160
we'll folk pay tough call

521
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
and so this is part of this issue of

522
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,679
scaling up because

523
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,960
this tcp overhead and even the quick

524
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,160
overhead

525
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,480
you can amortize through session reuse i

526
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,080
established a session i asked lots of

527
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,880
queries

528
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,039
all of a sudden inside that channel it

529
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,720
looks a lot like udp

530
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,200
session reuse is great the problem is

531
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
that when you get from recursives to

532
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,919
authoritatives

533
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,000
there's not as much of that session

534
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,120
reuse

535
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,840
so scaling that infrastructure is tough

536
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,320
the economics of the dns go can't go

537
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,960
there

538
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,799
and somehow you either got to pay for

539
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,480
your dns queries that's going to go down

540
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
like a lead balloon

541
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,840
or we're going to have to be a little

542
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,679
bit more more cunning

543
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,000
and unfortunately as folk have tried and

544
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,200
failed

545
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
you can't use advertising revenue in the

546
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,080
dns you can't play with the answers

547
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,799
you can't change nx domain into use my

548
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,320
favorite search engine

549
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
that's not part of the game and when you

550
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,840
try that

551
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,880
and we have people not only frown at you

552
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
they start to shout at you and say

553
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,000
naughty words

554
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,840
so the question is of course now that

555
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
we're touching on the economics of

556
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,400
deployment

557
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,840
the real question is will all these

558
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,000
near-term changes get deployed and the

559
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,880
answer is well we we know what to do

560
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
and if money was no object we can do

561
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,559
that

562
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,679
we can certainly deploy tls https

563
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,360
we can use dns https svc records

564
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,600
we can push d and sec everywhere and

565
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,280
with tls

566
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,000
using a tcp like transport we can push

567
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,240
big answers around without the overhead

568
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,640
we can use dns chain extensions to make

569
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,679
the whole thing

570
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,320
really fast so we can

571
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,120
will we do it oh dear

572
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,440
oh dear we point to https and we go well

573
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,600
if the browsers can force the entire web

574
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,880
ecosystem to use

575
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,240
https what's your problem jeff

576
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
why why won't the dns just do this

577
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,919
and the answer really is when you're

578
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,039
trying to move

579
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,559
a large amount of infrastructure

580
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,280
it's incredibly challenging i don't

581
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,880
think we really recognized

582
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,400
the true extent of that v4 b6 transition

583
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,200
as a scaling problem it might have

584
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,039
started as a small internet you know in

585
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,559
the late 90s when we thought this was a

586
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,799
really good idea but this is a gigantic

587
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,520
internet

588
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,159
with many many points of investment with

589
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,760
equipment that has

590
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,559
5 10 depressingly 20 years

591
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,600
of service lifetime out there

592
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
making a change when you're talking

593
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,200
about things like cpe

594
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,760
equipment is not oh yeah we can do this

595
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,440
next week we can roll out some firmware

596
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,919
changes

597
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,760
it'll be easy it isn't and it won't

598
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,080
now people will change things if there's

599
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,360
money in it

600
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,120
people will change things when they can

601
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,559
see their competitors

602
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,799
if you will tapping a market either

603
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,799
making more money or producing a cheaper

604
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,919
service

605
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,760
but the dns isn't that kind of economy

606
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,679
there's no untapped financial return in

607
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,440
dns resolution

608
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,600
for everyone your dns resolver is a cost

609
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,679
not revenue and so where's the

610
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,360
commercial impetus to change all the

611
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,400
cpes

612
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,720
to roll out this extraordinary amount of

613
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,799
change to all move to tls

614
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,880
and doe well the answer is none

615
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
and more to the point too there's an

616
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,480
entire industry

617
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,600
used by governments and many many others

618
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,120
in taking advantage of the openness of

619
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,000
the dns

620
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,880
and using that oversight and alteration

621
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
as a means of content moderation

622
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,679
the great firewall of china is to a very

623
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,799
large extent

624
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,679
dns based and there's little appetite

625
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,360
from all of these players

626
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,000
to make that role harder to perform and

627
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,559
so not only is it difficult to do

628
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,000
but there are folk trying to stop you

629
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,720
doing it now

630
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,440
if the browsers can push https why don't

631
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,520
the browsers just push this

632
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,640
well so far browser vendors have had a

633
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
much more limited round leverage in the

634
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,360
dns

635
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,120
they don't run the cpe they don't run

636
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,799
the infrastructure they don't run any of

637
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,919
this stuff

638
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,000
so how can they influence everyone else

639
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,159
the answer is well

640
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,440
not looking good because like i said

641
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,600
you don't pay and if you don't pay it's

642
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
a cost not revenue

643
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,600
and all those efforts to monetize the

644
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,960
dns

645
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,840
to change the answer because you pay me

646
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,159
to change your next domain because i can

647
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,840
basically say that's not the name you're

648
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,000
looking for try jeff's whizzo search

649
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,120
service instead

650
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,600
instead of giving you back nx domain

651
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,679
this is generally regarded as

652
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,400
a bad thing and when i say extreme

653
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
disfavor

654
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,440
we tend to get into acts of well have we

655
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,000
just done wire fraud by changing the dns

656
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,640
you know you can't do that in the dns

657
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,159
and get away with it

658
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,679
and and so open resolver efforts are by

659
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,159
and large with a couple of exceptions

660
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,760
success disasters

661
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,240
the more they're used the more it costs

662
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,760
the person running it

663
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,720
and so the more it costs greater the

664
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
funding problem

665
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
and so aggressively marketing and open

666
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,919
dns resolver says

667
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,080
wow i really like burning money up in my

668
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,679
front yard don't i

669
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,600
unless there's another business reason

670
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,520
of cross-subsidization or some other

671
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,480
form

672
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,000
and certainly with some of the open

673
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,840
resolvers you can see that that that

674
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,200
particular motivation

675
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,760
for everyone else it's just not there so

676
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,200
the dns economy

677
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,240
resists change so it's a little wonder

678
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,600
that no one changes the default your isp

679
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,200
does it for you as part of the access

680
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,080
service

681
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,120
you use it seventy percent

682
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,520
of all end clients as when we measure it

683
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
use the same network result you know the

684
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,159
same

685
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,279
network resolve as supplied by the isp

686
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,840
only thirty percent go elsewhere but the

687
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,919
issue is even those thirty percent

688
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,640
actually are directed to other places by

689
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
their isp

690
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,200
very few flow folk actually pay with the

691
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,039
buttons on their devices

692
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,520
very very few and if you're sitting

693
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,279
there and now not going but i do what's

694
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,120
the problem the answer is

695
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,840
you're special you really are very very

696
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,480
special

697
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,039
the rest of us don't do that and so for

698
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,799
that reason the dns doesn't like

699
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:39,919
changing

700
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,200
and so we look at all these great

701
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
changes to improve the dns to make it

702
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,120
more resilient to make it more robust

703
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,799
to make it harder to tap and change you

704
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,640
kind of go well is that going to become

705
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,400
mainstream

706
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,640
nah cns is going to stay in the

707
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,200
in udp it's going to stay the clunky

708
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,720
system that it is

709
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,960
because no one's going to change their

710
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
settings to something better

711
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,000
and what we have now is affordable and

712
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,080
kind of that's where we're stuck the

713
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,240
department of good ideas just can't sell

714
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
this into existing infrastructure

715
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
because it's going to cost and no one's

716
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,559
going to pay and so in some ways

717
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,360
we're kind of stuck here or not

718
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,840
because emerging from all of this is

719
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,320
actually a different story

720
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,159
and the issue is that there are various

721
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,159
applications and don't forget the money

722
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,919
is in content it's not in carriage

723
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:32,799
anymore

724
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,520
and the folk who have money in content

725
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,600
are sick and tired of a dns that doesn't

726
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,640
work well

727
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,200
a sick and tired of a dns that's slow a

728
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,720
sick and tired of a dns where you have

729
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,200
to compromise authenticity and security

730
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,960
because the rest of the dns world isn't

731
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,200
moving at their speed

732
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,159
and i said they have all the money and

733
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:52,640
doe

734
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,600
is almost a unique opportunity to go

735
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,559
elsewhere

736
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,840
to lift yourself out of the network and

737
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,520
out of the platform

738
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,600
and don't rely on the user you're the

739
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,640
app

740
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,000
for the app to drive its queries about

741
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,279
name resolution into its own

742
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,880
infrastructure an application selected

743
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,279
name resolution service i call it dns

744
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,720
but i'm not sure if it will be in the

745
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,840
long run

746
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,720
that basically bypasses all of those dns

747
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,880
over udp libraries in the platform

748
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,960
and bypasses all the config settings

749
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,559
coming in from your isp

750
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,360
the application system ecosystem is

751
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,840
going to move at a different pace

752
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,400
they are the point making the demands

753
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,919
and in some ways if they can't force

754
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,360
everyone else to invest in the

755
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,039
infrastructure they need

756
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,000
if they really want it they'll build it

757
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,520
themselves

758
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,279
and they will make their own

759
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,360
infrastructure and simply avoid waiting

760
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,440
sucks to be you but i've solved my

761
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,480
problem

762
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,400
and we're seeing that attitude again and

763
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,320
again in this application space

764
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,520
if i can't shift that gigantic

765
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,640
anchor of deployed infrastructure and

766
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,240
get them to spend money to make it

767
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,200
better

768
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,279
i'm going to bypass it i'm going to

769
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,640
bypass not just

770
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,799
that resolution infrastructure i'm going

771
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,000
to bypass that

772
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,880
name infrastructure and so the prospect

773
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,640
of these application specific naming

774
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,760
services

775
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,840
it is not just an abstract thing or

776
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,520
might happen it might not

777
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,480
uh it's happening it's part of now where

778
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,000
these folk need to go

779
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
in order to make their applications

780
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
solid

781
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,159
and so what we're seeing is actually an

782
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,399
age-old kind of answer

783
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,880
that folks who have the motivation and

784
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,200
the money

785
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,279
will stop waiting for everyone else to

786
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,640
get the picture

787
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,960
at some point they're just going to move

788
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,880
and take their part of the game with

789
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,600
them

790
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,840
and do what they feel they need to do

791
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,799
and so the evolution of the dns

792
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
is actually in some ways it's imminent

793
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,919
destruction

794
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,640
as a single cohesive name structure

795
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
we're ripping it apart

796
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,399
because we simply can't move it all

797
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,559
together along the same wave front

798
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,200
and the folk with the urgent needs and

799
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,399
money

800
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,799
go and create their own solution so you

801
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,320
know with apologies to the trekkies out

802
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,960
there you know

803
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
it's life jim but not as we know it

804
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,440
because this evolution from

805
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,640
network carriage to platform

806
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,480
it was used to be windows didn't it to

807
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,000
application-centric worlds

808
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,679
is actually happening across the entire

809
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,360
internet and the dns

810
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
is being swept up in this shift you know

811
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,520
the dns is changing in every single

812
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,559
respect

813
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,440
and the result is if it's the name space

814
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,919
that's keeping the internet together

815
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,440
i have some pretty bad news for you

816
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,360
i told you it was a depressing talk

817
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,720
thank you very much

818
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,559
um i'll come back online at this point

819
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,919
and we'll be happy to answer any

820
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,279
questions you might have

821
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,480
thanks indeed

822
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,720
hi hello uh thank you jeff for your

823
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,760
presentation

824
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,440
and as expected we have a pretty deep

825
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,120
queue of questions so let's see what we

826
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,399
can get through here

827
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,640
um look what you look look what you've

828
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,760
done

829
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,039
sorry all right okay

830
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,480
so started okay um patrick i see

831
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,919
two dns providers in quotes the huge

832
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:24,480
ones

833
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,360
google akamai opengns amazon microsoft

834
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,240
etc

835
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,320
and the little ones will the additional

836
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,120
cost of tls on the big ones be offset by

837
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,720
not having to deal with the constant

838
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
reflection and other attacks

839
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,000
and i think the little ones do not care

840
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,080
um patrick's talking about a slightly

841
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,360
different area than i was

842
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,120
i was actually referring to i was

843
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,480
referring to resolving

844
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,559
patrick's talking about publishing and

845
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,919
there's no doubt too that

846
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,720
centralization in the dns you know who

847
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,799
actually is your authoritative server

848
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,799
is now a highly concentrated market in

849
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,159
the nov itself

850
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,120
um their interests actually have a

851
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,080
commercial

852
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,919
aspect because you pay to have your name

853
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,200
hosted so

854
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,880
yeah they're going to do dough and

855
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,559
everything else under the sun

856
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,640
because if amazon does it akamai has to

857
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
do it etc etc

858
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,760
resolution however is a toxic

859
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,320
economic wasteland as well as a toxic

860
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,679
ddos wasteland

861
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,760
and so we're seeing the sort of splits

862
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
in the dns where some parts actually

863
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,640
have money

864
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,960
but the bits that matter to you and i

865
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,440
was resolution

866
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,679
no nothing's changing no one's paying

867
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,120
and that's the bit that actually

868
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,080
is the bit that gets stuck everywhere so

869
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,799
yes

870
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,640
the servers will change the clients

871
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,360
won't oops

872
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,320
okay next question from mattpack

873
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,880
why not do it like ipv6 simply have

874
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,640
governance mandate a change over to more

875
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
secure dns communication

876
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,080
and i have you laughing harmony

877
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,320
great question do i need to save more

878
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,720
aren't we in year 20 of this this

879
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,760
transition

880
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,240
we lived through exhaustion we lived

881
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,440
through something that was never meant

882
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,559
to happen

883
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,600
and you know it's still not here uh no

884
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,120
sorry no no next question

885
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,720
okay um this is from ryan holloway

886
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,200
has anyone ever done an actual study on

887
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,519
how much the migration of dns to

888
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,960
tcp https tls quit etc

889
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,840
affects the bottom line of an eyeball

890
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,240
network

891
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,960
well you know the problem is in so many

892
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,360
ways that we put out cpe

893
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,679
that has little bits of stub shocking

894
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,960
dns dns mask is you know primitive stuff

895
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,360
and so the real cost isn't in changing

896
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,519
my recursive resolver that i have have

897
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,000
deep in my infrastructure it's changing

898
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
the stuff deployed out there

899
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,279
and anyone in the isp business you know

900
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,640
size and weeps and moans over cpe

901
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,320
a huge amount of capital is out there

902
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,600
whether the customer bought it or

903
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,279
whether i bought it

904
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,039
running that maintaining it is a

905
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,039
headache and that's the bit that's so

906
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,559
difficult to change

907
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,080
and you know v6 was basically sacrificed

908
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,679
to the gods of cpe

909
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,360
it was just so difficult to get them to

910
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,679
go dual stack and it took forever

911
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,279
to try and change the dns in that cpe

912
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,360
um we're not going to live long enough

913
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,200
and it's sort of there's no money out

914
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,080
there

915
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,559
no one pays 100 bucks a month to rent a

916
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,760
cpe

917
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
no one even pays one dollar a month you

918
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,679
know nobody pays

919
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,360
and that's the problem here that the big

920
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,919
bit that gets difficult to change

921
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,399
is the most numerous part of this all

922
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,480
those tiny recursive resolvers out there

923
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,600
in newsland

924
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,840
and so that's the problem that's the bit

925
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,679
that actually is making everyone else go

926
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,240
near not a problem i'm willing to solve

927
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,880
udp

928
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,720
is fine i don't have a problem

929
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,279
okay uh one last question looks like

930
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,080
uh from michael doherty doh is a great

931
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,559
thing

932
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,320
but what about our secure environments

933
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,159
that need insight into what is being

934
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:06,960
sent

935
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,799
evil bob has been sending dns to a

936
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,000
botnet and other not

937
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,519
niceness for a long time using

938
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,519
encryption

939
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,880
um there's a whole industry that relies

940
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,200
on

941
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,240
open text dns queries over udp

942
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,320
and whether it's clean feed in some

943
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,600
countries or

944
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,919
dns block lists in my country and a

945
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,039
whole bunch of others

946
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,000
enterprise vpns and so on and so forth

947
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,880
yes

948
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,279
we have grown used to business models

949
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,519
that rely on this visibility

950
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,120
and yes doe and indeed a whole lot of

951
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,279
actions around this area of increasing

952
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,679
the armor plating in the dns go directly

953
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:44,799
against that

954
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,440
and this is pitting applications against

955
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,200
infrastructure

956
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,399
now infrastructure would normally win

957
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,720
because that's where the money is oops

958
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,480
there's no money left

959
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,039
the money is up in content the money is

960
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,480
up in applications

961
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,399
that money is talking and what that

962
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,000
money is effectively saying

963
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,360
is i'm going to make queries that

964
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,320
protect the use of this application and

965
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
and that's the bit that the enterprise

966
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,520
folk have now got to

967
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
grapple with and there are no easy

968
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,639
solutions out there

969
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,760
there really aren't um this fracturing

970
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,000
and

971
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,960
tension is going to resolve itself in

972
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,040
splitting up the name space

973
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,399
and you know the real thing you've got

974
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,599
to worry about is not whether

975
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,359
enterprises survive this or not i think

976
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,520
that's irrelevant in some ways sorry

977
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,839
the the real thing is actually wondering

978
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,399
once we break apart the namespace

979
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,719
and the name that you try and resolve

980
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,879
goes somewhere else to the same name

981
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,639
that i'm trying to resolve

982
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,760
you know what's the internet

983
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,239
what have we got left there's no uniform

984
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,000
address space and if there's no uniform

985
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,839
namespace it's kind of

986
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,520
wow oops i guess we broke it

987
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,599
so yeah these are deep questions and i

988
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,440
wish i had really good answers but

989
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,599
you know these just are really really

990
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,800
deep questions

991
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,720
and what we're doing to ourselves by

992
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,000
empowering

993
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,720
that sort of area where applications are

994
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,240
now asserting

995
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,480
themselves in a way that's independent

996
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,000
of the platform independent of the

997
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,040
the comms infrastructure independently

998
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,640
is actually creating a system that's

999
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,720
very very heavily fragmenting

1000
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
so you know yeah that's the internet

1001
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,040
great

1002
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,520
i think that is our last question as we

1003
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,960
are on time unfortunately

1004
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,200
um but chat windows should be open for a

1005
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,800
little while longer if uh

1006
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,320
if you want to engage there um so before

1007
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,520
we close the day well

1008
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,079
first off thank you again for your time

1009
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,599
presentation jeff

1010
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,040
thank you always a pleasure to have you

1011
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
here at nadog and

1012
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,280
hopefully we will have you in person

1013
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,079
[Music]

1014
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,079
soon
