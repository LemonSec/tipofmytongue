uh screen there there are many reasons

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,920
why these local nogs exist

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,400
if you ever thought of starting a nog

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,320
this presentation aims to encourage you

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,880
to pursue forming that local nog

46
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,040
reasons benefits to your local community

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,320
and help you with that process

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,280
all right let's get started we'll begin

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,079
with

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,040
the reasons to start a nog as well as

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,240
the flip side why

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,479
not to start a nog we'll define a nog

53
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,520
go through who should start a knock then

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,119
i'll hand it over back to tom

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,399
who will talk about how he started china

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,640
he'll give you pointers on where to

57
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,920
start

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,040
build local community tips on how to

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,080
hold that first

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,120
community meeting and then uh followed

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
up by different growing

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,239
phases of knobs and finally the

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,840
nog blueprint so if

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,560
i were if we were in person i'd ask

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
raise of hands or

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,319
again put it in that chat how many of

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:36,879
you

68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,480
is this your first time attending nanak

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,080
how about first time to any nog

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,599
this is about the first time or

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,879
think about the first time you

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,959
participated in an event like this in

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,000
person

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
what were your reasons was it purely to

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,440
learn from each other

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
was it to watch a speaker present on

77
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
best practices

78
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,840
lessons learned or perhaps a new

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,159
technology or upcoming trend

80
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,879
or were you invited to give a talk share

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,599
something that

82
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,959
you have some expertise in was it to

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,480
interact with other like-minded people

84
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
in the networking industry

85
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,680
maybe look for a job looking for a

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,879
mentor

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,800
maybe to collaborate on a project or an

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
idea

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
informally learning real world

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,519
unfiltered experiences from others

91
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,599
if you think back though to that first

92
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,760
time were you excited

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
maybe traveling to that conference

94
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,120
excited to meet lots of new people new

95
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
faces

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,519
or while being excited did you have a

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,879
slight feeling of

98
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,400
intimidation some angst may be mixed in

99
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,239
you had to get on a plane to travel to

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,599
the conference

101
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,000
tired by the time you got there lots of

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,720
people

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,519
new faces maybe didn't really know

104
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,840
anyone there

105
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
what's great about local nogs are that

106
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,000
you can define your own community

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,159
i'll be referencing it as local nogs

108
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,760
since there's a lot to be said about

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,439
geography or locality as we saw earlier

110
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,439
there are a few nogs based upon large

111
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,200
metro cities

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,760
but that doesn't mean you can't start a

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,320
nog

114
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,358
based upon i'll call it a specialty

115
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,960
or vertical such as cdns

116
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,560
cloud maybe utilities oil and gas

117
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
gaming enterprise you can start a nog

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,720
based upon

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,479
any shared commonality going back to

120
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,120
that first

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,680
nog experience and i can only speak for

122
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
myself but i fell into that ladder

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,639
excited with some intimidation mixed in

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,520
that is why local vlogs make sense

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,160
usually

126
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,280
they are smaller in size more intimate

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,320
and there is a bit more focus either by

128
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
the vertical or just by the nature of

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,600
the location

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,759
and you'll see what i mean about this in

131
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,199
a bit

132
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,520
being geographically closer also means

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,440
probably not getting on a plane

134
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
maybe a short drive to attend the local

135
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,560
nog it's much easier for us to connect

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,000
when we are geographically closer

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,759
one thing we've talked about at nano

138
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,800
is the nnp next networking professional

139
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,759
but look back when you first started

140
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,400
maybe

141
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,639
you're just starting out now put

142
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,320
yourself into that junior engineer's

143
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,360
shoes

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,240
or perhaps someone who's not a network

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,039
engineer

146
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,520
and just has interest or is interested

147
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
in becoming

148
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,000
that nnp again think of why

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,039
you wanted to attend a nog then think of

150
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,240
when you had to ask

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
whomever's approval to attend the event

152
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,919
what questions were asked what were your

153
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,600
justifications

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
well how much is it where is it at

155
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,639
how much is the airfare hotel rental car

156
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,560
how long will you be out of the office

157
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,240
the whole week

158
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,680
these were some of the barriers that i

159
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,240
know i and others had to overcome

160
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,120
but not everyone got approval how about

161
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,400
if the narrative changed and your

162
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
responses were the following

163
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
oh i'll be gone just one day or just the

164
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,080
afternoon

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,960
and it's just a short drive would asking

166
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,919
getting approval

167
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,960
be much easier then being local helps

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
remove travel as barriers to attend and

169
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,199
opens the doors for many others to join

170
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,440
that community

171
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,479
while you may not be an nnp maybe

172
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,880
mid-career are looking to change fields

173
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,680
whatever stage you are in knox are a

174
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
great way to find a mentor

175
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,440
or be a mentor grow and collaborate

176
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,240
also while this may not be the case a

177
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
hundred percent of the time

178
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,639
but being local and having a more

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,759
intimate group

180
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,560
makes it much easier to talk to everyone

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,599
attending

182
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,360
while also being able to introduce

183
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,639
oneself and not

184
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,599
feel like a total outsider how many

185
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,360
times have you attended a conference and

186
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,199
you finally saw someone but

187
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,280
only on the last day wishing more time

188
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
to connect

189
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,039
how about when individuals are meeting

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,479
the first time

191
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,599
and introducing your themselves what's

192
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,560
uh a common question it's where are you

193
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,599
from

194
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,000
and and why is that it's because as

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,720
humans

196
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
we want connections we ask this so that

197
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,720
we can make

198
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
personal connection oh i've been there

199
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,560
it's a great city beautiful during the

200
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,440
summer

201
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,720
or that's one place i'd like to visit

202
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,599
when you narrow down the geography this

203
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,599
probability or commonality

204
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,960
goes up the conversation then turns to

205
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,520
oh there's a great restaurant at the

206
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,800
corner of x and y

207
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
have you been there maybe we should go

208
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
grab brunch or something

209
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,520
this is that sense of local community

210
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,800
and

211
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
geography isn't the only reason but

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
usually a strong one to create a nag

213
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,599
around

214
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,639
one of the main reasons for a nog

215
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,520
is to build the people-to-people social

216
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
network

217
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,840
the face-to-face network look someone in

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,879
the eye

219
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,360
and have a conversation network and

220
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
locality

221
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,520
does help in that regard

222
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,400
one of the positive side effects given

223
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
kovid and the events of the past

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,280
year nanog and others shifted events to

225
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
be virtual

226
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,839
we've seen that this opened the door to

227
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,839
a wider range of attendees that wasn't

228
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,679
possible before

229
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,360
these attendees always wanted to attend

230
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,279
nano but couldn't

231
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,279
just due to travel and budget

232
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,279
constraints

233
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,080
now that that's a great thing but i

234
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,480
think

235
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
one thing that all these virtual

236
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,560
conferences have in common

237
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
and i've heard this from several

238
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,200
attendees at various conferences

239
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,320
is they want that in-person feeling

240
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,959
and really nothing at the moment beats

241
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,440
being

242
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,040
live and in person face to face

243
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,920
so we've gone through just a few reasons

244
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,160
of

245
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,959
why to start a dog but let's take a

246
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,160
moment on reasons

247
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,480
not to start a nog monetary

248
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
if you look at successful nogs they are

249
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,160
non-profit

250
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
if your goal is to make money by holding

251
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,360
dog events

252
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,160
just just don't you're doing it for the

253
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,040
wrong reasons

254
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,360
and not in the spirit of helping others

255
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,680
forming a community

256
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,720
promoting or marketing content were hit

257
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
all day long with marketing

258
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
unsolicited calls if i wanted to attend

259
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,600
another marketing pitch

260
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
i'll just go ask my vendor to give it to

261
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,240
me we want to listen to technical

262
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,279
content

263
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,760
we want to hear unfiltered experiences

264
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,120
from attendees

265
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
the good bad and ugly people will see

266
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
that you're trying to gain something

267
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,000
versus building something now a

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,120
short story here it was nanog77 i just

269
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,000
happened to sit

270
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,640
next to a first-time attendee i believe

271
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,399
it was during the opening session

272
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,279
i had asked uh i see this is your first

273
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,720
time attending nanog

274
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
and i had introduced myself and at the

275
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,160
time i was the vice chair of the program

276
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,120
committee

277
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
i went on to ask uh you work for a large

278
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,839
oil field services company

279
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,640
uh that's not the typical uh company we

280
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,959
see in attendance here at nano

281
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
can i ask what interested you and what

282
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,959
brings you to nanag

283
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,360
and i'm paraphrasing this but the answer

284
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,079
was

285
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,160
short and sweet i'm looking for a

286
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,320
non-vendor-specific

287
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,279
technical conference where i can learn

288
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,880
from the presenters

289
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,279
about technology and talk with other

290
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,200
network engineers that have real world

291
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
experiences

292
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
without all the marketing or being

293
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,640
one-sided

294
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,399
nano is the closest i found to that

295
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,399
we've gone through the reasons why and

296
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,160
why not to start a nog

297
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,200
well we've never really defined it

298
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,839
when tom and i were putting this

299
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,040
presentation together

300
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,200
we never intended to put a definition

301
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
slide in

302
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,720
this was actually a last minute edition

303
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,959
but when you compare this definition

304
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,920
coming from wikipedia uh to the why

305
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,959
start a nog

306
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,760
we on through earlier you'll see much of

307
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,839
the same core tenants and principles

308
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,959
highlighted country based

309
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,440
or regional mutual interest

310
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,680
networking profession and others

311
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
those whose jobs are network engineers

312
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,519
and i wouldn't restrict it to

313
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
not only those in the research and

314
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,040
technical communities

315
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
think about those that are just looking

316
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,480
to get into the field

317
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,200
the next networking professional

318
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,760
basically

319
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,680
anyone who has an interest in networking

320
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,040
and related technologies

321
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,839
update each other on their work share

322
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,600
news and updates

323
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,720
exchange best practices

324
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,680
discuss new technologies or protocols

325
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,320
teach and learn from others

326
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,839
network with other members of the

327
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
community

328
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
and discuss current network and internet

329
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,480
related issues and challenges

330
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,000
so we spoke of the why and what

331
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,120
now it's who should start a knock if

332
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
we were all in person i would say look

333
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,959
to your left

334
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,920
then look to the right then get out your

335
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,399
phone

336
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,639
take a selfie because everyone here

337
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,600
should be looking

338
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
to themselves first looking into the

339
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,440
mirror to start

340
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,480
or at least participate contribute to a

341
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,000
local nog

342
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,560
you are all here part of the nano

343
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,760
community

344
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,839
but think about your local community

345
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,360
again let's start with

346
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,639
geographic locality region as we talked

347
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,760
about

348
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,720
is probably the easiest to begin with

349
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,839
but we also said

350
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,800
a nod could be any commonality maybe a

351
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,680
vertical

352
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,040
service provider enterprise gaming

353
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,480
finance utilities oil and gas

354
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,040
cdn these are just a few there's plenty

355
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,639
more out there

356
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,240
each one of these communities has a

357
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,160
specific requirement

358
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,120
specific issues and challenges that are

359
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,360
unique to their own vertical

360
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,920
enterprises deal with campus access

361
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,120
connecting campuses

362
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,000
wi-fi mobility and over the past year

363
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
dealing with work from home

364
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
gaming what what comes to mind low

365
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,560
latency scaling on demand

366
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,199
finance and high frequency trading

367
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,000
that's another low latency requirement

368
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,399
cdns quickest path to data reducing

369
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,440
redundant traffic

370
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,360
again scaling on demand oil and gas

371
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
energy industrial requirements

372
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,959
just to name a few and let's not forget

373
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,079
security

374
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,800
covers or encompasses crosses all these

375
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,639
verticals

376
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,079
so while there are some unique

377
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,000
challenges within each vertical

378
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,320
uh if we were to build a venn diagram of

379
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,360
sorts

380
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,800
you'd see that there would be a good

381
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
overlap common problems that span

382
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,240
all it would be a good idea to

383
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,680
get diversity within a nog

384
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,320
so that others can see how they have

385
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,839
solved the same problem

386
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,160
why they took the path they did and get

387
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
a different viewpoint

388
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,199
avoid group mind thinking we've seen it

389
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,720
with spine and leaf in the data center

390
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,800
migrating to evp and vxlan into the

391
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,320
campus as well into

392
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
distributed router models another

393
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,880
reason to start with local nogs

394
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,639
uh take for example an nyc

395
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,000
shy la i mean these are financial hubs

396
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,800
right

397
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,639
but if you look at these locations

398
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,880
they're also big enterprises

399
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
then server service providers ixps

400
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,519
due to connection requirements usually

401
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,680
you'll also find cloud companies and

402
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,000
cdns in these colos

403
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,560
i take those cities for example but that

404
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,519
model where

405
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,120
there's the intermixing of various

406
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,720
networks together

407
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,680
is basically ubiquitous at this point

408
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,720
right and if it's not

409
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,480
it's going to be but i digress back to

410
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,360
the topic

411
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,199
who should start a nog if you were to

412
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,040
search for a local nog on the internet

413
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
or a nog specific to a vertical

414
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,800
and can't find one then you should

415
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,560
consider starting one

416
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,959
again our goal is to help enable you to

417
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,240
start a nog

418
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,240
i encourage you to think about it and if

419
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,360
worst case

420
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,040
particip participate in your local nog

421
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
i'm going to turn it now over to my good

422
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,800
friend tom where he'll talk about

423
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,000
how he started and grew shynok thank you

424
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,639
vince

425
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,720
next we'd like to talk about a use case

426
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
of chicago network operators group

427
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,399
and share with your experiences it was

428
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,800
started over nine years ago in 2013.

429
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,279
now who started it back then it was

430
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,360
brian mcgann jason craft and me

431
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,399
that started how did the idea come about

432
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,399
um basically we met at brian's one of

433
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,000
brian's classes he was teaching

434
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,600
and realized um we have a nice local

435
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,959
community in chicago we didn't even know

436
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,639
we all lived in the same city

437
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,639
um so we wanted to start something and

438
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,000
talk about what we can do to bring the

439
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,240
community together

440
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
next i would like to take you through

441
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,040
the the growth and what we did over the

442
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,639
years as an example

443
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,199
as a use case example china one we

444
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,279
started in 2013

445
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,519
that was just an informal meeting it was

446
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,680
more of a get to know others

447
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,839
and the community we had no speakers or

448
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,959
any content

449
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,320
we wanted to get the feedback on the

450
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,759
direction of the group and see if there

451
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,600
was any interest

452
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,680
then we had china ii that was our first

453
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,639
meeting with

454
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,040
an actual speaker it was a meet-up type

455
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,160
of an event

456
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
um and that's what started building the

457
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
community with more people attending we

458
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,560
had about 16 or so

459
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,880
then we had china three that was our

460
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,519
second event in 2014

461
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,839
first time we had three speakers and our

462
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,520
attendance doubled and that momentum

463
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,640
started building

464
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,679
we partnered with a new um

465
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,439
ixp being launched in chicago at that

466
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,199
time as well

467
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,559
there were some lessons we learned from

468
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,599
from the event date selection

469
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,439
is critical we scheduled it on a

470
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,240
father's day a weekend

471
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,319
also a weekend it was harder harder for

472
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,600
everyone to attend during the week

473
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,400
we also learned that we have to ensure

474
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,240
there's some nominal registration fee we

475
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,600
had a lot of people that registered that

476
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,559
didn't show up

477
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,600
um so some nominal fee um is

478
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,960
was kind of required to have better

479
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,039
attendance that means schedule is

480
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,520
important

481
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,120
our speaker went a lot longer and we

482
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,200
literally had university security guards

483
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,360
standing outside the door to kick us out

484
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
and close the building

485
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,280
then we had shine for our third event in

486
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
2013

487
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,000
we also had three speakers this was with

488
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
uh with an official sponsor launching

489
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,960
the their chicago ixp it was the first

490
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,799
time we also did t-shirts so that helped

491
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,360
as well

492
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,840
um there was another lesson uh lesson

493
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,559
learned

494
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,559
on the date selection make sure you

495
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,600
don't schedule

496
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,080
uh your event close to your son's birth

497
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,919
we had some false alarms but the baby

498
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,320
came

499
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,760
six days after the event so shineek5 was

500
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,039
the first event

501
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,320
we went to a full day format

502
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,760
our speakers grew to 14. we maxed out

503
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,120
the room capacity and to

504
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,039
close down the registration early on

505
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
with 125 people

506
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,400
after this one we realized we had to

507
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,240
find a venue that could accommodate much

508
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
larger crowd

509
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,799
scheduling date was a lot better this

510
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,720
time we followed another big conference

511
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,880
in town itw with our event

512
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,400
that brought a good number of visitors

513
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
and sponsors we had our share of

514
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,080
challenges over the years

515
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,480
um we're dif which we're definitely

516
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
building the momentum which i'll talk

517
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,799
more about later getting the fun funding

518
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,240
to cover the costs

519
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,559
and finding uh the venues to fit

520
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,240
everyone i'll touch up on these

521
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,960
in the future slides covered 19 also had

522
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,160
a big impact on us

523
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,520
we cancelled um china 10 in 2020

524
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
and weren't able to do a virtual event

525
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,960
yet but we're planning to be back next

526
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,000
year

527
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,480
so what do we currently do every year so

528
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
we have a one annual event

529
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,120
uh doing multiple per years seemed uh

530
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,559
too often especially with the time it

531
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
takes to plan it

532
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,480
our attendance has settled around 200

533
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,240
attendees give or take

534
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,799
usually we shoot for 16 speakers doing

535
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,720
30-minute presentations

536
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,320
in the afternoon we usually have two

537
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,039
tracks to support the event

538
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,120
we have about 11 sponsors of varying

539
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,160
levels from diamond gold and silver

540
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,080
sponsorship break even the cost of the

541
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,919
event

542
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,840
our content is vendor neutral we're

543
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,440
pretty strict about the selection

544
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,080
and adhering to it and i have to

545
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,919
apologize to some of our speakers in the

546
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:52,400
past

547
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,840
over the years pushing back on on that

548
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,000
that point making sure there's is a lot

549
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,200
of logos or

550
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,520
marketing content in there um usually

551
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,799
every event starts with a general

552
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,360
program

553
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
with presentations and ends with a

554
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,520
social gathering that we have

555
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,280
all of our sessions are recorded and

556
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,640
posted on youtube

557
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
now how are we organized so currently we

558
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,000
have a program committee with four

559
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,960
members

560
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,640
uh we have an executive role that does

561
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,880
the funding sponsorship contracts

562
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,000
and social media we also have an event

563
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,679
management company that helps us with

564
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,919
the venue and speaker management

565
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,440
next i want to show a few pictures of

566
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,600
our events you can kind of see the the

567
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,720
growth throughout the year

568
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,320
starting from the second one where it's

569
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
a small group all the way to the eighth

570
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,120
one and

571
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,679
um and you can see the the growth of it

572
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,880
throughout the years

573
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,039
so if you want to start a nog where do

574
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,640
you start

575
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,120
what does it take to start one it

576
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,559
doesn't really take too much to get

577
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,760
started

578
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,200
initially you'll need two to three

579
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
dedicated organizers

580
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,440
doing it along is very hard so try to

581
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,559
find some driven co-workers or friends

582
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,080
next what you want to do is schedule the

583
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,480
first planning meeting for organizers

584
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
this is a very very informal meeting

585
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,880
just for the organizers to set up

586
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,480
things like group name and all these

587
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,880
different next steps we'll talk about

588
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,400
during this meeting you want to

589
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,080
establish a couple of key principles

590
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,360
to follow present vendor neutral content

591
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
this was a very important principle to

592
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
us we want to make sure that the talks

593
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,480
aren't just another marketing

594
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,440
presentations

595
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,880
like you try to sell something also

596
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,200
seek to educate rather than market

597
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,440
product products

598
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
this will go a long way to build the

599
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,320
reputation of the organization

600
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,880
next um set up some online presence you

601
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,760
know for example

602
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,919
have a wordpress site where you can

603
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,320
place all the information the latest

604
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,919
information for everyone to check

605
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,760
you'll have a twitter handle make sure

606
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,440
you use that to communicate

607
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,480
um from the news linkedin group

608
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,400
that's probably one of your best sources

609
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
to find community members

610
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,320
and we'll talk about that next also

611
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,520
youtube channel to post your

612
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
presentations

613
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,760
um slack so um you can use slack to keep

614
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,600
in touch outside of the events but also

615
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,280
during the conference to ask speaker

616
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,840
question

617
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,840
discuss content and kind of have things

618
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,799
offline

619
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,720
next you want to start building a local

620
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
community spreading the word of the

621
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
group

622
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,639
which we'll cover next

623
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,559
so how do you how do you actually go

624
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,880
about building a local community

625
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,440
this is this is the majority of the

626
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,039
groundwork for the organizers

627
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,960
until you build a good momentum this is

628
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,440
what most organizers will be doing

629
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,159
you'll you'll want to ask co-workers

630
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,120
former

631
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,520
colleagues and use your social network

632
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,799
you want to seek out people

633
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,360
via social media professional websites

634
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,440
to invite them to the meetings

635
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,000
for example i would look up people that

636
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,760
were network engineers

637
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,720
or as a title had certain certifications

638
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,640
such as ccies

639
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
send them invites to our events some

640
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,760
will get ignored

641
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,879
some will gain traction

642
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,919
also to help you you can also get help

643
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:04,240
from

644
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
already established national

645
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
organizations this is where groups like

646
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,320
nanog

647
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,480
shynog might be able to help and we'll

648
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,640
talk more about that

649
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,559
uh you also want to announce your events

650
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,200
on mailing lists you'll want to announce

651
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,799
save the date when you're having the

652
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,720
event call for speakers what you're

653
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,159
looking for

654
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,640
what type of speakers also once you have

655
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,480
the agenda and any details

656
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,480
on the date and location also

657
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,760
once you get to the point of having

658
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,720
sponsors also help them

659
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,440
ask them for help advertising events um

660
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
it brings them benefit

661
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,400
um to to obviously have more people

662
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,840
attend as well

663
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,120
uh and they might be able to send

664
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,279
messages to their local contacts within

665
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,000
the region

666
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,520
also posted on their social media

667
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,559
um you might also want to search based

668
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,000
on technical certification or

669
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,279
professional titles

670
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,279
um so you might be searching for network

671
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,919
engineers ccies jncis

672
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,760
network architects or other other titles

673
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,559
and linkedin was a great tool for that

674
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,520
you want to reach out to local

675
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,360
universities they might have an alumni

676
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,400
group

677
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,159
professors could keep in touch with

678
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,520
graduates

679
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,200
invite students to get them interested

680
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,120
in industry as well

681
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,960
and building the local community is one

682
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
of the hardest parts of the organizing

683
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
a local nog but at the end is the most

684
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,360
rewarding it will take creativity

685
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,200
that will slowly grow and build momentum

686
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,120
becoming easier throughout each

687
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,720
event next you'll want to organize the

688
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,799
first community meeting

689
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,799
the first community meeting basically

690
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,320
just to get started and announce the

691
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,960
group

692
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,440
it's very informal usually small group

693
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
10 people or so

694
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,880
meet and greet everyone that's

695
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,799
interested get some feedback on the

696
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,760
direction of the group and gather ideas

697
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,080
um you might also brainstorm ideas on

698
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,880
what to do

699
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,559
the next meeting like watching party

700
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,799
with videos of other conferences

701
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,480
you may also ask for speakers ideas

702
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,600
to present the other thing

703
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,880
you'd want to get a good idea of the

704
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
audience this is mostly an audience that

705
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,320
that works in service provider

706
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
enterprise cloud industry

707
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,360
it's also a good place to ask for

708
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,919
volunteers and most importantly

709
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,760
don't forget to celebrate uh

710
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,200
accomplishing the first step

711
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,840
in starting the note which is it is

712
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
next i'd like to quickly talk about uh

713
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,400
some of the growing phases of a dog

714
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,559
not my might follow these phases a

715
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,679
meetup phase

716
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,919
a full day conference phase a multi-day

717
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:32,720
phase

718
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,240
most knowledge will be successful in the

719
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,960
meetup phase

720
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,880
so when you talk about a meetup phase uh

721
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,200
in terms of the content you have about

722
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,320
three presenters live or recorded

723
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,440
with some dedicated networking time um

724
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,200
organizers will be doing most of the

725
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,440
seeking out to get the presenters

726
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,120
um and events are usually held during

727
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,840
the weekday in the evenings have to work

728
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,440
meeting venue

729
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,480
could be someone's office conference

730
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,799
room university hall or a library

731
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,919
usually you're probably going to be

732
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,640
around 20 to 40 attendees

733
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,960
style is informal but structured where

734
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,640
you have some schedule

735
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,760
costs like beer pizza or something very

736
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,480
small

737
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,880
you don't really need sponsors for this

738
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
and a frequency

739
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,840
you would want to do three times a year

740
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
to kind of build that momentum

741
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,440
at this point you could say mission

742
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
accomplished you have a non if you get

743
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,799
this far

744
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,200
that's that's all it takes um now back

745
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,640
to the use case of shannon

746
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
um we had china two three and four in

747
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,159
this meetup phase

748
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,600
and again our goal was to build the

749
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,679
momentum and grow the community

750
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,360
so next you would move to the full day

751
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,760
phase this is where your content you

752
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,919
have uh 10 to 12 live speakers

753
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,600
you can do a single track or split the

754
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,960
track um

755
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,400
you still have organizers reaching out

756
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,000
to speakers but you can also rely a

757
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,039
little bit more on call for

758
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,720
presentations

759
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,799
meeting venue because it is a lot larger

760
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,559
you're talking about 50 to 200 people

761
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,159
you would need to start

762
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,279
looking at hotel conference rooms this

763
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,960
is more formal and structured you have

764
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,200
specific time and schedule to follow

765
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,600
and the costs are significant um

766
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,279
significantly more because of the

767
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,279
the venue also food and beverages have

768
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,360
significant costs as well

769
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,279
room rental and ap and you're talking

770
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,200
about anywhere from 50 to 100

771
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,520
000k you definitely need sponsors at

772
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,039
this point you need to come up with

773
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,760
packages to cover these costs

774
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,480
in terms of frequency um once a year you

775
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,159
can do it once a year since organizing

776
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,279
is a lot of planning

777
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,880
um you could outsource something event

778
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,120
planning and again going back to

779
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
shannock use case um phi was the first

780
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,640
one that we went

781
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,360
with a full day we used the universal

782
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,960
university conferencing center

783
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,520
as our venue then we had to move to much

784
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,240
bigger hotels

785
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,399
and then again for a full day event you

786
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,520
might want to plan

787
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,720
eight months to a year in advance when

788
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,399
you knock enters a more structured group

789
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,279
usually

790
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,960
when doing a full day event there are

791
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
additional things you want to consider

792
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
such as having committees or more

793
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,559
dedicated volunteer for these

794
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,159
responsibilities

795
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,080
and these are basically like a program

796
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,679
committee marketing

797
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,880
finance budget and sponsor development

798
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,480
so i won't read all that but um

799
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,120
you could either have um certain people

800
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,640
main organizers take on these

801
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,840
responsibilities

802
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,080
um or you could have volunteers and

803
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,880
slowly build

804
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,240
committees for that

805
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,840
with a full day event you need to

806
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,120
consider a few things like having a

807
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
separate business entity to handle the

808
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,919
contract

809
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,840
uh taxes and finances so within the us

810
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,360
they're count two main options one is

811
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,200
setting up an llc the other one is a

812
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,960
nonprofit

813
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,120
lsc is very quick to set up not a lot of

814
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,720
restrictions around it but it does have

815
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,399
tax implications

816
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,320
nonprofit is a little bit harder to set

817
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,559
up need to formalize the appointment of

818
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,080
a board

819
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,720
but lesser tax implications for the

820
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,679
organizers

821
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,919
now quick disclaimers i'm not definitely

822
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,520
not giving you legal advice here

823
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,240
um you have to be crazy to trust me on

824
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,440
that one

825
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,880
um you also need to consider funding um

826
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,960
sponsorship packages uh you'll need to

827
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,159
come up with something

828
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,720
basically the per person cost goes up

829
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,440
significantly

830
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,320
could be anywhere from 150 to 250 for

831
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,760
food and beverages

832
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,520
um you would want to have the sponsors

833
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,200
cover the majority of the

834
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,320
event where you develop different levels

835
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,360
such as gold

836
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,080
diamond and silver you would want to

837
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,279
define these

838
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,799
sponsorship benefits clearly and ensure

839
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,159
that there's a separation

840
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,440
from the presented content and in terms

841
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,760
of ticket sales

842
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,039
you want to make sure that the amount is

843
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,720
big enough to ensure attendees actually

844
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,240
show up when they register but low

845
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,760
enough for everyone

846
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,200
to attend so the next phase

847
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,600
um the last phase this is i'm not going

848
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,440
to be in a multi-day event this is what

849
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,720
nanak does

850
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,320
again in terms of content it's

851
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,760
multi-track

852
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,679
meeting venue is a large hotel room

853
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,080
where you have more than 200

854
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,360
500 a thousand attendees style again

855
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,960
it's formally structured everything's

856
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,720
kind of scheduled

857
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,360
cost a lot more than a single day event

858
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,799
some of the other things you have to

859
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,279
look at

860
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,840
is uh room rental blocks and you can

861
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,279
talk about anywhere from a hundred

862
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,880
thousand dollars or more

863
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
sponsorships sponsors you will need

864
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
sponsors but you need to raise

865
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,440
a lot more potentially three times more

866
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,039
frequency you can do it once a year

867
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,559
three times a year but if you

868
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,919
if you if you're doing it three times a

869
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,159
year you need to hire staff or outsource

870
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,200
it

871
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,679
so so far we talked about uh why and how

872
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,840
to start a non with the use case of how

873
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,640
china

874
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,880

started on their own

877
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,559
we would like to pilot a non-blueprint

878
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,520
program

879
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,600
