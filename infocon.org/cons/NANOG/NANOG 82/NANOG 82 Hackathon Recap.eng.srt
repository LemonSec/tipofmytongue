welcome to the nanak 82

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,679
virtual hackathon i'm really excited to

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,200
be here i'm sitting

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,240
with participants and organizers michael

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,360
costello is a

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,840
nano committee chair as well as netflix

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,760
director of engineering

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,720
michael go ahead and tell me what you're

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,400
most impressed by with this year's

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,519
hackathon

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,160
thanks elizabeth like most hackathons

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,960
i'm

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,519
continue to be impressed by a number of

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,000
people

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,920
show up and they spend their weekend

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,239
working on on hard problems when they

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,079
could be spending their weekend doing

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,040
anything else uh they come in here they

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,480
they show vulnerability

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,000
and that they don't know everything that

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,920
are willing to learn they're willing to

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,360
meet other people and rise to the

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,440
challenge to learn something new

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
what did you find most challenging

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,559
during this process

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,000
jeff i'm going to throw this question to

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,440
you and go ahead and introduce yourself

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,160
to everyone hi i'm jeff barteg i'm a

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,280
network architect for internet2

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
and i'm a member of the program

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,080
committee and the hackathon subcommittee

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,080
uh i think the for the

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
organizers i think a big challenge was

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,200
that

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,920
we looked at a completely new way of

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,560
offering

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
virtual labs this time uh we're using

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,479
container lab

40
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,920
and so leading up to the hackathon

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,720
members of the the team put a lot of

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,360
effort into making sure that worked well

43
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,880
uh steve tell me what is most different

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,439
as jeff had mentioned we're now we're

45
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,119
doing this remotely as opposed to being

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,960
in a large room together

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,680
uh due to the pandemic what other in

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,560
what other ways

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
has hackathon changed over the years

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,320
over the past few years past many years

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
perhaps struggled with trying to define

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,399
what we want the hackathon to be

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
we've gone back and forth between it

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,560
being very free form

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,159
we just invite people into a room give

56
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,159
them some power

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,079
and network and tell them to go build

58
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,439
something to

59
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,320
having a very prescribed uh almost a

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,800
training course type of event

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,920
the pendulum has swung back more toward

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
do it on your own but here's a set of

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
tools and a theme you can use to

64
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
organize around if you want to

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
i personally really enjoyed this the way

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,440
it was done this time because i

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
let me sort of develop on the fly what i

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,640
wanted to do and go ahead and do it at

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,599
my own pace

70
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,319
um changing from in person in a single

71
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,680
room to virtual

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,800
has brought a whole new set of

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
challenges and we spent a good part of

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,160
last year trying to figure out

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,720
how to deal with it and i think we've

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,560
settled on something pretty good here

77
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,120
biggest surprise to me but also the

78
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,840
greatest thing

79
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,879
is that by going virtual we have a lot

80
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,400
of people from all over the world to

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,160
come in and

82
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,599
contribute and collaborate i mean just

83
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,920
look at the tony and barry team

84
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,400
this is their third hackathon in a row

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,280
um where

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,800
they're sitting pretty much at opposite

87
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,239
ends of the world and working on

88
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,000
something together i think that's great

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
prior to this we're just an organizer so

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,040
this one is kind of an

91
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,560
extra special event because you

92
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,159
participated for the first time is that

93
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,720
correct

94
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,519
yeah it is um and it was great for me

95
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,040
because i got to see

96
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,080
the other side finally um and i found a

97
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,319
way to do something fun

98
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,200
at the same time uh i did to get to talk

99
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,879
to michael about how this is such a

100
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,640
passion sport can you talk more about

101
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,440
that

102
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,879
i mentioned during my presentation

103
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,840
earlier that i love to learn new things

104
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,959
um and this gives me a way of doing that

105
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,640
in bite-sized chunks where i can pick up

106
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
some new technologies play with them and

107
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,080
see where things lead um the fact that

108
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
everybody here was willing to give up

109
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
most of their weekend to do this

110
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,319
like as michael said is an amazing thing

111
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,680
um it means that we're

112
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,879
all passionate about um

113
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,480
what we do the technology the

114
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,319
educational aspects of it

115
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,400
and uh and to be honest with social

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,439
aspects as well

117
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,879
so my project ended up being to install

118
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,959
an autobot container um use that to

119
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,959
create some sort of truth data

120
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,560
and then write a screen script that

121
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,239
would use that data to

122
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,519
uh use gnmi to update router configs

123
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,879
this is what i had to do in container

124
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,560
lab to get it running

125
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,920
i added exactly these lines to the

126
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,079
container lab config and it came up and

127
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,040
it ran

128
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,279
the only little bit of magic here is

129
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,479
this bind

130
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,560
statement which let me create a

131
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,639
directory

132
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,720
on the host system which was shared

133
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
amongst all of the containers i added

134
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
this to the uh

135
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
excuse me to the linux containers as

136
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
well um so i made

137
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,800
sharing code amongst them very easy so

138
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
this here is the

139
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,320
autobot main screen um so i created

140
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,400
two whole devices which i will show you

141
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,360
here so these the ceos device and the

142
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,240
srl nokia device so here's the four

143
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,000
interfaces on the device

144
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,639
descriptions and ip addresses what i

145
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,199
ended up

146
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,800
being able to automate in the time i had

147
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,280
was updating the interface descriptions

148
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,400
on the devices from what not about

149
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,479
claims there's a source of truth here

150
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,520
so if i go to well first i'll go to this

151
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,560
window um

152
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
all i'm doing is show interfaces

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,120
descriptions so you can see the

154
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
descriptions here

155
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,960
should match uh what's here in the

156
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,919
autobot

157
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,759
um i'll go to this window which is one

158
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,639
of the centos containers on the uh

159
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,840
in the lab and i'll run dot slash

160
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,759
update descriptions and it's going to

161
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,120
read through

162
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,080
uh notobot um looking at all the devices

163
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,039
looking at the

164
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,039
configurations on the devices so it says

165
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,120
that the descriptions don't need to be

166
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,240
changed because they match what's on the

167
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
device so i'm going to go here

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,880
and i am going to change let's see i

169
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
will edit the loopback interface

170
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,960
and change it to

171
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,120
demo demo time

172
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,440
and update so you can see that it's

173
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,080
updated here um so i'm going to go here

174
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
run my script again

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,080
takes a little bit of a moment okay so

176
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
here you can see that it had to

177
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,039
update the description loop x0 now if i

178
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:09,919
go to

179
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,360
the actual device and do show interfaces

180
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
description

181
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
again you can see that it was set to

182
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,319
demo time

183
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,520
the big thing that i came out of this

184
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,880
with is that there are so many tools

185
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,919
that let you put together

186
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,759
bits and pieces of things in useful ways

187
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,960
and play with them

188
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,479
um it's just a matter of learning the

189
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,400
tools and finding the time to dig when

190
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,360
you want to

191
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,960
what are you most excited about for

192
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
future hackathons i'm really impressed

193
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
with the pace

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,639
at which we've seen the the lab

195
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,919
environments improve

196
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,639
um you know pretend you know i've been

197
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,120
i've been

198
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,560
networking for 20 some years now and

199
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
you know you know starting with you know

200
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
here is your here's your hardware to

201
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,919
play with go in and connect to things

202
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,759
to to uh to a system where you can

203
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,400
more or less spin up any topology you

204
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,360
want

205
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,840
run whatever tools grab them and you

206
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,120
know and

207
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,759
the ease of which tools can be spun up

208
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,400
and deployed

209
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,120
topologies can be deployed i'm i'm only

210
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,199
looking to see that improving

211
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,400
and with that i'm seeing i'm seeing a

212
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
lot of opportunities for

213
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,000
teams to maybe maybe not so much

214
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,919
develop a lot of their own code but just

215
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,680
figure out interesting ways of putting

216
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
tools together

217
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,960
in different tool chains and different

218
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,400
combinations

219
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,440
uh to make to make some interesting uh

220
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,479
systems happen

221
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,919
you know we've seen that a few times

222
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,680
where you know and a lot a lot of the

223
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,400
hacks we see you know yeah we took we

224
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,599
took this project

225
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,919
and and made a plug-in to make it talk

226
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,800
to this one

227
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,319
and just putting the glue between a lot

228
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,039
of existing stuff um

229
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,319
and and and then and

230
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,599
the nice thing about that is that you

231
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,759
know you can say all right you know

232
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,960
i'm not going to build everything from

233
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
scratch there's a lot of technology out

234
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,000
there

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
maybe not all of it is intended for

236
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,319
network engineers a lot of it is

237
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,120
a lot of it um is geared towards systems

238
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,599
but

239
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,599
the the law between network systems

240
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,720
and services um and

241
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,919
running running software as web services

242
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,960
apis

243
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,680
um that's starting to get fuzzy enough

244
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
that a lot of things can apply to both

245
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,400
and that's really exciting to see

246
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
what what people are gonna do with that

247
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,240
next as

248
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,280
you know as those uh as that those lines

249
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,599
continue to blur even further um so

250
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,958
coming into this

251
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,760
hackathon you basically have shared a

252
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,240
whole

253
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,039
new evolution of tools starting with

254
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,240
continued labs

255
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,839
so this is the um this is the topology

256
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,959
that is running off

257
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,399
of my uh

258
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,000
sort of um virtual

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,720
lab you can see that it's

260
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,839
it it all comes alive on a very

261
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
bare minimum resources so this is a four

262
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,360
gig

263
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,560
um virtual instance

264
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,600
uh off to a main host of windows

265
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
and you can see that it is hardly using

266
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
half of it

267
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,800
the lab itself the way it gets

268
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,839
constructed

269
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,680
is pretty much all these demands that i

270
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,519
was able to run in

271
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,839
of course you need docker support uh you

272
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,760
would need to have

273
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,440
the right docker ce uh

274
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
instance for the kind of ubuntu that

275
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,279
you're running the guide was talking

276
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,959
about focal length using

277
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,320
pursuit so and then um

278
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,760
of that once we are done with docker c

279
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,880
implementation

280
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,080
then f of r fr lab

281
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,800
instances they were you know they were

282
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,760
pretty easy to

283
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,600
spin up because it does provide you with

284
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,279
pcs uh

285
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,480
uh with a login to uh ehl

286
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,160
as well as to a router login to vty sh

287
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,200
all right tony who is all the way

288
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,440
in south africa thank you so much for

289
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,560
joining us

290
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,839
how are you doing today tony hi um i'm

291
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,079
doing good thank you how are you

292
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,959
i'm very well uh so has it been a long

293
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,519
weekend for you

294
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,880
um not so much um but it's been it's

295
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,519
been good

296
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,279
it's been it's been a great experience

297
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,640
as

298
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
the last few have been why should

299
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,800
someone participate in the future

300
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,920
um well i think

301
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,680
for me um i think

302
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,480
coming from south africa for instance um

303
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,200
you know

304
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,560
like we a lot of people would

305
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,959
uh would like always be fascinated by

306
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,640
what's happening in the us

307
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,320
uh closer to silicon valley um and

308
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
what's always fascinating to me is that

309
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
the access to knowledge to information

310
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,279
to the internet is all the same

311
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
so you know working with people from

312
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
different organizations

313
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,959
uh well-known organizations that we get

314
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,160
to collaborate

315
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
on the same problems and solve the same

316
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
problems um

317
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,160
kind of highlights uh the fact that we

318
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,480
are

319
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,320
a whole lot more unified and there isn't

320
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,839
a lot that separates us

321
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,880
so for me that is is

322
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
enough for anyone else to just come and

323
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,079
participate

324
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,000
and see what other people are working on

325
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,279
and you find out that

326
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,440
we kind of are all working on solving

327
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,560
the same things

328
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,839
is this your first hackathon no it is

329
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,320
not

330
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,680
um i have been participating since

331
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,000
october of 2020 that was my first

332
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,079
hackathon and there i met tony and we

333
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,680
started to work together

334
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,720
and have been working together for three

335
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,360
hackathons now if you count this one

336
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,880
wow that's amazing so what drew you to a

337
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,839
specific topic

338
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,959
you chose well i've been wanting to

339
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,399
focus more on network automation and

340
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,120
uh network scaling as well as network

341
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,760
management

342
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,279
so um i was drawn to the idea of

343
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,120
being able to take the streaming

344
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,399
telemetry

345
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,920
uh the the stream of data and

346
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,440
do something useful with it you do seem

347
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
to learn a lot in a small

348
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,079
span of time yeah it was a

349
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,120
fun 48 hours like yeah like a ton tony

350
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,240
said i

351
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,760
i went to bed at six in the morning

352
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,519
today um

353
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,399
i'm learning bus so i i just wanted to

354
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,480
to get that working out of the way

355
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,079
most of the hackathons that i've

356
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,519
participated in have

357
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
always been successful so um

358
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,320
for me um it was just that in my

359
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,839
previous roles

360
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,320
um i'd never had the chance to come to

361
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,040
nanak

362
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,320
so um i think that the first

363
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
time that i attended it was a good

364
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
opportunity one because it was

365
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,880
uh i could join online and

366
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
also uh having been in the midst of

367
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,399
lockdowns and restrictions it was a good

368
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
way to travel without leaving my

369
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,920
my home oh definitely

370
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,360
yeah and socialize yeah yeah

371
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,760
yeah so yeah so i think it

372
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,800
one thing about you know the pandemic

373
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,600
was that

374
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,160
we we kind of have been able to actually

375
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,720
reach

376
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,839
each other uh even more seamlessly

377
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,079
uh ironically enough um uh from from the

378
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,760
comfort of our home and i don't

379
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,040
and for me that um if if

380
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
things were as normal i probably would

381
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,639
have had something else more important

382
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,360
to do

383
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,760
so so um that that was a good

384
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,160
opportunity for me

385
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,279
that's really interesting that the

386
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,360
pandemic opened up this door for

387
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,279
you guys to respond and find camaraderie

388
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,560

389
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,079
