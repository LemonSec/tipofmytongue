00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,159
participant i joined the nanak mailing

83
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,120
list

84
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,239

presentation in 1996.

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,760
uh for me nanog has always been about

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,480
community us coming together the people

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,760
that are building the digital

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,560
infrastructure

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,720
especially around networking and

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,000
education we teach

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,760
each other and we teach each other and

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,599
we build this community

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,560
formally there's presentations uh and

96
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
content that you can

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,519
uh when it's physical go to and

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,959
otherwise look at

99
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,040
you can interact and i encourage you to

100
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,440
ask questions and it's also informal

101
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
some of that is been the hallway track

102
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,200
which we've done in person

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,239
and uh is now more virtual uh

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,799
with this now i'll tell you a little bit

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,840
about kentick

106
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,120
who is sponsoring uh this nethog

107
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,680
so as a little bit of background kentic

108
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,760
is a network observability company

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
we make a service that helps the people

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
that build the infrastructure especially

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,879
the internet

112
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,840
and the services on top go we take a

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,599
wide kind of telemetry from

114
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
all different kinds of network and we

115
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,040
tell people

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,880
uh give them recommendations about

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,280
performance and security and things that

118
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,160
they can do

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
our customers are service providers

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,520
enterprises

121
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,720
and everyone in between nanolog itself

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,000
has a diverse kind of uh networking

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
represented a diverse set of folks

124
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,840
building the internet

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
the services the sas services the cloud

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
and the other infrastructure

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,120
and in today's world doing network

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,639
observability really understanding

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,080
what's going on has gotten harder

130
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,600
because of this complexity

131
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,840
whether it's performance or security or

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
engineering

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,520
we think that observability to do it

134
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,639
really well

135
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,320
means seeing all the different kinds of

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
network that you own or are

137
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
using uh taking a wide view of telemetry

138
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
being able to understand that with

139
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,800
context and then being able to interact

140
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
with it well

141
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
getting insights and driving with

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,160
actions and integrating with automation

143
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
uh that's what we've built it's a cloud

144
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
service

145
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
it takes lots of different kinds of

146
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,520
telemetry from many different kinds of

147
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,080
infrastructure then also adds context so

148
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,680
not only your bgp

149
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
but your application orchestration your

150
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,880
user

151
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,120
data so you can really understand

152
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,000
performance

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,440
security availability by type of traffic

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,320
and by type of infrastructure you may

155
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,639
know

156
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,840
kentic as uh a product that

157
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
launched with a lot of functionality on

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,680
peering transit interconnection

159
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,320
the core of nanog what's new uh that

160
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,759
you're welcome to talk to us about

161
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,440
drop by the booth is around performance

162
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,680
testing a lot of cloud functionality

163
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
whether performance or cost

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,479
understanding and auditing uh transit

165
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,199
and land costs across your network a lot

166
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,639
about automation

167
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,400
some portal access for both service

168
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
providers and enterprise

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,919
bgp monitoring which we've launched as

170
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,280
part of synthetics to understand

171
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,199
hijacking and how you're reached

172
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,360
and then a lot of integrations uh as we

190
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,800
i am the current chair of the nanochrome

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,360
committee

192
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,160
so for nanog82 we have 13 peer-reviewed

193
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,400
presentations including our keynote

194
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,520
the nanak permanent committee is

195
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
comprised of 26 members and we're in

196
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,639
charge of moderating the program

197
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,560
sessions and the networking sessions

198
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,039
we're a self-governing group some notes

199
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,000
for the program

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
for the virtual chat make sure that you

201
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
use the chat tab to talk with other

202
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,319
attendees

203
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,160
the question answer tab is for asking

204
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,919
questions during your presentation

205
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,759
and then the help tab is to get and

206
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,280
receive technical support

207
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,919
during the conference on the agenda on

208
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,120
the website you will also find the

209
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
presentation materials with the speaker

210
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,080
slides

211
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,440
and don't forget that we will have a

212
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
newcomers woman in tech and birds of

213
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
feather networking sessions on zoom

214
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,400
those links will also be on the agenda

215
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,479
on the website looking back we wanted to

216
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,520
highlight some of the virtual

217
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,720
improvements we've made over the last

218
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,840
several conferences

219
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
this conference is our fourth virtual

220
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,440
conference so nanox 79

221
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,720
80 81 and this 182 have all been virtual

222
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,080
some of the lessons learned and

223
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,360
improvements we've made have been that

224
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
pre-recordings have definitely been the

225
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
way to go whenever possible

226
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
this removes any issues we have with

227
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
streaming uh microphones etc because

228
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,039
we're able to

229
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,319
fine-tune cut out um errors etc

230
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,759
we also know the exact timing of our

231
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,199
presentations when we pre-record which

232
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,400
makes it a lot easier to slaughter

233
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,520
agendas

234
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,720
we've been working really hard on

235
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,800
pre-defined speaker introductions

236
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,080
so no longer does somebody have to come

237
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,759
up and we just say oh here's joe and

238
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,120
he's going to talk to you for the next

239
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,319
30 minutes now we have a good

240
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,280
introduction

241
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,240
talking about their previous

242
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
presentations if they've had any

243
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,919
talking about if they're new to nano

244
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,440
where they're from what their history is

245
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,639
in the networking world

246
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,000
so you get a better idea of who you're

247
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,680
hearing from on each of the talks

248
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
we've also been working on running

249
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,560
scripts for our moderators again just to

250
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
make the transitions much easier and

251
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,960
smoother

252
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
and talking points for our moderators to

253
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
help remind you about things coming up

254
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,599
like the breakout sessions

255
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,000
future talks etc we've also done a lot

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,679
of new features in the pc tool to

257
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,279
support those above features which have

258
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:37,679
made

259
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,240
the job of the pc much easier come back

260
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,679
to our community meeting on wednesday

261
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,200
for a lot more details on all of these

262
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
bits

263
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,279
more lessons learned continued um so

264
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,120
submit your your presentations early

265
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,640
provide your slides early

266
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,000
we've been doing rolling submissions

267
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
which means we're also enrolling

268
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,399
acceptances

269
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,480
so the sooner we get your toxin the

270
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,600
sooner you have a chance of being

271
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
accepted which also means the sooner you

272
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
can pre-record your talk

273
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,000
and as i mentioned on the prior slide

274
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
when we have pre-recorded talks this

275
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,440
allows us to better time the agenda stop

276
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,399
things correctly

277
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,839
so that we know and make sure there's

278
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,160
enough time for question and answer

279
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,600
we've also formally split up the

280
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
shepherd and content review rules

281
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,279
um this year so the shepherds will still

282
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,560
be the people that guide you through the

283
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,920
whole process from start to finish on

284
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,880
the firm committee

285
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,480
the content reviewer now is the person

286
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,839
who's specifically in charge of making

287
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,120
sure your slides have good formatting

288
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,480
that they're free of typos

289
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,000
and then they also assist in collecting

290
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,279
and creating your speaker introduction

291
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,720
information for the

292
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
