00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,080
hello

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,480
my name is vince circ i'm vice president

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,719
and chief internet evangelist at google

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,080
since 2005 and i'm sure i know many of

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,719
you and

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,400
many of you must know me i've been

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,640
around for quite a long time now

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,960
having started working on computer

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,880
networking with the arpanet project way

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,720
back in 1969

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,400
when i was still a graduate student at

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,640
ucla lots of things have happened in

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,760
between

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,880
and in particular uh an aspiration began

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
in 1998 to develop a solar system-wide

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,200
internet and that's what this talk is

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,640
all about

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,680
so let's uh let's start out just by

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,640
reminding you

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,280
that the first demonstration of the

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,120
internet capability

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,760
of the serious demonstration came in

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,039
1977 when i was at arpa

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,520
running the program as a program manager

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,239
and wanted very much to show by

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,359
demonstration that

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,480
tcpip protocols would actually work

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,559
with different kinds of packet switch

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,119
networks different data rates different

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,439
you know packet sizes different latency

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,119
different error rates

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
and so this diagram shows you what we

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,759
did in november of

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,640
77 we had a mobile packet radio van

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,080
driving up and down the bay shore

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
freeway

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
in a packet radio network system that

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,000
was operated by sri

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
international that van was radiating

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,280
packets that went through a gateway

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,439
into the arpanet which went all the way

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,640
across the us

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,320
and the atlantic through an internal

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,240
satellite hop to norway and then a land

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,600
line down to

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,479
university college london uh at which

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,439
point it popped

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,640
out of the arpanet in the uk went

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,079
through a gateway

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,280
uh at the at ucl and then to ground

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,880
station at goon hilly downs and

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,759
up across the packet satellite network

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,680
to etam west virginia where there was

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,799
another ground station

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,280
and then popped out into another gateway

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,159
and then

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,439
all the way across the country to usc

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,759
information sciences institute in marina

60
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,280
del rey california

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,319
so the packet radio van and marina del

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,120
rey are about 400 miles apart

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,720
uh so the packets that were going

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,599
across the atlantic and across the u.s

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
and back and forth

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,280
to europe and went about a hundred

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
thousand miles because they were going

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
through two synchronous satellite hops

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,599
which

70
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,160
you'll remember is like 22 000 miles up

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,200
and down that's 44 times 2 is 88

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,599
plus back and forth across the uh the us

73
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,040
and the atlantic so

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
we're talking about a hundred thousand

75
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
miles and it actually worked

76
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,480
and i remember you know leaping up and

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,760
down my office in

78
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,599
in the dc area saying it works it works

79
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,040
you know like it couldn't possibly

80
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,840
work and that's because it's software

81
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,680
and it's always a miracle when software

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
works so this for me

83
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,239
was a very important date demonstrating

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,200
that the internet protocols which had

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
begun as an

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,840
idea in 1973 when bobcat and i began

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,040
thinking about this

88
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
to the point where we had a practical

89
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,159
demonstration

90
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
and then another four or five years went

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,959
by as we implemented these protocols on

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,000
every operating system

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,319
we could get our hands on so that was a

94
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,440
very important

95
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
milestone and then of course we look at

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
the internet today

97
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
and what we see are hundreds of

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
thousands of networks including the ones

99
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,480
that operate in your homes

100
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,760
uh and offices uh like the one i'm using

101
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,120
right now which is uh

102
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
a nice six or seven hundred megabit uh

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,799
connection

104
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,319
uh to uh to the uh internet backbone

105
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,799
what i intended to show with this chart

106
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,000
which is actually fairly

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,640
old it was done in 1999 as it's a

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,920
rendering of the

109
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,080
border gateway protocol backbone routing

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,519
forwarding tables

111
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,439
the point about the different colors is

112
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,720
that there are literally

113
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
hundreds of thousands of networks that

114
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
are operating each independently of each

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,599
other

116
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,280
each of them with whatever software and

117
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,360
hardware the operators choose

118
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,840
whatever business model they choose and

119
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,519
whoever they want to connect to

120
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,599
is their negotiation on a pairwise basis

121
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,519
so this is highly distributed there is

122
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,759
no central control the only thing that's

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,798
central in this

124
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,680
system is the operation of the internet

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
corporation for assigned names and

126
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
numbers which is responsible for making

127
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,000
sure that i p

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,240
address space and domain name

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,759
assignments are done

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,919
on a unique basis so we don't assign the

131
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,520
same ip address to two different

132
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,720
networks or

133
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,880
the same domain name the two different

134
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,000
operators

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,759
but that's the only element of

136
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,000
coordination in the system otherwise

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
it's highly distributed so this has

138
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
turned out to be a very powerful tool

139
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
we've seen all the benefits and some of

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
the harmful

141
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,919
difficulties with misinformation and

142
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,080
disinformation the question though

143
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,280
is could we do something like that

144
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,800
in space so in 1997

145
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,360
uh some of you will recall that the

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,320
pathfinder

147
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,919
uh robot was landed on mars successfully

148
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,400
after a 20-year gap because in 1976

149
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,280
two viking landers arrived on mars sent

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
by

151
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,919
nasa and then for 20 years nothing

152
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,680
worked you know things didn't make it to

153
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,600
the planet or they crashed and all kinds

154
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
of other bad things happened

155
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,840
until 97 when the pathfinder arrived and

156
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,960
so

157
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
shortly thereafter i met with a team at

158
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,520
the jet propulsion laboratory

159
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
and we began talking about what we

160
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,600
should be thinking of doing

161
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,400
that would be important and necessary 25

162
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,199
years later

163
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,320
so we were thinking in 2023 or

164
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
thereabouts

165
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
way back in 1998 and our conclusion was

166
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,360
why don't we think about building a

167
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,199
network that could operate across the

168
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,960
entire solar system

169
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,639
in order to provide communications

170
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,800
capability for both manned and robotic

171
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,160
spacecraft

172
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,120
so that is what launched us into a

173
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
discussion about interplanetary

174
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
networking

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,880
uh there were a number of spacecraft

176
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,520
that came

177
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,039
after the sojourner and pathfinder

178
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,000
initiative in 97 and the most important

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,720
one

180
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,360
following that was the arrival of spirit

181
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
and opportunity

182
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,199
on mars in january of 2004

183
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,160
those two spacecraft were intended to

184
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,199
transmit data

185
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,000
directly back to earth to what's called

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,840
the deep space network these are

187
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,400
three 70 meter dishes that are located

188
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,880
at uh

189
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,800
in australia in spain and in california

190
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,880
so that even as the earth turns we have

191
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
this these big

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,599
antennas that can look out into the

193
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,680
solar system and communicate with

194
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,000
various spacecraft so that was the plan

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
the data rate that would

196
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,440
have been available for the direct to

197
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
earth path from the surface of mars

198
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,919
back to the deep space net was about 28

199
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,440
kilobits a second

200
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,120
which left the scientists a little

201
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,639
grumpy

202
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,400
then when we actually started

203
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,160
transmitting data

204
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
using that system we noticed that the

205
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,840
radios were

206
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,479
overheating and so that led the

207
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,319
engineers to say we should back off on

208
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,160
the duty cycle and of course that made

209
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,400
the scientists even more grumpy

210
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,599
but then it was noticed or

211
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,599
pointed out by one of the engineers at

212
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,680
jpl that there was a

213
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,319
another radio on board that could

214
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,880
communicate directly with the orbiters

215
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,599
that had been sent to mars beforehand in

216
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,919
order to map the surface of mars

217
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,160
in order to figure out where the rover

218
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
should go

219
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,199
so they were still in orbit and they

220
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,960
were still they had power they had

221
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,000
programmable capability at computing

222
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,360
um they had communications and so

223
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,479
we uploaded the jpl team uploaded

224
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,080
a sort of prototype store and forward

225
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,520
software package in order to hold the

226
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,240
data

227
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,280
in the rovers that they had collected

228
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
until an orbiter got overhead and they

229
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,360
escort the data up to the orbiter and it

230
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
would hang on to the data

231
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
until it got to the right place in its

232
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,280
orbit to transmit data back to the deep

233
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,599
space network now the good news

234
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,680
is that because the distance between the

235
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
rover on the surface and the orbiter was

236
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
only a few hundred miles uh we could

237
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,440
actually get

238
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
better signal to noise ratio on that

239
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,960
channel and so we could transmit

240
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,240
128 kilobits a second the orbiter

241
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,958
is out of the mars atmosphere as thin as

242
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
it is and it has bigger

243
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,919
you know solar power so it could

244
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,679
transmit data back to the deep space

245
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,560
network also at 128 kilobits a second so

246
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
we got four times more data right by

247
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
going store and forward

248
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,320
so we were able to demonstrate the

249
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,880
utility of packet switching

250
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,480
to the space exploration community

251
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
by putting this prototype system

252
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,560
together in the meantime

253
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,519
we had begun developing a set of

254
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,120
protocols for

255
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,920
this interplanetary backbone now some

256
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,480
people

257
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,440
who might reasonably have assumed that

258
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
we could use the tcpip protocols after

259
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,920
all they worked okay on earth

260
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,800
they surely would work okay on mars but

261
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,080
when we started doing

262
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,480
the math we realized that the round trip

263
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
times between earth and mars are

264
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,680
variable

265
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
ranging from seven minutes round trip to

266
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
40 minutes round trip

267
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,320
and uh those of you who are familiar

268
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,200
with tcp

269
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,519
will know that the uh flow control

270
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,040
mechanisms are pretty simple

271
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,399
basically when you think you're going to

272
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,080
run out of room you tell the other guy

273
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,120
stop

274
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
and of course if it takes 20 minutes for

275
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
the other guy to hear you say stop

276
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,959
while he while he's not hearing you say

277
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,080
stop he's transmitting

278
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,560
full bore until you've got traffic

279
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,399
falling on the floor and blowing away in

280
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,519
the wind

281
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,680
so uh oh and we had another little

282
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,040
problem too and that was

283
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,360
uh the planets are rotating and we

284
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
didn't know how to stop that either

285
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
and so that meant if you were talking to

286
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
something on the surface

287
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,640
and the planet rotated uh you'd lose

288
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
contact until the planet rotated back

289
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,360
around again

290
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,000
and so we had a variably delay because

291
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
of the orbital considerations

292
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,560
and disrupted environment to deal with

293
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,440
and tcp

294
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,200
as wonderful as it has been has

295
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,360
doesn't do well with those kinds of

296
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,760
variable and high delays and

297
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,800
frequent disruptions so um oh

298
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,320
and we had another scenario that was

299
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
also a little disturbing imagine for

300
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
a moment that you're on mars and you're

301
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,519
trying to communicate with something on

302
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,480
earth

303
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,880
so you're going to do a dns lookup well

304
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,640
okay first of all you don't know how

305
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
long it's going to take to get an answer

306
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,040
back

307
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,800
and if the packet gets lost and you have

308
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
to re-transmit it could be really bad

309
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,120
like an hour or more

310
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,880
then the other problem is that because

311
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200
there's an increasing amount of mobility

312
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,680
on in the internet environment imagine

313
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,959
that you did a lookup

314
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,120
you got an ip address and by the time

315
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
you got it it was too late because the

316
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,800
device you wanted to talk to is moved

317
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,079
into a different network with a

318
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,600
different ip address

319
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,240
so dns lookup in these circumstances

320
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
didn't look too attractive

321
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,480
either and so we decided okay rather

322
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:14,880
than

323
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,440
trying to you know contort the tcp

324
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
protocols and the other

325
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,519
protocols that go with it we said let's

326
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,240
just look

327
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,360
at the design of a network that operates

328
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,200
in a delay and disruption tolerant

329
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,399
environment

330
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,000
and so we develop what's called the

331
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,160
bundled protocol again it's like the

332
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,600
internet space it's a layered

333
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
architecture

334
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
first thing we did was with regard to

335
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
name resolution was to have a two-step

336
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
resolution the first one is which planet

337
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,680
are you going to

338
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
you know how do i get to that planet and

339
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
after i get a packet to land on the

340
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,640
right planet

341
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,399
or the right spacecraft if it's in

342
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,399
transit somewhere

343
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,959
then then i do a second lookup to find

344
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,200
out where is it that i'm actually going

345
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,519
on that planetary network so we have a

346
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,560
two-stage

347
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
name resolution mechanism the second

348
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,639
thing that's interesting is that because

349
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,120
of the potential for disruption

350
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,440
we decided that the relay nodes in the

351
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
system should actually be able to hold

352
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,880
on to data

353
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
until a link comes back up again you

354
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,920
know based on

355
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,720
the orbital dynamics that might be

356
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,079
involved that's different from the

357
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,000
internet where we decided if there was

358
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,560
no forwarding link you throw things away

359
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,959
that's because in the design phase back

360
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,720
40 years ago or more now

361
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,360
getting close to 50 years storing things

362
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,959
in the net didn't look very

363
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,440
feasible because memory was expensive

364
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
now 50 years later

365
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,959
you can put a lot more memory in the net

366
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,800
and so we decided to take advantage of

367
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,440
that and allow the net to hold data

368
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
so that links could come and go and the

369
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,760
system would hold on to it until links

370
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
come back up again

371
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,000
so uh so that's a different uh

372
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,839
architectural choice

373
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,240
uh then we started looking at how you

374
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,320
manage a network like this

375
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
and you know for many of us who grew up

376
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
with the internet uh ping was our friend

377
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
right you sent a ping and he got back

378
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
something in 500 milliseconds or

379
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,079
less and you had some idea are you up

380
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,600
there and are you functioning

381
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,519
well pain is not your friend in a high

382
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,760
very highly variable delay environment

383
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,040
for one thing you don't know how long

384
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,480
it's going to take to come back what if

385
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,000
it gets lost what if it has to be

386
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
retransmitted

387
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,680
so it's not a real-time kind of

388
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
mechanism at all

389
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,720
so we had to build in a much more

390
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
elaborate network management system

391
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,639
which recognizes that

392
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,000
there isn't going to be a lot of

393
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,560
interaction between some network

394
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,160
management tool

395
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,240
and the system that that you're trying

396
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,959
to manage or whose data you're trying to

397
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,079
state you're trying to collect so we had

398
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:44,800
to develop

399
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,199
a new network management system that

400
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,560
dealt with that

401
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,000
uh we also noticed that in the internet

402
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,639
environment

403
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,320
certainly in the early days we didn't

404
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,240
have a whole lot of cryptography

405
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,639
and protecting of information or strong

406
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,600
authentication with digital signatures

407
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,079
and uh the last thing that i wanted when

408
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,920
we were starting this project was the

409
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
headline that says 15 year old takes

410
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,839
over mars net

411
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,560
so we concluded that we should design

412
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,680
authentication

413
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,399
and cryptography into the system as a

414
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,560
fundamental part of the design

415
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,720
and so bundles can be encrypted they can

416
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
be digitally signed the devices that are

417
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,399
part of the network can authenticate

418
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,440
each other

419
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
using digital signatures again there's

420
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
all kinds of registration mechanisms in

421
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,880
order to make that work

422
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,800
so here's where we where we are now or

423
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,079
how we got where we are in 2004 i've

424
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,000
already told you the story about

425
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,959
putting in this store and forward system

426
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,000
in order to recover

427
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,040
data back from the mars rovers 99

428
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,279
of all the data that has come back from

429
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,639
all of the

430
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,360
spacecraft that the u.s has sent from

431
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,320
mars has used the orbiters as relays

432
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
storm forward relays to gather all of

433
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,680
the data

434
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,120
um and this is just a nicer picture of

435
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
some of the various spacecraft that have

436
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,639
landed in addition to spirit and

437
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,560
opportunity there was the mars science

438
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,079
lander there was the

439
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,079
one got the mars science laboratory came

440
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,199
after the two

441
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
spirit and opportunity rovers uh the

442
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,079
phoenix lander arrived at the north pole

443
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,560
and more recently of course perseverance

444
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,680
just arrived

445
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,600
successfully and even just flew

446
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,040
ingenuity

447
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
about 10 feet off the ground which is so

448
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,560
amazing because

449
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,720
there isn't a lot of atmosphere for a

450
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
helicopter to work

451
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
all of those vehicles have been using

452
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
the storm forward techniques

453
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,839
that we developed for spirit and

454
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,279
opportunity so we've been testing these

455
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,000
protocols and evolving them over time

456
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,920
to improve their robustness and their

457
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,079
utility uh we actually

458
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,560
got permission to use a satellite that

459
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,680
was

460
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,480
called the deep impact spacecraft uh

461
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
that was used in the epoxy mission for

462
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,720
you know to visit two uh two comments

463
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,839
they gathered they gave

464
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,959
us uh permission to upload our software

465
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,120
into this spacecraft and then test it at

466
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,839
about eighty eighty one light seconds

467
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,000
away

468
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,079
then we've been testing on the

469
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,160
international space station actually now

470
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,399
well beyond 2018

471
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,759
we did a metaron test in order to find

472
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,320
out whether

473
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,639
these protocols that were designed for

474
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,079
highly variable delay

475
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,800
and disruption would work in real time

476
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,680
if in fact

477
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,399
the distances were short and so the

478
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,000
mederon experiment was

479
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
on board the international space station

480
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,079
the astronauts could control a small

481
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,360
rover

482
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,680
in germany and and literally steer it

483
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
around with the joystick so to speak

484
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,320
uh using the same protocols but in real

485
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,519
time because the

486
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,639
physical delays were so short we also

487
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,120
did a high speed experiment using

488
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,399
lasers bouncing a signal off of the moon

489
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,880
coming back to earth and then running

490
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,279
the protocols on top of that

491
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,360
laser-based signal we were able to get

492
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,440
600 megabits a second so the important

493
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,120
point i want to make here is that the

494
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
protocols

495
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,679
functionally span over quite a wide

496
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,640
range of

497
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,919
latency disruption and speeds

498
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,880
and so it has a broader footprint

499
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,160
functional footprint

500
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,599
than tcp uh we have been

501
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,880
uh doing a lot of work now with other

502
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,760
uh of the space fairing nations uh in

503
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,119
japan at jaxa

504
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,080
cary and in korea we've been working

505
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
with esa with which

506
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
with whom we did the metronome

507
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,799
experiment for example

508
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,840
we've also set up a

509
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,799
dtm working group in the ietf which has

510
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,240
been standardizing the

511
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
bundle protocols version 6 and now

512
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,120
version 7 which we think is a stable

513
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
version that we're going to use we've

514
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,480
also worked

515
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,919
this team has worked with the

516
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,600
consultative committee on space data

517
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,480
systems

518
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,520
which is an agency of the um where all

519
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
the space firing nations get together to

520
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,200
standardize communication

521
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
protocols for space comms and

522
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,080
we've standardized the bundle protocol

523
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,559
through ccsds as well so we've operated

524
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,960
in parallel with the dtm working group

525
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
uh in the ietf now there's another

526
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,440
exciting application

527
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,039
uh was undertaken in by lulia university

528
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,280
which is about 60 degrees north

529
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,559
in sweden uh the the group there

530
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,720
is using the bundle protocols in order

531
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,640
to track reindeer who are wandering

532
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,520
around

533
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,120
uh in the uh with the sami reindeer

534
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,840
herders and the idea there is to use

535
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,320
this variable connectivity

536
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,720
and opportunistic grounding in order to

537
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,559
track the uh the reindeer

538
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,679
as they wander around uh in their uh you

539
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,080
know

540
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,320
wherever it is that they're going to go

541
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,120
so uh

542
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,360
this has been something an unusual way

543
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,039
of uh testing the

544
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,000
robustness of the protocols there also

545
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,840
are implementations

546
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,000
of this protocol for android for example

547
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,360
or for some other small

548
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,320
small programmable devices ubiquity is

549
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,919
another example

550
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,840
um i've already mentioned that we're

551
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
working together with the other space

552
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
fairing nations on standardizing and

553
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,960
using these protocols

554
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
protocols have been implemented in uh

555
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,120
reference form and they're available

556
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
several of them from github one of which

557
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,160
is the

558
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,120
ion implementation that nasa is using

559
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,440
for

560
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,520
most of its work but there are several

561
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,840
other implementations as well

562
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,039
and in the future what we're planning uh

563
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,400
is to make available these

564
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,240
applications that run on top of the

565
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
bundle protocols

566
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,240
first of all making use of those

567
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,720
capabilities for the return to the moon

568
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,120
the artemis program that the u.s is

569
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,919
mounted uh

570
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,440
and the gateway program which is an

571
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,600
international effort to put a spacecraft

572
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,240
in

573
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,559
an eccentric orbit to sort of act as an

574
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,720
elevator to go from earth to mars or

575
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,600
earth to the moon and back uh bringing

576
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,159
space

577
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,360
uh bringing the astronauts uh

578
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,919
to orbit near the moon where they can go

579
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,400
down

580
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,960
uh to a ground station and stay there

581
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,039
for a while in a laboratory environment

582
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,120
and then return

583
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,960
there is an organization called the

584
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
interplanetary network special interest

585
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,840
group that was formed way back in 1998

586
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
uh under the auspices of the internet

587
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,200
society

588
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,240
and that group uh is bringing

589
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,840
the interplanetary protocols on into

590
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,080
terrestrial

591
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,120
uh applications and it's pursuing four

592
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,159
or five different

593
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,919
paths one of them uh is to

594
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,400
put these protocols into the cloud-based

595
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,600
systems from

596
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,520
you know azure and aws and google

597
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
so we have the protocols now running in

598
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,480
those various clouds our intent

599
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,880
is to invite people to build

600
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,200
applications for mobiles for example or

601
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
for laptops or desktops or

602
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,400
tablets and things like that so they can

603
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,919
exercise

604
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,080
the interplanetary protocols with some

605
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,840
simple applications maybe

606
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,480
image lookup for identification in the

607
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,520
database

608
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,559
but the idea there is to ask the general

609
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,559
public to help us

610
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,640
generate a substantial amount of traffic

611
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,000
to go through the

612
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,919
interplanetary protocol system so that

613
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,919
we can shake out

614
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,320
its determine its robustness fix

615
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,559
problems along those lines

616
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,240
we're also very interested in making

617
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,520
sure that all the various

618
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,600
implementations of the bundle protocols

619
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,960
will interwork

620
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,880
some of you will remember the interop

621
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
company that was started by dan lynch

622
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,360
back about 1986

623
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,760
it had the uh the feature that if you

624
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,960
wanted to exhibit

625
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,679
at the interop show you had to agree to

626
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,600
hook up to the show net which is a big

627
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,320
yellow

628
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
ethernet cable system and then

629
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
demonstrate your interoperability with

630
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,919
the other people who are on the show

631
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,360
we're thinking that we should

632
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,320
uh perhaps resurrect that idea so the

633
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,760
people who are implementing different

634
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,120
versions of the

635
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,640
bundle protocols can demonstrate their

636
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,120
interoperability

637
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,760
we also have a kind of a dtn bone

638
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,360
arrangement using all of the laboratory

639
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,080
facilities at nasa plus some of the labs

640
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
that are associated with others

641
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,480
of the other space faring space agencies

642
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
where we can do further testing and

643
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
development of the

644
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,240
different applications intended for real

645
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,600
use in

646
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,840
space applications here what we're

647
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,360
trying to do is to

648
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,720
increase the technology called trl

649
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
level uh technology readiness level of

650
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,240
the protocol

651
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,159
so that they can be prepared for

652
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,440
authorization for use in flight

653
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,559
so the ipn cities also looking

654
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,440
100 years out looking at what would it

655
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,559
look like

656
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,880
say 30 years from now and 100 years from

657
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,679
now

658
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,720
as we see the commercialization of space

659
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,400
the possibility that some of the

660
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
communication systems will move

661
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,960
from the responsibility of the

662
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,039
space organizations like nasa and esa

663
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,320
and jaxa

664
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,559
to commercial enterprise in the same way

665
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,559
that the internet went from

666
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,480
government-sponsored backbones like

667
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
nsfnet and the arpanet and

668
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,760
es net and nasa science internet among

669
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,640
others

670
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,000
to commercial use we're anticipating

671
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,320
that there will be a transition period

672
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,200
over the course of the 30 to 100 years

673
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,679
where

674
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,000
a lot of the network operations will be

675
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
commercial in nature

676
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,799
and still have government networks that

677
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,279
will interact with the system

678
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,679
so we're looking forward as far as we

679
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,559
can

680
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,200
towards the true growth of an

681
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,880
interplanetary backbone

682
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,720
we're not suggesting that you should

683
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,960
just run off and go build something and

684
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,640
hope somebody will use it

685
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,880
in fact what we're guessing is that most

686
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,559
of the spacecraft that will use this

687
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,400
interplanetary system

688
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,360
uh will eventually when they finish

689
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,279
their scientific experiments

690
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,440
those spacecraft could be repurposed as

691
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
nodes of the interplanetary backbone so

692
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,279
you can imagine this sort of going over

693
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,200
a period of decades

694
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,360
mission by mission spacecraft by

695
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,440
spacecraft until we have

696
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,760
nodes that are prepared to cover a

697
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,200
substantial portion

698
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
of the solar system's communication

699
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
requirements

700
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,120
i think i may have one more slide yes

701
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,480
that's this one this is just to

702
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,200
illustrate

703
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,760
how things might look 100 years from now

704
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,600
when we have a rich communications

705
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,360
environment

706
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,360
uh and uh and that it will be simply the

707
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,000
norm to

708
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,679
assume that the solar system internet is

709
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,240
in place

710
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,720
and there to support uh any either

711
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,600
commercial

712
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,679
or scientific missions i think i may

713
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,240
have one more slide yes here we go

714
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,840
uh now some of us after our enthusiasm

715
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,320
uh for the solar system internet uh

716
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,440
blossomed

717
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,080
said well what should we be doing now to

718
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,840
be ready a hundred years from now

719
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,880
for uh the possibility of a mission uh

720
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,159
to the nearest star and so the nearest

721
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,000
star is alpha centauri as all of you

722
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,880
know

723
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,520
uh and we began doing some uh

724
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
computations to figure out what it would

725
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,200
actually take

726
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,520
to deliver a spacecraft in 100 years

727
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,400
time

728
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,919
frankly right now with the current

729
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,159
propulsion systems it would take

730
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,600
76 000 years to get there which is a

731
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,799
little long

732
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,640
and so 100 years would require

733
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,080
substantial

734
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,840
new rocket engine capability probably

735
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,840
something that would use ion engines for

736
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,360
example with a very

737
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,200
specifically high specific impulse

738
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,520
but i thought i should take this problem

739
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,279
to people who are accustomed to doing

740
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,279
really hard computations so i took it to

741
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:57,760
the

742
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,880
lincoln laboratory at mit and i said

743
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,919
how far away are we

744
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,240
technically from being able to get a

745
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
spacecraft to

746
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,400
alpha centauri and have it collect data

747
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,039
and transmit data back to earth

748
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,120
well after they did the analysis the

749
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,279
answer is i'm 53 db

750
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,600
away from being able to do that and i

751
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,799
have a huge

752
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,600
you know a mountain to climb in order to

753
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
overcome some of the barriers

754
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,279
let me just give you one example of how

755
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,120
tricky this is going to be

756
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,520
imagine that you're at alpha centauri

757
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
you have a spacecraft that's collected

758
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,760
data you want to transmit data back to

759
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
earth

760
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,000
you have to point this thing at where

761
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,520
the earth is going to be

762
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,960
4.3 years from now and you have to aim

763
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,279
it

764
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,720
and remember that even if it's a

765
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,400
collimated laser it's going to beam

766
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
spread so you have to aim it

767
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
so that it'll hit some part of planet

768
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,840
earth or at least it's

769
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,279
some spacecraft whose orbit you can

770
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,159
calculate

771
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,279
to pick up that signal and so this is a

772
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,000
non-trivial exercise and we won't get to

773
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,080
do this probably for a while

774
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,720
but it's something to anticipate for the

775
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,600
future

776
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,720
so that's the up to the minute uh report

777
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,279
to you on the interplanetary backbone

778
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,200
uh i'm really looking forward to being

779
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,039
able to report to you what happens when

780
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,720
we start engaging with the general

781
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,679
public and i hope

782
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,799
some of you and perhaps some of you will

783
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,120
get

784
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,720
interested enough in this to join the

785
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,640
interplanetary network special interest

786
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,039
group just go to ipmc.org

787
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,120
to see more about that and now i think

788
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
we've got some time to chat

789
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,200
uh i'll try to answer any questions you

790
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,440
have

791
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,559
thank you vin that was wonderful we have

792
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,679
approx

793
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,120
we have approximately 28 minutes

794
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,240
to field some questions and we have

795
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,559
five right now i'm going to read them to

796
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,360
you

797
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,840
okay could you could you please explain

798
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,240
why 28 kbps

799
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,840
made people grumpy uh well it may people

800
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,240
grumpy because 28 kilobits a second is

801
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,600
not very

802
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,919
uh high data rate and considering the

803
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,720
increasing

804
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,440
amount of content that the rovers are

805
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
capable of generating because of the

806
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,399
analytics and

807
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,080
all of the imagery units there is

808
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,600
significant number of cameras for

809
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,559
example

810
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,039
on board perseverance as as there were

811
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,399
on the other brokers

812
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,240
so 28 kilobits isn't very much uh the

813
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,440
excitement right now is optical um

814
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,919
and there i think i mentioned in my talk

815
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,640
that uh

816
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,799
we've at least done one example of an

817
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,120
optical length and moon and back at 6.2

818
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
megabits a second

819
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,320
of course the data rates tend to fall

820
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
off as you go farther and farther away

821
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:42,960
because the signal

822
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,440
noise ratio gets smaller and less you

823
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
can get the antenna to be bigger

824
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,480
for the power signals to be higher

825
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,960
so um something that is moral on the

826
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,760
lines of

827
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,080
megabit per second would be extremely

828
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,279
welcome

829
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,159
for this kind of exploration and then

830
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:00,799
that's why

831
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,279
the scientists were grumpy about 28 they

832
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,279
were happier with 128

833
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,799
to be honest i'm so sorry uh i

834
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,480
am down in my basement and

835
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,440
there these are political calls that

836
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
come and normally i

837
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,320
can't i can't these are people asking

838
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,600
for uh

839
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,158
for money

840
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,200
to copy

841
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,120
uh i hope everybody gets an amuse and

842
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,480
some amusement out of that

843
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,559
uh it usually works except for the time

844
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,399
when the fbi called

845
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,159
and then i had trouble explaining what

846
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,760
was this uh russian and that

847
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,039
varish business all about okay so that's

848
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,080
my basic answer

849
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
28 kilobits is too slow can you do

850
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,640
something faster for me and we did

851
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,559
we'd like it to be even faster than that

852
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,880
and optical is the direction to go to

853
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,679
achieve that objective

854
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,640
excellent that first question was posted

855
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,960
into our pc tool and i was just copied

856
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,480
over i do not know who

857
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,559
uh sent it but our next question comes

858
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,399
from jordan

859
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,559
santio he uh he or she asks i wonder why

860
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,120
the round-trip times from earth to mars

861
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,600
is very jittery between seven or forty

862
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,720
minutes

863
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
question oh it's not it's not jittery at

864
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,080
all uh it it's

865
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,720
it's simply a a consequence of uh

866
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,840
orbital

867
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,080
uh motions of both earth and mars keep

868
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,679
in mind they're in the

869
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,559
ellipsoidal nearly circular orbits

870
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,039
around

871
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,360
the sun but since they're not moving at

872
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,440
the same speed earth is going around

873
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,279
in essentially 365 days and

874
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,600
mars is going around in more like 620

875
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,720
some odd days

876
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,520
and so uh it lags the earth and so our

877
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,600
distance increases over time and then it

878
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,240
decreases after it reaches a maximum

879
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,960
so the nearest approaches are about 35

880
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,159
million miles

881
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,120
the most distant approaches uh are about

882
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,080
235 million miles and

883
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,480
hence the seven and a half minute round

884
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
trip time when we're closest together

885
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,200
and the 20 40 minute round trip time

886
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,559
when we're farthest apart

887
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,840
so it's a continuously varying uh value

888
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,159
for

889
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,960
round trip time uh it's not jittery in

890
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,320
the sense of jumping back and forth

891
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,519
okay jordan also asks

892
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,720
i wonder if ipv4 or ipv6

893
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,440
being used at all for the ccsds

894
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,080
file delivery protocol and if they are

895
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,440
used which one is better

896
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,159
ipv4 or ipv6 well pog ev4 and ipv6 are

897
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,320
functionally equivalent the only

898
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,279
essential difference is that v6 has a

899
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,399
larger address space

900
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,039
either one potentially could be used in

901
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,960
low latency environments

902
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,840
in high latency environments it's

903
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,200
not satisfactory to run straight ip you

904
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,960
have to do something on top of that

905
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,440
tcp would be insufficient because of the

906
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,640
the round trip time variation

907
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,399
means that the flow control would not

908
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,000
work very well it's a very simple flow

909
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,760
control for tcp

910
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
so you'd have to run something else

911
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
that's delay and disruption tolerance

912
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,120
over ip and in fact because

913
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,399
we don't want to apply an ip address

914
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,640
space structure across the entire solar

915
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,000
system

916
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,360
owing to the fact that the

917
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,279
consumption of ip address space will

918
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,640
vary significantly from planet to planet

919
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,720
i'm making it sound as if the planets

920
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,559
are populated they're not but they would

921
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,080
have and do have

922
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,480
spacecraft that we need to communicate

923
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,080
with they will need some kind of

924
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,679
addressing capability

925
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,799
but earth is consuming address space at

926
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,039
an enormous rate partly in consequence

927
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,640
of mobile telephony and

928
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,279
internet of things and so uh we

929
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,480
concluded

930
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
that we needed a different addressing

931
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,200
structure for the interplanetary system

932
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,000
and so endpoint identifiers in the

933
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,159
bundle protocol suite

934
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,440
are not either ipv4 or ipv6

935
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,919
the bundle protocol suite could run over

936
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,440
ip

937
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,519
and could run over ipv6 in low latency

938
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,559
settings um because we don't expect to

939
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:26,960
use

940
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,320
ipv4 or ipv6 for the high

941
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,600
latency interplanetary environment we

942
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,159
use the

943
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,519
bundle protocol and the uh the glider

944
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,080
trend

945
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,320
transmission protocols for that the

946
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,519
other point i would make about

947
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,320
addressing

948
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,600
is that um and i think i made this point

949
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,559
earlier

950
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,840
uh if you're going into a multi-hop

951
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,039
interplanetary environment the

952
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,200
last thing in the world you want to do

953
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,919
is from the origin point try to resolve

954
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,240
the destination address on the target

955
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,519
planet

956
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,120
which is what the tcp protocols would do

957
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,119
in order to address the packet over ip

958
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,079
and if you so remember i mentioned this

959
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,000
that if you do a lookup from

960
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,639
mars for example to get an ip address on

961
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,399
earth

962
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,320
you might not get an answer back for

963
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,918
perhaps as much as 40 minutes

964
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,000
maybe even more if a retransmission is

965
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,960
required

966
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,719
by the time you get the answer back it's

967
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,399
possible that the ip address

968
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,320
actually of the target will have changed

969
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,760
on earth because the target might be

970
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,040
mobile

971
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,879
so we concluded that the right thing to

972
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,480
do is have an endpoint addressing

973
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,040
structure which has two parts to it

974
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,359
one of them is uh which planet are you

975
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,119
going to or which spacecraft are you

976
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:43,839
going to

977
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,239
and then where uh which device on that

978
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,520
planet or which device on that

979
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,560
spacecraft

980
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,879
are you addressing so it's a two apart

981
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,960
adjusting structure and it's only the

982
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,800
when you get to the target planet or

983
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,720
spacecraft did you do the final lookup

984
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,440
to see

985
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,480
what identifier to use on that target

986
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,680
so neither ipv4 nor ipv6 would be

987
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,079
appropriate for an end to end

988
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,280
transmission except in a low latency

989
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,839
environment

990
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,359
okay moving right along um this came

991
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,119
from our pc tool as well

992
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,839
uh this is kind of a previous question

993
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,320
are we

994
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,720
are we going to have enough ipv6

995
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,520
addresses

996
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,720
for an interplanetary network well the

997
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,880
implications of my previous answer are

998
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,359
the

999
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,400
no uh and so we aren't trying to use

1000
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,800
ipv6 to address the entire

1001
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,560
solar system we were thinking you know

1002
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,079
100 years ahead

1003
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,320
that there would be at most modest

1004
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,280
populations

1005
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,880
on uh the moon and mars uh possibly only

1006
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,920
scientific things

1007
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,200
um maybe if elon musk's

1008
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,280
hopes are uh are fulfilled maybe we

1009
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,240
might actually have

1010
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,280
some colonization on mars uh if not

1011
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,800
also on the moon of course the

1012
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,320
conditions and both

1013
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,880
places are quite extreme uh and so i

1014
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
wouldn't expect the population explosion

1015
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,240
necessarily

1016
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,119
um however we we just were thinking in

1017
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,000
general

1018
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,119
that um that the consumption rate

1019
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,240
of ip address phase uh on earth would

1020
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,960
continue

1021
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,000
uh undiminished and so

1022
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,520
having to share the address space with

1023
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,200
the rest of the finances seemed like in

1024
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,160
the state

1025
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,560
uh in addition to which the two two-part

1026
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,000
addressing structure would not be

1027
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,720
accounted for

1028
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,680
in the case of uh ipv4 or ipv6

1029
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,640
so uh we would allow technically each of

1030
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,880
the planets to have their own v4 or

1031
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,160
in or v6 address space completely

1032
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,680
separate from and not reachable directly

1033
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,440
from any of the other planets or any of

1034
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,960
the other spacecraft

1035
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,920
uh it gets tricky when you imagine a

1036
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,760
spacecraft going from earth to mars

1037
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,880
let's say

1038
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,839
while you're in on earth physically or

1039
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,400
maybe an

1040
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,480
ortho orbit you could be using the dress

1041
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,000
spaces that are

1042
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,200
specific to earth as you're in transit

1043
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,599
uh and not either near earth or near

1044
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,480
mars you need

1045
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,920
another endpoint addressing uh mechanism

1046
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,839
and then when you get to mars you need

1047
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:14,960
the third one

1048
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,640
uh so we concluded that we had to have

1049
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
endpoint addressing that takes those

1050
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
scenarios into account

1051
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,240
and so we could distinguish between a

1052
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,520
thing on earth

1053
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,880
a thing that's in solar system space

1054
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,960
but not associated with any planet or

1055
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,079
moon or anything

1056
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,800
and then a device that's local to one of

1057
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,240
the planets or one of the moons in the

1058
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,359
solar system

1059
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,280
so the endpoint identifier structure of

1060
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,880
the bundle protocol suite takes that

1061
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,079
into account

1062
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,800
which ipv4 or ipv6 would not

1063
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,440
excellent this last question also came

1064
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,119
from our pc tool

1065
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,720
what skills do you think a network

1066
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,800
engineer will need to operate

1067
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,680
an interplanetary network this is a

1068
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,520
really really good question so thank you

1069
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,720
for asking that

1070
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,640
the first thing that you have to do is

1071
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,079
to let go of all of your

1072
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,440
intuition about uh networks being uh

1073
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,520
responsive in this in the sense of pain

1074
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
being something that gives you

1075
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,160
uh an immediate sense of whether the

1076
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,400
target is alive and well or

1077
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,680
whether the smtp network management

1078
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,440
system is functioning

1079
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,119
or whether you could have fairly

1080
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,480
interactive exchanges

1081
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,200
between network management system and a

1082
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,160
particular device that's being managed

1083
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,440
the smtp designs uh and even the

1084
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,599
proprietary designs tend to take into

1085
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,480
account

1086
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,680
uh a notion of easy interaction

1087
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,800
uh short low latency interactions to

1088
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,920
set variables and to gather data or send

1089
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,119
commands

1090
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,000
the situation in the interplanetary

1091
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,720
environment

1092
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,200
is that the delays are sufficiently high

1093
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,880
and the delivery is sufficiently

1094
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
uncertain

1095
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,119
that you need a different kind of

1096
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,960
network management system which is delay

1097
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,640
and disruption tolerance

1098
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,400
the implication of that is that you're

1099
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,119
typically going to be sending a chunk of

1100
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,240
commands

1101
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
to the target which the command which

1102
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,400
the target would then execute

1103
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,760
autonomously and then respond uh

1104
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,680
at its convenience um so we have a much

1105
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,320
less interactive kind of design

1106
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,079
than a typical uh earth-based

1107
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,440
uh internet uh management systems

1108
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,079
uh so again ping is not your friend and

1109
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,520
the network management system

1110
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,200
has to be uh properly configured and

1111
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,040
designed for

1112
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,359
a high latency and potentially glossy

1113
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,880
environment

1114
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
and so we've developed a whole new suite

1115
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,720
of network management protocols

1116
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,440
that follow those characteristics and

1117
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,079
which we

1118
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,160
hope will uh serve uh the need

1119
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,400
we'll that we'll be experimenting with

1120
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,760
it testing it

1121
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,480
first in uh on earth and in near-earth

1122
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:00,800
uh

1123
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,440
environments including the moon uh and

1124
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,319
then of course

1125
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,480
as the missions are launched to mars

1126
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,440
we'll be

1127
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,640
uh validating those those designs

1128
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,040
uh with those systems and hopefully uh

1129
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,880
with other missions that are

1130
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,920
anticipated between now and say 2030

1131
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,000
we'll be able to evaluate how well the

1132
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,920
network management system functions in a

1133
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,640
relatively dispersed high latency

1134
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,880
environment thank you again

1135
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,560
this next question comes from matthew

1136
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,400
pitock he asks

1137
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,440
how does the interplanetary network deal

1138
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,920
with time

1139
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,720
synchronization and what standard time

1140
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,520
reference

1141
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,640
gets used when greenwich time no longer

1142
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,800
has local relevance

1143
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,119
so well greenwich time is probably i

1144
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,480
know you're thinking utc

1145
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,000
universal time uh that it is

1146
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,920
uh actually there's nothing wrong with

1147
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,000
utc and there's nothing wrong with

1148
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,599
trying to maintain a standard that's

1149
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,440
based on utc

1150
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,480
um it's simply um a a

1151
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,240
synchronizing uh mechanism the

1152
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,480
it is correct however the time sync is

1153
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,000
very important because the

1154
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,839
various spacecraft have to know when

1155
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,839
they should be transmitting

1156
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,560
and so we would we can use things like

1157
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:16,880
the

1158
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,440
network time protocol or other others

1159
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,640
that are similar

1160
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,599
for purposes of doing time sync we would

1161
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,040
expect to use

1162
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,000
fairly high resolution clocks some of

1163
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,520
you may know that

1164
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,079
that nist the national institutes of

1165
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,520
standards and technology has been

1166
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,560
developing

1167
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,280
what in effect is a clock on a chip

1168
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
instead of having you know a giant

1169
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,240
atomic clock so we're reaching the point

1170
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,599
where we can do

1171
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,920
uh these kinds of protocols in spite of

1172
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,440
the fact that

1173
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,079
the latencies may be very high you can

1174
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:50,880
still

1175
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,920
achieve einsteinian synchronization

1176
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,200
uh with these systems um so so that's

1177
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,599
the

1178
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,480
uh the plan is that we would have

1179
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
relatively high resolution clocks in the

1180
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,599
spacecraft and

1181
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,160
on the surface of the planets we do that

1182
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,800
today

1183
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,960
as you must know uh for all of the

1184
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,640
spacecraft that are

1185
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,800
in flight and are on the surface of the

1186
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,160
planets they have

1187
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,480
clock resolutions that are sufficient to

1188
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,079
allow them to know when they should be

1189
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,000
receiving or when they should expect to

1190
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,280
transmit

1191
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,520
the contact graph system which is used

1192
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,359
for routing and timing

1193
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,480
uh has indications as to when

1194
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,920
uh a an antenna needs to be pointed in

1195
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,839
some particular direction and needs to

1196
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,760
be either prepared to receive or prepare

1197
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,480
to

1198
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,760
transmit um so um

1199
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,839
the distances that are involved at least

1200
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,079
within the solar system

1201
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,880
are not so high that we can't maintain

1202
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,720
clock sync

1203
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,680
when it comes to even larger distances

1204
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
i'm less clear about that

1205
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,119
and i would guess that we would need

1206
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,200
high resolution clocks that

1207
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,240
that we can rely on

1208
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,200
thank you our next question is from

1209
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,960
keldi adoni

1210
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,240
lds does it make sense to switch earth

1211
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,839
satellite orbiter rover instead of

1212
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,359
in and out of earth station would it

1213
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,400
provide better signal levels by avoiding

1214
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,280
the attenuation of the atmosphere so

1215
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,640
that's a very good question

1216
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,720
one of the reasons that we still use the

1217
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,920
deep space network

1218
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,119
is that we can build 70 meter dishes

1219
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,319
which are honking big antennas they have

1220
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,160
very high gain

1221
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,760
when we go outside of the atmosphere

1222
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,920
now we're talking about either putting

1223
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,200
something for example

1224
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,440
on the far side of the moon or putting

1225
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,319
something in orbit around earth

1226
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,400
which by the way has served us well in

1227
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,560
the mars case the orbiters

1228
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,480
on mars uh have more solar power

1229
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,119
and bigger antennas than the things that

1230
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,280
we were able to land on the surface

1231
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,280
and so transmitting through the orbiting

1232
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,200
relay

1233
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,000
turned out to benefit us we could make a

1234
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,680
similar argument i suspect

1235
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,760
for um for collecting signals and

1236
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,040
sending signals to

1237
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,200
mars by using earth orbiting

1238
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,040
communications relays as opposed to

1239
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,960
going all the way back to the deep space

1240
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,680
now

1241
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,079
i will say however that the deep space

1242
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:26,960
net

1243
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,160
because of the antenna game is an

1244
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,760
extremely attractive proposition

1245
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,599
compared with the size of the antennas

1246
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,000
that we could manage the field

1247
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,880
in orbit around the earth now having

1248
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,079
said that

1249
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,640
you know that the james webb telescope

1250
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,680
is a honking big telescope

1251
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,760
with a great deal it means physically a

1252
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,720
very large

1253
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,200
piece of equipment so your suggestion is

1254
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,119
not totally

1255
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,160
out of line but we would we would need

1256
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,480
a significant size antenna in orbit

1257
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,079
in order to achieve the same kinds of

1258
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,000
uh gain despite atmospheric

1259
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,440
uh limitations uh with the

1260
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,280
deep space network now when we go to

1261
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,040
optical

1262
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,359
uh that's a different story and it's

1263
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,079
very much

1264
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,400
uh likely that we would want to have an

1265
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,760
orbiting satellite

1266
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,720
telescope uh which could receive an

1267
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,079
optical signal

1268
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,160
uh and avoid attenuation through the

1269
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,599
atmosphere

1270
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,000
so the suggestion is not at all crazy it

1271
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,240
actually probably should be part of our

1272
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,040
long-term plan

1273
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,680
excellent thank you our next question

1274
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,920
comes from jeff barteg

1275
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,119
tcp ip and many other protocols built

1276
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,800
on top of it that make

1277
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,680
the internet work are simple and elegant

1278
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,520
sometimes having

1279
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,720
designs that have that can be created

1280
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,040
with a pen and napkin it sounds like

1281
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,520
these interplanetary protocols

1282
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,000
are more complex and complete if the

1283
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
original internet protocols

1284
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,240
were comparably in complexity

1285
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,640
how would that have impacted adoption

1286
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,480
and will this complexity impact adoption

1287
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,359
for interplanetary adoption

1288
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,440
well thank you you're quite right that

1289
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,359
simplicity has been our friend

1290
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,880
when it comes to the tcp protocol suites

1291
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,119
especially at the ip layer the tcp

1292
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,960
implementations of course have evolved

1293
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,800
over time with all kinds of mechanisms

1294
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,800
for flow control and buffer block

1295
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,359
management and things of that kind the

1296
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,440
bundle protocol suite is not terribly

1297
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,319
different

1298
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,079
the bundle protocol itself is closer to

1299
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,520
ip the internet protocol

1300
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,960
in terms of the basic simplicity

1301
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,680
uh however as as i pointed out in my

1302
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,400
talk

1303
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,480
we made one choice that's quite

1304
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,920
different from the ip

1305
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,760
case and that's where we actually store

1306
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,160
content in the network

1307
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
in order to avoid throwing things away

1308
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,920
that we worked really hard to

1309
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,920
deliver part way to the destination

1310
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,960
um i our implementations of the

1311
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,800
bundle protocol have not been

1312
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,000
overwhelmingly

1313
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,079
more complex than the implementations of

1314
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,119
the tcp

1315
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,720
suite they may seem that way

1316
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,720
because we've incorporated the security

1317
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,119
mechanisms into the bundle protocol

1318
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,000
as opposed to layering them on top as we

1319
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,160
did with tls uh

1320
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,079
some of you will know that the quick

1321
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,720
protocol is an alternative to tcpip

1322
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,599
which combines

1323
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,520
the tcp functions with the end-to-end

1324
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,559
crypto functions the tls functions

1325
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,000
and also introduces some um important

1326
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,040
multi-channel flow control within a

1327
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,240
quick connection so um

1328
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,040
i'm not worried that the level of

1329
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,920
complexity

1330
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,559
of the bundle protocols is significantly

1331
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,520
different

1332
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,800
than the tcpip or the udp-10ip

1333
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,640
combinations have been

1334
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,800
uh and the evidence of that of course is

1335
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,480
that we have multiple implementations of

1336
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,480
the bundle protocol that are shown to

1337
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,440
work

1338
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,960
and once you get to the point where

1339
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,960
you're working is reliable

1340
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,040
um you can convince yourself that it

1341
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,960
must not have been overly complex

1342
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,559
because more than one

1343
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:35,839
organization has succeed

1344
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,559
excellent thank you our next question

1345
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,240
comes from john carson

1346
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,480
in your opinion how far has quantum

1347
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,680
communications

1348
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,280
with optical come for an interplanetary

1349
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,960
network

1350
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,880
well we're nowhere close to being able

1351
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,160
to maintain

1352
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,599
uh a an entangled state for the

1353
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,640
uh time delays that are required uh

1354
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,359
if it's uh even in seven minutes uh or

1355
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:02,720
well three and a half minutes is

1356
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,319
actually quite a long time

1357
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,280
to maintain a quantum entanglement which

1358
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,720
is what you need in order to have

1359
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,800
successful quantum communication

1360
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,559
there's work going on with quantum

1361
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,319
relays

1362
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,640
but again the interplanetary distances

1363
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,800
are really extreme

1364
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,599
uh and so um it's not yet clear i think

1365
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,640
the the longest

1366
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,400
anybody has ever transmitted and

1367
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,960
received and tangled photon is on the

1368
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,760
order

1369
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,440
i want to say 1500 kilometers of chinese

1370
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,319
going from a ground station through a

1371
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,119
satellite

1372
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,800
and then back down to another ground

1373
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,280
station those numbers will get bigger

1374
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,240
over time but

1375
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,599
um not particularly

1376
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,680
attractive for even to the movement back

1377
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,839
uh which is we're still only talking two

1378
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,079
and a half seconds of round trip time

1379
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,559
uh so as excited as many of us have

1380
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:55,440
become about

1381
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,839
the possibility of quantum internet and

1382
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,200
quantum relays

1383
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,160
uh we're really far far away from no pun

1384
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,280
intended

1385
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,319
from being able to maintain

1386
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,079
quantum entanglement long enough for

1387
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,880
that to be useful

1388
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,040
thank you our next question comes from

1389
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,800
michael doherty

1390
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
has there been any thought or planning

1391
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,280
for voice or video in the bundle

1392
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,720
protocols as either their own protocol

1393
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,520
or some type of layered application

1394
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,240
similar to the existing osi

1395
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,880
so the answer is uh first of all osi

1396
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,760
doesn't exist

1397
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,960
uh osi is the fantasy

1398
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,200
of them not to be overly pejorative it's

1399
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,079
a nice

1400
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,960
architectural description of layering uh

1401
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,040
and but not to be nitpicky

1402
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,359
uh the answer is yes uh we have indeed

1403
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,119
tested both voice and video with the

1404
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,640
bundle protocol

1405
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,359
uh keep in mind that interactive voice

1406
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,000
and video

1407
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,760
doesn't work unless the latencies are

1408
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,440
fairly low

1409
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,839
and we have been testing the capability

1410
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,520
of the bundle protocol to do

1411
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,040
for example multicasting and to do

1412
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,280
interactive real time when the

1413
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,640
conditions permit

1414
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,839
so for example a local terrestrial

1415
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,400
implementation of the bundle protocol

1416
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,520
can indeed run uh an interactive and

1417
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,680
video or audio session

1418
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,319
however when you get far enough apart so

1419
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,160
the latencies are high

1420
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,720
uh interaction doesn't work anymore and

1421
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,440
you end up

1422
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,480
basically sending video clips or audio

1423
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,359
clips

1424
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,040
along with text as if it were an email

1425
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,960
and and i expect that will be the

1426
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
primary interaction

1427
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,000
for any of the deep space missions

1428
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,960
until such time as subspace radio gets

1429
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,359
invented by somebody in the 24th century

1430
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,559
thank you our next question comes from

1431
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,559
leo vagoda

1432
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,240
yes how does the network prioritize

1433
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,040
traffic when a relay has more than its

1434
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,040
outbound capacity

1435
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,240
in its store and forward buffer yeah

1436
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,280
very good question

1437
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,280
and we've incorporated into the bubble

1438
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,119
protocol notions of

1439
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,119
uh priority and also notions of

1440
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,640
expiration so

1441
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,119
it's uh just as in the uh in the

1442
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,079
internet uh

1443
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,160
where we use hop camp for for that

1444
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,319
purpose uh there's a mechanism in the

1445
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,240
bundle protocol to decide that a

1446
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,720
particular bundle is no longer useful to

1447
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,359
be transmitted because its utility is

1448
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,559
expired

1449
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,040
so we have provision for prioritization

1450
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,400
within the

1451
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,400
bundle protocol node and

1452
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,640
we will also have to figure out how to

1453
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,559
deal with flow control

1454
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,520
which is still i would say a work in

1455
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,040
progress

1456
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,599
to try to avoid overloading resources in

1457
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,960
any particular bundle now

1458
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,359
brian holloway asked a question about

1459
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,280
ntp and he thanks

1460
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,400
matt pitock um for asking it and that

1461
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,559
you answered it already

1462
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,400
so moving right along our next question

1463
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,160
is from scott johnson

1464
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,440
theoretically then in the event of a

1465
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,040
large-scale

1466
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,319
colony large-scale colonization

1467
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,319
an instance of the internet could be

1468
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,559
implemented interestingly online

1469
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,520
terrestrially

1470
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,720
on mars so the answer is yes

1471
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,480
if we can implement it on earth we could

1472
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,319
certainly implement it on mars it does

1473
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,000
raise some interesting questions though

1474
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,800
because

1475
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,599
the implementations on earth have taken

1476
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,880
advantage of

1477
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,800
a number of uh technologies and their

1478
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,640
support structure for example fiber

1479
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,040
optic networks and things of that kind

1480
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,960
what isn't so clear is which

1481
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,200
technologies will be sustainable

1482
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,440
on mars even in the presence of

1483
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,880
colonization

1484
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,200
so it might be that we have a more

1485
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,040
limited choice of implementation

1486
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,280
it could be that we could use local

1487
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,160
networking

1488
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,480
with both radio and maybe even ethernet

1489
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,839
style things

1490
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,160
um but you know we might not be able to

1491
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:00,960
use

1492
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,079
optical fiber to connect any significant

1493
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,160
portions of mars together just because

1494
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,520
of the

1495
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,839
challenge of implementing that and so

1496
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,920
radio and satellite relay might turn out

1497
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,800
to be

1498
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,240
more likely uh for a mars colonization

1499
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,920
case especially if the colonies are

1500
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,200
scattered apart

1501
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,520
uh with some distance between them i

1502
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,280
would doubt seriously that they would be

1503
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,359
able to do a

1504
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,720
a mars-based fiber optic network

1505
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,160
of the sort that we've been able to

1506
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,000
implement here on earth simply because

1507
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,880
of the

1508
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,240
challenge of both implementing

1509
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,720
maintaining it

1510
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,160
scott also commented uh ip address

1511
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,799
uh collision could be avoided by adding

1512
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,160
a single bit

1513
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,040
uh defining which internet to route to

1514
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,799
when we get three internets though

1515
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,920
we all have to add another bit smiling

1516
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,119
well

1517
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,640
we would not use the addressing

1518
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,480
structure we would keep the networks

1519
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,240
completely segregated they would not

1520
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,599
appear to be

1521
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,000
uh interconnected at all none of them

1522
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,400
could directly address the others

1523
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,240
which is why we chose the uh the

1524
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,319
two-step bundle protocol addressing

1525
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,640
structure for endpoint identifiers

1526
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,599
so as to not complete uh ip addressing

1527
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,240
on earth with ip addressing on mars or

1528
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,799
on the moon or elsewhere if we choose to

1529
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:19,599
use

1530
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,000
internet at all on any of those

1531
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,760
locations

1532
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,040
okay uh our next question is

1533
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,839
from gavin mcmillan and we only have

1534
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:30,559
about

1535
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,680
two minutes left um what about asteroid

1536
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,280
collision

1537
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,240
well asteroids are a real hazard and uh

1538
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,440
of course that will be true

1539
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,400
for people going to mars uh or further

1540
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,240
out in the solar system

1541
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,799
uh so one thing you hope for is that we

1542
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,000
have adequate tracking

1543
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,119
of asteroids so that we can avoid uh

1544
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,599
collisions uh but they will happen and

1545
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,359
some of you may have read about some

1546
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,200
it's not an asteroid it is actually just

1547
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,720
a piece of depth which is from

1548
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,559
other satellites that hit the

1549
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,319
international space station

1550
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:05,520
uh robot arm recently

1551
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,079
uh so the answer is uh that's always a

1552
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,359
potential hazard

1553
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,160
and we hope that for any significant

1554
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,799
size asteroids that we would be able to

1555
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:15,760
track them

1556
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,280
there's a lot of work going on right now

1557
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,520
to identify potential

1558
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,559
uh asteroid hazards for earth um

1559
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,520
i don't know there's very much going on

1560
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,000
for

1561
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,640
um other missions you know that are on

1562
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,359
their way to the outer planets

1563
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,319
but there is a great deal of work to

1564
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,839
track at least some portion of the

1565
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,200
asteroid belt

1566
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,960
uh to avoid trajectories that might in

1567
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,839
fact

1568
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,880
produce a collision i'd be worried about

1569
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,680
uh coronal mass objections too as

1570
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,879
another possible hazard

1571
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,400
our last question comes from jorge amada

1572
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,880
question is there a simulated test

1573
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,079
network available for

1574
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,599
develop there is a simulation it's not

1575
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,359
even a simulation it's actually a

1576
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,160
laboratory

1577
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,640
arrangement with most of the nasa

1578
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,400
laboratories and some others of the

1579
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,160
other space agencies

1580
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,440
part of it what we'll call a dtn bone uh

1581
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,000
so we're using that to uh test new

1582
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,920
versions of the protocols and to put

1583
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,040
them into

1584
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,880
uh simulated environments where we

1585
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,880
introduce artificial delay and things of

1586
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,319
that sort

1587
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,640
we are frankly also hoping to engage

1588
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,319
with the general public by putting the

1589
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,359
protocols into

1590
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,280
the various cloud operations like

1591
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,559
google's

1592
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,000
google's cloud and amazon and microsoft

1593
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,160
uh and making those available at least

1594
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,359
through

1595
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,160
apps that might run on either laptop or

1596
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,520
mobile

1597
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,880
to exercise the system and allow us to

1598
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,359
observe how well it functions at scale

1599
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,680
if we have a large enough population of

1600
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,880
terrestrial users to let us

1601
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,119
push a lot of traffic into the system so

1602
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,799
i hope you'll be hearing more about that

1603
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,240
from the ipm special interest group

1604
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,240
ipnc.org

1605
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,799
then thank you very much for your

1606
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,559
presentation and your time today

1607
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,280
to answer uh some questions and answers

1608
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,880
we do appreciate it from the nanak

1609
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,640
happy to uh to draw this to your

1610
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,720
attention you can you can imagine that

1611
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,240
this is a whole new

1612
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,280
uh environment and parametric space in

1613
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,359
which to think about network operations

1614
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,000
so

1615
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,240
i'm happy to have a chance to sort of

1616
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,040
jog your your imagination a bit

1617
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,960
thank you very much we do appreciate it

1618
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,559
thank you take care

1619
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:37,839
bye see you on the net

1620
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:49,520
your question is which one thank you
