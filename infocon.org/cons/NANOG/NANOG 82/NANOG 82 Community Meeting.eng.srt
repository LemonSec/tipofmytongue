[Music]

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,480
um

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,000
i'd like to kind of start out the

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,599
community meeting and can i give you

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,040
kind of a directive of what the

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,799
organization is doing

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,800
um sorry

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,199
but um before i start i want to kind of

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,880
reflect a little bit on the past 12

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,920
months that

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,840
have occurred within our country and

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,599
across the world and the challenges

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,840
it's been a bit of a chaotic year

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,120
but all great changes are

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,040
preceded by chaos

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,320
and rather than reflecting on the chaos

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
itself i want to

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,920
reflect on what chaos invokes and which

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,000
is change

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,440
to improve is to change so to be perfect

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,719
is to have changed often so change in

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,199
itself

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,239
is the path toward perfection

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,000
it is not the strongest of the species

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that survive nor the most intelligent

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,159
but the one most responsive to change

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,840
change or go extinct

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
sorry um change is scary but change is

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,799
necessary

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,960
change is the law of life and those who

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,320
look only to the past

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,559
and the present are certain to miss the

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,320
future so

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,200
change is the gateway to the future so

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
here at nano we've been focusing over

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,880
this past year of ways that we can

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,479
change and improve our environment to

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,400
better suit not only our community

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,680
but also to better suit our community at

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,000

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
those people who extend out yes and as i

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,759

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
i want to focus on those things that

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
we've been doing as an organization to

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,240
respond to the change

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,840
that's happened kind of in the world

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
around us in an effort to better our

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399

a lot of effort in energy into

140

updating our back-end systems in an

141
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,520
effort to provide better services to our

142

take advantage of some of the software

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,120
that we've developed we're not in

156
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,639
competition with one another we're all

157

functions

166
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,479

uh we're sorry we're going to be

173
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,280
creating an appointment tool an effort

174
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,600

learning management system to connect

179
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
and leverage the efforts whether we're

180
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,759
doing an education

181
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,039
um we're going to be creating some

182
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,880
sponsorship tools to help better serve

183
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,319

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,199
help support nano and we'll be uh adding

185
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,039
more updates to the program

186
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,080
tool itself if i can get google slides

187
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,039
to behave itself

188
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,560
so administrative updates so

so edward thank you for having us here

217
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
today and i hope everybody can relate to

218
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,440
speaking on mute

219
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,599
so we on the program this research

220
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,039
started because we on the program

221
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,919
committee

222
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,039
had an idea that the

223
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,199
that we are producing less number of

224
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,360
talks now postcoded than we've been

225
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
putting on pre-code

226
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
so i i started to look into the numbers

227
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,879
and the numbers proved out

228
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,440
i looked at six nanogs three pre-covered

229
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
76 77 and 78

230
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,879
and three post covered 79 80 and 81 and

231
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,800
what i saw was that on average

232
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,599
on pre-cover nano 76 77 and 78 we are

233
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
putting on an average of 29

234
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,759
community talks and postcode we're

235
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,879
putting on 17.

236
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,960
and by community talks i mean talks that

237
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,240
are submitted

238
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,639
by volunteers in the community i this is

239
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,440
i'm not

240
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,639
i took out the talks that our kind of

241
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,960
uh program committee generated meaning

242
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,199
the opening the closing the hackathon

243
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,280
the community meeting etc so we're

244
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
really just looking here at the

245
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,800
community talks that are coming in

246
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,400
so this data is looking at the last uh

247
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,360
six nanogs how those talks broke down

248
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,719
and just so you have an idea of the

249
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,440
numbers

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
i looked at 254 talks over the past six

251
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,000
nanox

252
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,839
uh they it actually came to a total of

253
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,000
274

254
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
tickets because some of the talks were

255
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,279
kind of canceled

256
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,320
and withdrawn and then recreated so

257
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,720
it's 274 tickets and this is the

258
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
breakdown of what happened with each of

259
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
those 274 tickets

260
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
so on average the number proved out to

261
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
what we have seen in the past which was

262
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,240
we're accepting around 50

263
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
of the talks that come in that's this

264
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
136 talks

265
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,560
there are a couple ways of describing

266
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
six other ways of describing that the

267
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,519
talk isn't moving forward either

268
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
permanently or not yet

269
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,040
three ways of describing the talk isn't

270
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,640
moving forward at all and that's

271
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,440
declined

272
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
it's withdrawn or it's canceled and

273
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,279
three ways of describing that

274
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,959
we're waiting for something more and

275
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,839
that's pending deferred or conditional

276
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,240
and and the way this breaks out is so

277
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,519
fifty percent of the tax

278
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,640
were accepted about 42 of the tax were

279
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:30,880
in

280
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,279
declined withdrawn or canceled and eight

281
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,360
percent of the tax were impending or

282
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,880
conditional meaning just deferred to a

283
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,480
later time so i wanted to take a look at

284
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,720
why uh the overtime what is the category

285
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,399
that talks that were happening with

286
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,959
talks and and just so you have an idea

287
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,399
when we kind of had this idea that

288
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,920
we weren't that we weren't putting out

289
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,000
as many talks it was our presupposition

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,519
at that time that we weren't

291
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,279
accepting as many talks because we were

292
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,120
not getting as many talks into the

293
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
program

294
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,959
and um and what the data showed is that

295
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,440
in fact we were receiving as many talks

296
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,480
in the program

297
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,760
pre as post pandemic but we were not

298
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
we didn't actually publish as many talks

299
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,480
and so this answers the question of why

300
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
is that and unfortunately what this

301
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,800
showed is that in the pre-pandemic talks

302
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
our largest category was

303
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
in the withdrawn state and post-pandemic

304
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
the largest category of wyatt didn't go

305
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,760
forward

306
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,480
was because it was in the decline state

307
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,000
and then nanak 81

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,560
but the biggest category was it was in a

309
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,600
pending state

310
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
so i started asking the question of why

311
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,160
are more talks being declined

312
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,880
and here's a graph showing basically

313
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,000
we're only looking at the

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
decline number of talks right now the

315
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,279
biggest reason that talks are being

316
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,959
declined is because there were no

317
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,720
presentation materials uploaded to the

318
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,000
talk that's about 35

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
of our decline talks wind up in that

320
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,320
state uh 29

321
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,800
or 14 talks are declined because they

322
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,240
are basically what turns into

323
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,519
kind of product marketing material 18

324
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
of talks are talks that basically lacked

325
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,120
a compelling storyline

326
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,839
and 10 percent of talks we all agreed

327
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,360
together that the talk would be better

328
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,560
as a lightning talk

329
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
so all of these categories are pretty

330
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,399
well self-explanatory

331
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,240
everybody understands when there's no

332
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
presentation materials

333
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,880
uploaded to the talk that's easy enough

334
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,640
we can't accept a talk like that and

335
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,079
oftentimes that turns into

336
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,399
sometimes that turns into decline uh

337
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,240
product marketing everybody understands

338
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,959
that

339
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,640
it's the category of that the talk

340
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
lacked a compelling story

341
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,560
that can be the most controversial

342
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,839
people so i just wanted to

343
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,680
address that a little in a very general

344
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,320
way so everybody

345
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
could have an idea and say you have an

346
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,519
idea and it's a really good idea you

347
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,200
read the lobby book and you say

348
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,079
i'm going to do a talk on bgp and it's

349
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,839
basically going to be a tutorial

350
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,279
there's a built-in audience for that

351
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,680
because bgp is relevant to all of us

352
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
and that would be very well considered

353
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
in the nano program committee

354
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
and it can just be a straight explaining

355
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,959
here is what bgp is

356
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,120
and uh that would be a wonderful thing

357
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,639
to put on as a tutorial

358
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,399
if you did that if you had that kind of

359
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,680
thought though where it's just going to

360
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
be here it is abcd

361
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
with a very less well-known or a brand

362
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
new kind of technology

363
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,279
it would be hard to find that kind of

364
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,720
built-in audience

365
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,040
because it's less well-known it doesn't

366
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
have the kind of audience so

367
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,920
if that's the case we would really be

368
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,360
looking for the talk to have a very

369
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
compelling storyline

370
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480
and by a compelling storyline what that

371
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,079
means is

372
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,399
we would want to be asking the question

373
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,839
what was the problem

374
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,360
that you were trying to address that

375
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,959
caused you to look at this

376
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,200
and hopefully maybe not hopefully but

377
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
that problem would be

378
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,320
universal to a lot of different

379
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,560
companies and that problem is what would

380
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
generate the kind of audience that would

381
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,079
be interesting to our

382
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,639
community so so you'd be asking the

383
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,079
question of the data of the

384
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,480
in a talk of you're answering the

385
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,279
question

386
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,800
uh what was the problem we were trying

387
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,399
to address what were the other

388
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,320
technologies or other solutions that we

389
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,680
tried to come up with

390
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,600
to try to address this and why did we

391
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,440
decide on this as a solution

392
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,079
and how did the implementation go and

393
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,200
what was the outcome of that

394
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,079
implementation

395
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,600
and and that's really what we're talking

396
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,079
about when we are discussing

397
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,360
um a compelling storyline and and just

398
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,959
so you know we on the program committee

399
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,000
want

400
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,760
every single talk that comes in to be

401
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
given every consideration and we want

402
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
those talks to be successful

403
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,600
the rest of these categories there's not

404
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,440
much we can do about if somebody

405
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,920
submits an idea and then they don't put

406
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,760
any presentation materials with it

407
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,680
we can't help that and if it really is

408
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,279
essentially a product and marketing talk

409
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,480
we can't help that

410
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,399
and if it really is very short and it

411
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,760
would be better as a lightning talk

412
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
we can't help that but we can help the

413
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,959
talks that

414
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,560
lack a compelling storyline because we

415
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,079
can try to encourage the

416
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,199
person who submitted that talk into

417
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,399
um you know developing a storyline and

418
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,240
making it a better candidate for

419
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,600
acceptance

420
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,040
so i needed to look at why

421
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,680
pre and post covid what kind of talks

422
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,880
were being declined

423
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,560
and as you can see starting on the left

424
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
hand side here in dark green

425
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,639
is that there were no presentation

426
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,320
materials uploaded to the talk and we

427
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,839
had many of those pre-coded

428
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,120
and actually consider these kind of

429
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,199
talks to be kind of a bread and butter

430
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,120
of what we do on the program committee

431
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,000
because this is basically uh somebody

432
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,639
has been

433
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,680
struck by lightning and has an idea and

434
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
and says i need to give this talk at

435
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,160
nanog and they submit a ticket into us

436
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,000
and we like that and we you know if we

437
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,519
can get the materials in

438
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,959
those are great kind of talks that come

439
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,639
in and pre-nanag we had many of those

440
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,199
talks

441
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,279
and as you can see post-nano we did not

442
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,440
have as many of those talks

443
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,079
instead the category that really came up

444
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,600
was the category of

445
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,120
product pitch we saw an increase of a

446
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,480
huge increase

447
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,560
in the number of product pitch kind of

448
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,720
talks that were coming in

449
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,959
and and also the kind of talk a little

450
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,160
bit of the kind of talk that

451
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
lack of compelling storyline and you can

452
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
kind of see from this data

453
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,560
what was going on here what we saw was

454
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,480
that we were receiving the same number

455
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
of talks

456
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,680
uh postcoded but the nature of the talks

457
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,199
that we were receiving

458
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,360
shifted from those kind of bread and

459
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,600
butter and aspirational kind of talks

460
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,440
where somebody has an idea and submits a

461
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,240
proposal

462
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,320
into talks that are more of kind of on

463
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,600
the product pitch side

464
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
which which unfortunately automatically

465
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
um have less consideration by the

466
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,480
program committee

467
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
uh we all know that we and and we all

468
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
know we are an ecosystem

469
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,480
and every person who comes to nanaig is

470
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,880
valuable and we can't live without

471
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
the kind of

472
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,639
manufacturers and people who want to get

473
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,240
our products in front of it that network

474
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,759
doesn't operate without that kind of

475
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,759
people they're valued in the community

476
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,800
but our the people who attend nanag

477
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,079
as we know from the

478
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,639
from our chat are opinionated and vocal

479
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,320
and we appreciate that but

480
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
product pitch kind of talks aren't going

481
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
to go over so well with our community

482
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,519
so so that is really where we saw a

483
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,839
large portion of talks that were being

484
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,639
declined

485
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,360
postcoved as opposed to pre-covered so

486
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
so this is again just looking at

487
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,680
at these numbers um what i wanted to

488
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,240
address

489
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,680
was the difference in experienced

490
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,240
speakers versus brand new speakers

491
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,560
uh what we saw pre-covered

492
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
versus post covert our brand new speaker

493
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
numbers stayed about the same

494
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,360
our experienced speakers fell by a lot

495
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
and these are average numbers across

496
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,560
so when you look at that difference in

497
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,320
experienced speakers that's a difference

498
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,959
of 14

499
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,720
speakers um that we're submitting talks

500
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,000
per nano this this is a it's pretty

501
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,440
significant number of experienced

502
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,560
speakers and and

503
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,399
the way the numbers work out if we had

504
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,160
had the same decline in brand new

505
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,000
speakers as we had with experienced

506
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,079
speakers

507
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,480
we we would have seen a huge decline in

508
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
the volume of talks that were coming in

509
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,000
but i think the way this works with the

510
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,359
previous slide shown

511
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,760
in which we had so many more marketing

512
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,880
type um

513
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,199
presentations submitted that's why this

514
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,280
number of brand new speakers

515
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,839
became the same it's just the profile of

516
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,799
those speakers

517
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,839
shifted a little bit so finally i i

518
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,799
wanted to just

519
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,760
to reiterate so since the pandemic we

520
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,799
did see a drop

521
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,119
we definitely see a drop in the number

522
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,400
of talks that

523
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,679
we are putting out and publishing at

524
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,960
uh we the number of talks that are being

525
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,280
considered are the same but we

526
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,039
understand that the profile of talks

527
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,320
that we are seeing

528
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
has changed we know that less of our

529
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,520
experienced speakers are submitting

530
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,160
talks

531
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,240
and and we have heard from experienced

532
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
speakers that they are really waiting

533
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
until we get back in person until they

534
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,760
can give talks some people just don't

535
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,240
want to be on video and don't want

536
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,520
to go through the process of getting a

537
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,039
talk approved by an anag

538
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
for this kind of video and we really

539
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,559
look forward to coming out in anag so

540
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,360
that

541
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
we can get back to our normal levels

542
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,440
hopefully of having our experienced

543
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,240
speakers

544
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,679
we did see the same number of new

545
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,760
speakers submitting talks but the

546
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,160
profile of those speakers changed we

547
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,039
know that

548
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,679
the new speakers are um maybe a little

549
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,280
bit more in the product marketing

550
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,160
variety

551
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
and unfortunately more of those talks

552
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,200
are being declined

553
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
so this combination of factors explains

554
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,559
why there are fewer talks

555
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,799
being shown during nanog and this is

556
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,080
definitely something that we

557
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
are going to continue to keep an eye on

558
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,160
and we all know that there should be

559
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,679
really complete transparency about

560
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,480
the way this process works in nanog um

561
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,000
we understand that going through the

562
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,080
process of submitting talks at myanmark

563
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,280
and having it reviewed and

564
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,679
voted on is challenging it's our job to

565
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,919
be as communicative as we possibly can

566
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,200
as we work through it

567
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,640
and so the new and experienced speakers

568
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,799
who come to nanag are really valued

569
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,080
beyond belief

570
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,919
and they leave us with insights and

571
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,160
education that cannot possibly be found

572
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,280
anywhere else

573
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,200
and we hope that as we get back to

574
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,720
normal in person anags

575
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
those speakers who have been holding off

576
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,320
submitting talks until they can be in

577
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,039
person

578
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,880
start ramping those back up and we start

579
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
coming back to the numbers

580
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
of talks submitted and accepted that we

581
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,480
had

582
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,240
prior to the pandemic and we are

583
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,760
definitely looking forward to getting

584
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,880
back to normal

585
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,799
all right that's it i think og is up

586
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,679
next thank you

587
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,039
okay thank you uh elizabeth i must say

588
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,720
uh that he did a great job at

589
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,039
sharing insights of what has occurred in

590
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,640
the last few nights where the entire

591
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,000
program was delivered

592
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,919
in a virtual environment ahead of us

593
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,160
we're looking at a hybrid meeting where

594
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,679
we will combine the in-person

595
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,080
and virtual experiences of attending a

596
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
nano meeting

597
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,039
moving forward our commitment is to

598
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,799
always conduct our meetings in a hybrid

599
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,520
mode

600
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,440
at this where our community will benefit

601
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,840
to the full extent possible

602
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,000
we will continue with our efforts to

603
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
pre-record speakers

604
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,960
that will not be able to attend in

605
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,760
person we will allow for questions from

606
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,960
our audience attending in person and

607
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,320
from remote attendees with our hybrid

608
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,600
meeting we plan to go back

609
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,120
to our full three-day program

610
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
we will continue to focus on the quality

611
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,799
of a program

612
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,400
this is possible because of the great

613
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,159
speakers that take the time

614
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,880
to engage and give back to our community

615
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,960
thank you for doing that

616
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,799
we are excited to support the transition

617
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,480
to a hybrid meeting

618
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,559
and take every opportunity to make

619
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,080
things better

620
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,559
the nanok program committee has taken

621
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,400
steps to proactively reach out to

622
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,919
potential speakers

623
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,960
on topic of interest uh

624
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,039
to our community uh we acknowledge the

625
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,880
fact that not everybody on the program

626
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,520
comedian was comfortable at reaching out

627
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,559
we shared

628
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,200
guidance on ways to politely ask without

629
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
intruding

630
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
um everything that nanak the program

631
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,039
committee does is for the benefit of our

632
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,039
community

633
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,039
thanks to elizabeth again a list of

634
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,360
speakers that presented the most over

635
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,679
the years was put together

636
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,360
our first step was to reach out to the

637
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
top for 20.

638
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,840
we found that to be a helpful exercise

639
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,760
and expect to see results

640
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,200
in our next meeting

641
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,120
in the past a lot of voting and

642
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,280
accepting of talks was done at a

643
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,360
predetermined time period

644
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,760
for every meeting and we have evolved

645
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,039
that process

646
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,280
into reviewing and accepting talks as

647
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,320
soon as they become

648
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,960
available we continue to evolve and

649
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,600
mature

650
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,679
the process of reviewing accepting talks

651
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,640
to be added to the nanook program

652
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,080
for those of you that are planning to

653
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,919
submit talk ideas

654
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,159
uh we want to take a moment to remind

655
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,960
you to take the time to recognize people

656
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,000
that supported you with your content

657
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,039
for your presentation we continue to

658
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,000
encourage folks to

659
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
do that most recently we had a case that

660
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
we had to follow up on

661
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,280
because we felt it was the right thing

662
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,679
to do to recognize contribution

663
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,720
in addition we added disclaimer text to

664
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,919
our presentation submission agreement

665
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,159
basically uh for those of you submitting

666
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:18,960
a talk

667
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360

668
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,799

673
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320

677
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,000
be committed to building the best

678
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
program possible for every meeting

679
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,640
all of that is driven by the feedback

680
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,880
that we receive from our community

681
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,120
here is another example how the nano

682
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,679
program committee continues to evolve

683
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,799
what we did is we created a new role to

684
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,080
help offload work

685
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,360
from the program committee

686
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
and from the shepherds and what was

687
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,559
happening in the past was um a lot of

688
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,000
the work to

689
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,600
review presentations was done mostly by

690
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,000
the

691
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,120
program committee secretary and we found

692
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,440
that was best to distribute that

693
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,600
work and now that's uh being

694
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,640
the task is on the content reviewers

695
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,480
they're the ones that make sure that we

696
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
follow standards for recording and

697
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,400
live presentations in addition the

698
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,840
content reviewer takes the time to

699
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,400
approve the final slides to be published

700
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,360
on the program

701
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,200
and prepare speaker introductions

702
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,440
finally an update on how our program

703
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,039
committee mentorship program is

704
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,640
progressing

705
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,400
volunteers in the program committee come

706
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
and go over the years

707
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,039
this is part of our existing process

708
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,320
the intent of this program is to guide

709
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,960
new proven committee members

710
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,240
and what we did is we

711
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,080
we match experienced program committee

712
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,480
members with new members

713
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,760
and here's some of the results we

714
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,919
encouraged direct contact to allow for

715
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,080
open communication

716
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,600
we the the program helped

717
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,440
align with the primary goals for the

718
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,360
program committee

719
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,279
we quickly quickly discovered what the

720
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,520
mentees had interest in helping

721
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,279
with found that

722
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,960
found where people can bring the most to

723
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,720
value

724
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,279
overall the i must say the program

725
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,200
mentorship program has been a success

726
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
and we plan to continue

727
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,840
in the future

728
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,400
next we will continue with the poll

729
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,880
questions thank you

730
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,400
so before i start into the whole

731
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,320
questions during the process of my

732
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,360
presentation

733
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,679
um google decided to eat a few of my

734
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,480
slides so

735
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,760
there's a couple things i want to talk

736
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
about before we head into polls

737
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,679
one i wanted to just discuss briefly

738
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,200
some of the development efforts that

739
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,039
we've done recently that you're now

740
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,480
experienced as part of some of the

741
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
changes at nanak

742
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
um one is that we've created a new event

743
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
management system

744
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,279
in the past our events were kind of

745
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,039
separated into certain categories and

746
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,679
they had

747
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,120
they were displayed in different parts

748
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,360
of our website they're now consolidated

749
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,240
into one

750
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,559
particular section where we manage all

751
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,080
of our events

752
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,279
anything from conferences to outreach

753
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,799
events

754
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,960
to member meetings etc will all be found

755
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,799
there we're also going to be opening

756
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,919
this up to

757
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,400
uh third parties so for example if aaron

758
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
wanted to list and host their meetings

759
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,320
there they could as well and as i

760
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,600
mentioned earlier we're going to be

761
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,840
opening up these tools to

762
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,520
nogs for them to be able to leverage

763
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,080
them as well going forward

764
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,840
you've also now experienced our new

765
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,600
event registration system

766
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
we've now moved away from cvent and we

767
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,279
are now

768
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,880
kind of hosting all of our event

769
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,480
management internally

770
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,159
um the goal there is to give you a much

771
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,640
smoother experience than what you've uh

772
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,799
experienced in the past and also because

773
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,480
it's it's driven for the needs of our

774
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,120
community

775
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
it can evolve to help serve our

776
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,559
particular needs as well

777
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,840
um we're now able to bundle um

778
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
member registration into that and we're

779
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,320
also able to put donations into that

780
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,720
um you can also take and register

781
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
multiple people at the same time so

782
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,559
again all these things done in effort to

783
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,799
better serve our community

784
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,480
we also as i mentioned before i've done

785
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,240
updates program tool

786
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,559
and we've also done some extensive

787
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,880
upgrades to our the nanoloc navigation

788
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,440
system

789
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,799
to make sure that it's easier for you to

790
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,200
access and find um things

791
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,480
and then the last thing i want to talk

792
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,320
about before i jump into polls

793
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,720
and that is our community forum our

794
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
discourse community forum is now

795
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,880
open for public beta we kind of

796
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,080
encourage your feedback and

797
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,200
participation

798
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,039
if you go to community.nanog.org

799
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,200
it will then jump you over back to our

800
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,960
nanak website where you'll be

801
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
validated through our oauth2 server and

802
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,600
then you'll be able to take and kick the

803
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,679
tires and play around within the

804
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,960
community forum

805
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,279
um one thing to bear in mind is that the

806
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,159
mailing list is

807
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,159
mirrored in the community forum it is

808
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,919
read only access

809
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,600
but it's great the way it presents and

810
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
you're able to to search through and

811
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,640
find things that are there

812
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,480
um again this isn't beta we're looking

813
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
for community feedback and kind of how

814
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,760
we move forward and what we do in terms

815
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,240
of

816
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,919
uh providing you with the best tools

817
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,080
possible to participate within our

818
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
nanonod community

819
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,960
that being said i will move on to polls

820
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
so if you want to participate in our

821
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,720
polls um you can go to

822
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,559

at poll everywhere dot com slash

828
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,919
mobile so um that being said

829
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,240
let's jump on to our first uh pulp

830
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,200
question

831
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,679
and the first question is are you

832
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,120
planning to attend

833
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,159
um uh in person for nanak 83 in

834
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,279
minneapolis

835
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,720
and what we'll do is we'll take a couple

836
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
of minutes this is a live polling system

837
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,120
as

838
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,080
people add kind of responses to the

839
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,640
polls

840
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
it'll update in real time so we give

841
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,480
ourselves a minute to

842
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,399
get some feedback and results here

843
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
and we also are going to have a survey

844
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,840
which is asking similar questions

845
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,919
the benefit of this poll is a chance for

846
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,520
the audience that we have live to just

847
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,080
get some feedback on what they think

848
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,159
and get some real-time data

849
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,159
i personally am going um i guess i'm the

850
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,360
executive director i really don't have

851
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,200
my choice but i want to go anyway

852
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,279
um i'm really all vaccinated ready to

853
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,640
get there it'll be good to see the

854
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,480
community and disconnect

855
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
and um just be in the same space with

856
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,399
everybody so

857
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,039
as the years have gone by i'm quite fond

858
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:01,440
of the

859
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,120
nano community and i'm looking forward

860
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:12,159
to being in face to face with everyone

861
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,039
okay thank you all for that information

862
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,159
let me

863
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,320
switch to let's give it another second

864
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:27,840
i feel like i'm getting feedback

865
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
all right i'll give it another 10

866
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,120
seconds then i'll close that poll and

867
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:55,840
we'll jump on to the next one

868
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,960
okay so let's shift on to the next poll

869
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,640
so how many of you have taken the kobit

870
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,840
19

871
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,399
vaccine

872
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,880
press the wrong button so i'll give you

873
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,240
guys a chance to reset that one

874
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,200
now looks like a lot of people have

875
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,960
it's funny sometimes people were having

876
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,799
various kind of side effects

877
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,120
when i took the first vaccine i had

878
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,320
vertigo for about

879
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,679
um at least a week i got up try to get

880
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,720
out of the bed that morning and

881
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,320
literally it took me five minutes to get

882
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,080
out of bed my head was spitting so bad i

883
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,919
just kept hitting back there but

884
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,559
i'm fine now

885
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
again thank you all for kind of

886
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,559
contributing to this really kind of

887
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,240
helps us get an idea of what's going on

888
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,519
within our community

889
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,200
as i mentioned before we have other

890
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,960
surveys which are going on so

891
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,559
if you look into the meeting pages look

892
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,159
down and find surveys

893
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,600
and there's other surveys that we'd love

894
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
you to participate in to give feedback

895
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,120
we are community driven

896
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,799
and we serve our community so any

897
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,320
feedback you give us is

898
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,919
very helpful in helping us plan and

899
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,440
prepare things as an organization

900
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,159
okay so let's move on to our next

901
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:28,640
question

902
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,840
and that's regards to um mentorship

903
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,240
so are you interested in becoming a

904
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,640
mentor

905
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,880
you know our mentorship program and our

906
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,720
educational programs are both really

907
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,360
designed

908
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,480
to kind of uh formalize our educational

909
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,120
process

910
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,399
um uh in from my protect particular uh

911
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,399
perspective nanak has been educational

912
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,960
but primarily in a passive sense

913
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,880
where these new mentorship and education

914
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,159
programs are designed

915
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,159
to make us more uh more active and

916
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,919
strategic in the way that we

917
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,000
educate our community and as we bring

918
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,519
more people into our community

919
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,440
to provide educational opportunities for

920
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,519
them our focus is

921
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,440
is to get more people involved and

922
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,120
engaged in the network operator

923
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,360
community in terms of participating in

924
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,960
analog and even more so

925
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,880
in terms of careers right now our

926
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,640
industry has an issue where there are

927
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,120
more

928
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,799
job openings and there are people to

929
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,960
fill them and we're hoping that nano

930
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,080
could kind of help

931
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,440
support that process of getting more

932
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
people engaged and involved in looking

933
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,159
at careers

934
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,240
in network engineering a lot of our

935
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,840
outreach programs are targeted toward

936
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,480
that

937
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,960
so any guidance and feedback you can

938
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,480
give us in these areas are extremely

939
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,320
helpful

940
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,720
okay so let's move on to the final

941
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,120
question

942
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,840
are you interested in being a mentee

943
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,880
it's been a pleasure to for me to

944
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,320
participate in both the

945
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,279
mentorship educational committees we

946
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,880
have some great people involved

947
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,559
they've kind of put forth some wonderful

948
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,760
ideas it's a very collaborative process

949
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,640
and all of them care about our community

950
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,000
and all of them are putting a lot of

951
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,960
energy and effort

952
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,919
into um you know finding ways that we

953
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:26,240
can

954
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,080
improve the offerings that we have to

955
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,919
our community very excited about the

956
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:30,880
process

957
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,600
and i think that you will be as well so

958
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,960
we'll be making some

959
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,240
big announcements in our uh november

960
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,120
meeting

961
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,600
for nanak 83 about these programs so

962
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:53,200
stay tuned

963
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
okay seems like that's stabilized so

964
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,559
thank you all for

965
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,760
um for helping out and giving us this

966
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,440
feedback

967
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,840
so now let's open up for question and

968
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,840
answer

969
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,359
we'll start from the top um one of our

970
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,199
first questions comes in

971
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,239
asking why do we limit the nog axis to

972
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,079
our tools to just north american

973
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,719
dogs couldn't other regions also benefit

974
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,560
from these tools

975
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,320
um right now we're just we're kind of

976
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,159
like the walk before we can run

977
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,918
right now it's in beta phase we're going

978
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,679
to open up to people within the north

979
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,159
american

980
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,159
region that doesn't mean we won't open

981
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,280
up beyond that

982
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,918
um i'm personally not opposed that that

983
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,679
would be kind of a board level uh

984
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,719
decision

985
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,480
so um we'll see how things run through

986
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,000
our beta testing and then we'll take it

987
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,879
from there and then we had several

988
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,719
people commenting about the

989
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,280
um no presentation materials uploaded

990
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,719
comment about maybe putting those in

991
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,679
different categories

992
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,160
um such as maybe abandoned or incomplete

993
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,359
and there was a follow-up question

994
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,160
related to that

995
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,320
said you declined has there been any

996
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,240
further dive into the reasons why people

997
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,960
don't upload their presentations

998
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,320
i mean that's a good one for answering

999
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,599
this you know if we've reached out at

1000
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,359
all

1001
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,640
yeah i think that is a really good

1002
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,720
question i do not believe that we on the

1003
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,839
program committee have reached out i

1004
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:20,960
always thought it had

1005
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,119
led back to the idea of people submit

1006
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,800
talks based on these really kind of an

1007
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,240
aspirational idea

1008
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,280
where you come up with an idea that is

1009
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,119
really good and you submit it to nanag

1010
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,359
and then you stop having time to attend

1011
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,400
to it that much

1012
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,280
and that's really what leads to then no

1013
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,800
presentations get

1014
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,119
uh no presentation material gets

1015
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,560
accepted but it is kind of an

1016
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,680
interesting idea of

1017
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,599
do we want to split out declined in

1018
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,280
several different ways so that

1019
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,720
it's clearer to talks do get declined

1020
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,480
why that has happened and that's

1021
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,599
something i think we could definitely

1022
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,880
talk about and think about if we want to

1023
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,960
move forward on

1024
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,079
i definitely agree um we also have a

1025
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:00,960
good question

1026
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,119
here um what are the opportunities

1027
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,960
organization needs requirements

1028
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
and processes for someone who wants to

1029
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,320
volunteer for a role in nanog

1030
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,839
um i guess that would fall to me um

1031
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,760
first of all you can always reach out to

1032
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,440
me my email addresses

1033
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,560
emicnair nanak.org and i'm happy to kind

1034
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,880
of correspond with you directly

1035
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,640
ways that you can participate one that

1036
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,079
there are several committees there's a

1037
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,359
program committee

1038
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,680
where we have nominations that take

1039
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,359
place in the early part of the year for

1040
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,680
getting people involved in that

1041
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,240
we have our education and mentorship

1042
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,359
committees

1043
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,040
right now those are form but as we go

1044
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,000
forward they're going to be great

1045
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,280
opportunities for mentorship

1046
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,800
there's going to be great opportunities

1047
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,200
for helping to develop curriculum

1048
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,960
also to be able to present curriculum as

1049
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
well and to present as a as

1050
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,839
uh as a mentor as i mentioned earlier um

1051
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,280
we have our outreach

1052
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,839
committee that

1053
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,560
so as we kind of move forward um 2020

1054
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
and 2021 are kind of building years

1055
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,760
where we're taking

1056
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,000
uh the board starting prior to the real

1057
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,800
2020

1058
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,040
in late 2019 had come up with a

1059
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,160
strategic plan

1060
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,000
that strategic plan was kind of set on

1061
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,079
its ear by the pandemic

1062
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,760
um but you're going to especially see as

1063
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,359
we reach into 2022

1064
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,240
there's going to be lots of

1065
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,000
opportunities for people to serve within

1066
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,359
our community so

1067
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,400
um stay tuned we'll be bringing updates

1068
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,920
on our website and out through social

1069
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,880
media et cetera

1070
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,640
about some of the opportunities to serve

1071
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,680
our uh community

1072
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,480
and i'm gonna read tony's comment it's

1073
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,839
not really a question but more of a

1074
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,119
statement i think is a good one for

1075
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:37,920
everyone to hear

1076
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,599
um so tony mentioned when i was on the

1077
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,359
pc sometimes it seemed that people

1078
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,440
didn't follow up with the presentation

1079
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,400
because they were looking to get

1080
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,480
accepted before developing the slides

1081
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,079
but need to understand that that's now

1082
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,480
not how the nano pc does things

1083
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,760
i explained it like we needed to see

1084
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,200
more about the level of detail through

1085
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,160
slides

1086
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,359
though the slides didn't need to be

1087
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,880
final but could be refined later i think

1088
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,240
that's a really good point that tony

1089
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,760
points out that i just wanted to read

1090
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,960
out loud for everybody

1091
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,200
um we need to see something to start

1092
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,079
analyzing and

1093
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,839
make a decision obviously accepted so

1094
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,880
please keep that in mind when you're

1095
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,079
submitting talks

1096
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,440
um and also keep in mind that we're

1097
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,040
doing rolling acceptances and rolling

1098
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,880
submissions so you can submit now for a

1099
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,119
couple nags away if you need more time

1100
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,839
so if there's any other questions please

1101
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,920
paste them into the chat in the q a tab

1102
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,880
um one other comment in here is that

1103
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,839
someone would love to see some of the

1104
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,240
topics that were abandoned

1105
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,680
um if there is enough interest could

1106
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,440
there be an offer to anonymize the

1107
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,640
slides and offer up the talk

1108
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,720
presentation for someone else to present

1109
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,759
that's an interesting question

1110
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,320
i mean that's certainly possible i

1111
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,240
suppose

1112
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,880
yeah uh katasaki was gonna say that

1113
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,240
we've seen this happen sometimes to

1114
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,119
where

1115
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,880
um you're part of an organization and

1116
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,400
you volunteer somebody else

1117
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,079
a member of your team to actually

1118
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,680
present on your behalf especially when

1119
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,200
this is a teamwork

1120
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,640
so we've seen that happen in the past

1121
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,240
and it's been successful not everybody's

1122
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,119
comfortable

1123
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,880
coming up on stage and presenting on

1124
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
something so

1125
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,079
you should look at doing more of that

1126
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,119
that'll be our recommendation so i i

1127
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,599
just wanted to say i think this would be

1128
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,440
what i would actually really like to see

1129
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
is to bring down the level of stress

1130
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,599
that's associated with putting in a talk

1131
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,280
to nanak and the only way that we can do

1132
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
that is improve the transparency

1133
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,200
about the conversation that's happening

1134
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,280
within the program committee about the

1135
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,000
talk

1136
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,920
because by bringing down the level of

1137
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,280
stress i mean it shouldn't be just a

1138
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,040
black box you throw your idea out and

1139
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,119
you get a yes or no back

1140
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,359
there is generally and there should be

1141
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,280
you know even more going forward real

1142
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,560
communication about

1143
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,240
if there is something that's stopping

1144
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,920
this thing from going forward what is it

1145
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,960
exactly

1146
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,160
and if it's something that can be

1147
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,000
changed you know some pretty clear steps

1148
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,720
about

1149
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,640
what should be changed in that i would

1150
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,760
let i would love it if

1151
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,800
everybody felt like they can you know

1152
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,400
have a great idea

1153
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
make a ticket with it have us consider

1154
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
it and we are going to need to see some

1155
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,200
ideas but

1156
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,640
you know feel like it's going to be

1157
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,319
treated with the respect that it

1158
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,520
absolutely deserves

1159
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,079
and the attention that it deserves all

1160
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,280
right well thank you all for the

1161
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,839
questions

1162
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,240
and thank you for your presentation and

1163
