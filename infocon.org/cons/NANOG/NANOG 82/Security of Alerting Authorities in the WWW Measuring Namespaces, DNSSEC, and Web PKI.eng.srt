00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,080
hello everyone

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,600
and welcome to our presentation on

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,280
security of alerting authorities in the

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,480
world wide web

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,400
this is a joint work with eric johann

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,080
thomas and matthias

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,239
and i am point for twitter ronnie a phd

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,840
student at whitestone bomb institute in

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,279
berlin

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,720
so during crisis emergencies um

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,119
and disasters people rely on trustworthy

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:25,920
sources for

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,720
information as well as for services and

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,279
one

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,199
good source to get that information and

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,558
services is via

18
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,840
the web portals of a respective

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,200
organization and entities

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
as you can see on the right hand side uh

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,239
in the

22
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,920
in february last year as the corona

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,559
pandemic

24
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,680
was spreading throughout the u.s um only

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:47,920
in

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
five days there were around 100 million

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,000
visits were paid to cdc and nih websites

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,920
so we can see that the people are eager

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,280
to get that information from

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
authoritative sources

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,760
but at the same time um it has been a

32
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
challenge for users

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
uh to to evaluate the trustworthiness of

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,280
those sources

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,240
and actually at these times the number

36
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,280
of scams and

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,680
spams and whatever malicious activity

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,640
that uh

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,119
we see on the network uh um goes up

40
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,000
so um you would say wait we have uh some

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,479
protection mechanisms for that right

42
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,479
so i'm going to give you an example of

43
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,320
how it went down here in

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,759
germany where i live you can see

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,799
two websites um both have sound domain

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,000
names under the e

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,400
that's the country code top-level domain

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,520
for germany

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,880
both have https enabled uh a tech savvy

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,640
user could also verify that one of them

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,479
has dns enabled

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,520
um and the content looks

53
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
identical so there's no way that you

54
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,360
could actually differentiate these two

55
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,799
websites from each other

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,799
it's interesting to know that it was the

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,719
malicious website that has like the

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,680
heightened uh

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,240
higher security measures and had the dns

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,280
enabled

61
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,399
um and it was the website on the left

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:08,959
side

63
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,840
um that managed to defraud 4 000

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,599
applicants of uh their paycheck

65
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,599
protection plans

66
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,120
and uh the question is uh if you take

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,879
this example as the point of departure

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,200
for

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,560
for our research the question is uh

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,959
what happens what what what brings user

71
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,640
to to this point of

72
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,599
uh falling with victim to to such scams

73
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,400
so

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
we go way back to to the point that an

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
authority or an organization

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,280
whatever uh wants to go online the first

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,239
thing that they do

78
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
is they have a domain name delegated to

79
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,120
them so um

80
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,599
they have alternatives among uh the

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,239
so-called

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
um generate top-level domains that are

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,000
open

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,599
to um everyone like dotcom.org that

85
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,040
anyone can register

86
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,840
and there are also uh options uh

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,280
depending if you can fulfill

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
the requirements that are reserved for

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,519
specific uh

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,400
entities uh like.gov for governmental

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,360
organizations um

92
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
there's a difference for which domain

93
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,879
name uh there's a difference for users

94
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,599
also

95
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,720
uh which top dld you decide

96
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,800
to choose for your organizations um if

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,920
someone see that

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,959
a domain name ensure that gov they would

99
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,599
assume that you're an organization

100
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,959
entity that has

101
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
undergone some form of vetting and you

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,080
have fulfilled some requirements so

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
um it influences the the the quality of

104
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,879
the trust relation that you would

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,640
build up with that um entity

106
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,840
the next step which is technically

107
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,319
speaking

108
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,239
not required is to get a

109
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,720
certificate that can at least prove that

110
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,360
you're the

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,439
owner of the domain name these are the

112
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,360
so-called domain validation

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
certificates or at best it can prove

114
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,439
your identity

115
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,439
um the organization or extended

116
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,400
validation um domain names that uh

117
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,519
some certification authority has uh uh

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,080
went about and checked your credentials

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
have checked that your i don't know

120
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,400
company exists

121
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
your address is correct and you actually

122
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,720
exist and they vouch for the correctness

123
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,560
of that information

124
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,199
um in the last step you put the

125
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,120
certificate on your web server

126
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
you uh port your name servers to

127
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,520
your web server and on the other hand um

128
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
the users would discover your domain

129
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
name uh through email

130
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,320
newspaper social media what not um and

131
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,639
would navigate over

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,800
so um we have many components that all

133
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,199
uh come together to realize this

134
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,560
communication

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,040
uh and of course each of them has an

136
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,120
impact on on the level of

137
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,840
uh trust if if you will or the security

138
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,680
of of this communication that

139
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,919
is established at the end we are going

140
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,039
to focus on

141
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,759
three aspects one is on the top is

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,080
regards the dns and dnsec

143
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,919
uh the domain names as the starting

144
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,759
point of any communication over the

145
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,199
internet

146
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,039
yes you could use ip addresses but no

147
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,639
one does so

148
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,240
it would be the fact of the starting

149
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,759
point um it would give you an

150
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,600
identity hint depending on which

151
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,680
top-level domain you're using

152
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,800
um as i said about like uh the dot gov

153
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,639
which would um uh imply that you're an

154
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,199
um

155
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,600
governmental organization uh we talked

156
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,639
about the nsx

157
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,840
um and how it uh secures the

158
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,759
name resolution um using

159
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,160
cryptographic measures how it protects

160
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
the data origin authentication and data

161
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,039
integrity

162
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,880
and finally we uh study the the role of

163
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,440
certificates as i mentioned depending on

164
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,639
the certificate type

165
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,960
if it's an um domain validation

166
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,919
certificate

167
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,639
uh it's going to be used as a proof of

168
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,400
domain ownership

169
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,359
and if it's in

170
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,120
organization validation or extended

171
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,479
validation domain name it's going to be

172
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
used as a proof of identity so

173
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,960
if someone gets that certificate from

174
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,199
your web server they could verify who

175
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,520
you

176
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,400
are in the real world and not just on

177
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
the internet

178
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
um what we contribute in our work can be

179
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,440
summarized in three steps um

180
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
first of all we define a threat model

181
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
for web-based communication we

182
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,800
um precisely define what we consider as

183
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,919
secure

184
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,759
uh terms like security and

185
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,520
trustworthiness are maybe

186
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,199
too vague so we clearly define what we

187
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,800
are looking for

188
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,960
then we define a method to discover and

189
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,759
analyze alerting authorities in the u.s

190
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,800
um there is interestingly enough no uh

191
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,720
central repository that you could ask

192
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,759
okay give me the the url for

193
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,520
um i don't know um uh

194
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,840
uh a fire department in in in orange

195
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,560
county um

196
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,360
and at the end uh we put these two steps

197
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,000
together

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,880
and we um investigate what we call the

199
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,240
security profiles

200
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,680
of alerting authorities um in the u.s

201
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,639
so starting with our thread model uh we

202
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,199
define

203
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,520
security on three dimensions the first

204
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
one is identification

205
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,680
you should be able to know uh with whom

206
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
you're communicating so you can

207
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,280
decide what type of trust relation you

208
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
want to build with them

209
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,319
um it's of course interesting in such

210
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,520
critical situations not necessarily

211
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,800
for um i don't know watching cat videos

212
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
on the internet

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,080
um the next dimension is resolution that

214
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,800
if you have found a domain name that you

215
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,280
think

216
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,319
is your target your goal um

217
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,840
it should uh be make sure that

218
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,879
that domain name is securely

219
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,080
resolved to the actual web server and

220
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,560
not

221
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,080
to some malicious one and finally

222
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,960
if everything goes well the transaction

223
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,879
the actual data exchange

224
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,000
should be secured the data should not be

225
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
altered

226
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,000
it should not leak your privacy and so

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,879
on

228
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,160
so i explained

229
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,560
components of web communication now we

230
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,759
have the threat model

231
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,560
the question is how can those components

232
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
amount to

233
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,039
realize a secure communication

234
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,320
that matches our threat model so let's

235
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
see um

236
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
i'm going to go through a couple of

237
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,320
examples to uh

238
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,799
to show in an anecdotal way uh what we

239
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,919
mean um

240
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,360
uh by security and our third model so um

241
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
it is all in the context of what we call

242
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,959
assurance profiles

243
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,160
uh as an example i took cdc.gov

244
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,399
the gov domain name is a restricted tld

245
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,600
so you would know

246
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,720
governmental organization check um

247
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,760
they have dns enabled uh

248
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,560
you know resolution is uh secure check

249
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
and they at the end if you

250
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,440
um establish a connection with the web

251
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,399
server

252
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,640
they're going to provide you with an

253
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,480
organization validation certificate

254
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
which would act as a proof of identity

255
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,279
so identification resolution transaction

256
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,279
check we call this a strong assurance

257
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,480
profile

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,680
the next one um bernco

259
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,800
it's a county uh that has the

260
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,080
similar uh profile as cdc

261
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,360
but it only provides a domain validation

262
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,760
certificate so it cannot be used for

263
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,279
um as a proof of identity um

264
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,080
so uh you would know okay it's it's

265
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,440
actually okay

266
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,959
it's definitely a county it's a

267
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,680
governmental organization

268
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,000
but you wouldn't have any more

269
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
information that you could uniquely

270
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,040
identify who is behind that website so

271
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,360
identification is not that good

272
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
resolution is okay because they have the

273
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
nsx enabled and

274
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,040
uh transaction is also good because you

275
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,200
can use the certificate

276
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,399
over uh ssltls to exchange keys and

277
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,360
secure the

278
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,240
data exchange the transaction we call

279
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,279
this kind of setting a

280
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,560
weak assurance um another example of

281
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,760
weak assurance is

282
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,440
uh the usps.com uh

283
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
as you know the the the postal service

284
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,959
is also part of the critical

285
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,320
infrastructure if you

286
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,079
think about the um the elections and the

287
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,279
role that they are playing

288
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,480
it also becomes clear um interestingly

289
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
enough usps.com is under a

290
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
non-restricted top-level domain name

291
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,640
so uh it means that anyone uh

292
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
could try to spoof the name because

293
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,959
registering a domain name under dot com

294
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,720
is actually as easy as

295
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,279
anything else um they don't have the nsa

296
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,640
enabled so

297
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,000
um they're open for uh not only

298
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,959
uh resolution attacks but uh attacks

299
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,000
that also

300
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,160
uh regard the domain validation

301
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
certificate so i'm gonna get back to

302
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,640
that later

303
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,680
um and at the end if everything

304
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,720
goes well if the resolution is not

305
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,600
compromised and you land at the

306
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
uh authentic web server of the usps at

307
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,519
least they provide an

308
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,560
uh ov or ev certificate that can be as

309
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,160
um can can act as an um

310
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,480
definitive proof of identity so

311
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,399
identification in this sense is

312
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,120
incremental if everything

313
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
before that goes well you can't identify

314
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,480
uh um

315
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,000
uniquely the resolution is not secured

316
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
because they don't have the nsx

317
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,839
and the transaction is okay they have

318
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,760
the certificate

319
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,800
that can be used to um exchange keys and

320
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,040
secure the transaction um moving on um

321
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,880
this is the most insecure uh type of

322
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,399
insurance profile that we are going to

323
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,920
introduce is what we call an inadequate

324
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,560
assurance um an example is give for

325
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,639
cdc.org this is the um fundraising

326
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,600
website of

327
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
cdc foundation

328
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,079
to raise money for for not for against

329
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,000
covet

330
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,240
and interestingly enough they opt for

331
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
dot org which is a non-restricted

332
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
tld uh very easy to spoof such domain

333
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,920
names i

334
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,240
at the time that i finished the slide uh

335
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,959
i checked that g4cdc.net for example

336
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,680
is open for delegation they don't have

337
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,880
the nsx

338
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,079
well uh you know the the consequences

339
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,360
and at the end they only

340
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,839
uh provide a dv certificate so as a user

341
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,480
if you

342
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,680
go on the website and if you go through

343
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,440
the checklist of all these technical

344
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
components that i mentioned are you

345
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,959
wouldn't be able to

346
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,040
know with whom you are communicating and

347
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,120
if everything

348
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,360
is actually has succeeded as you

349
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,959
expected that

350
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,440
so um for a website that raised

351
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
more than tens of millions of dollars uh

352
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,839
it's really interesting that they have

353
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,040
something

354
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,320
some assurance profile that we um

355
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,760
categorize as inadequate so

356
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,120
um the details of of how we put that

357
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,160
together

358
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,720
uh can be seen in this table um

359
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,440
you have two columns characteristics of

360
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
dns

361
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
are you using your restricted tld do you

362
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,760
have dns enabled

363
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,800
which kind of x509 certificate are you

364
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,600
using

365
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,480
we don't get into the details of um ssl

366
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,199
we don't

367
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,040
check for cypher suits in this work um

368
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
we only concentrate on the type of

369
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,800
certificate so you have two columns

370
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,079
domain validation

371
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,079
or organization or extended validation

372
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,000
certificates

373
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,880
and we sum up we sum up the

374
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,519
implications of a specific uh

375
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,880
combination

376
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,160
uh and we also assign an assurance

377
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,040
profile to that

378
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
for example the first scroll if you have

379
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,720
restricted a tld

380
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,600
if you uh have dns sec if you have an ov

381
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,560
certificate

382
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,920
everything is good you have no

383
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,600
weaknesses you have

384
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,440
a strong insurance profile um

385
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,120
and um the rest is uh you can see that

386
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,680
what happens if some of these components

387
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,000
of some some of these characteristics

388
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,720
are not

389
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,600
optimal and what kind of weakness uh uh

390
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
is going to have that for you

391
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,399
so moving on um we're coming to the

392
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,480
point that we actually measured uh

393
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,320
real alerting authorities in the in the

394
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
us to see how they are doing

395
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,279
um to do that as i mentioned earlier

396
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
there is no central repository that you

397
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,120
can get a list of all

398
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,880
organizations involved in emergency

399
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
management

400
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,240
and have like a domain name or url uh

401
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,440
assigned to that so what we did is uh we

402
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,320
took the list of alerting authorities

403
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,120
from female

404
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,360
these are the lists of all organizations

405
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,560
that are

406
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,839
um connected to fema's alerting

407
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,720
system um it's not exhaustive in the

408
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,920
sense that it

409
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,320
it does not cover all the organizations

410
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,000
involved in emergency management but

411
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,399
it's

412
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,440
representative you could argue um we

413
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,079
went through

414
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,760
um since the list only includes the name

415
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,560
and the state

416
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,759
uh um or the territory because the

417
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,880
um not incorporated territories also uh

418
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,920
listed um we

419
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,759
go through google we give the list and

420
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,680
the territory of operation

421
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,160
and see if we can find a matching url we

422
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,759
sanitize urls uh

423
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,000
we also manually verify if that if our

424
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
system works properly

425
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
it does um and then we do the

426
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,040
domain namespace analysis we check for

427
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,920
dns sect

428
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,120
we see what kind of tles they use we

429
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,600
classify the type of organization that

430
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,199
uses this domain name

431
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,839
and parallel to that we check for active

432
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,560
certificate

433
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,480
that they're using we also check for the

434
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,079
historical certificates

435
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,639
that have been in use under that domain

436
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,079
name using their certificate

437
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,160
transparency logs

438
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,800
uh we put all that together and um

439
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,720
[Music]

440
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,079
we measure the assurance profiles for

441
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,199
each of the organizations we did that uh

442
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,800
measurement from october

443
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,199
2019 to march 2020 from different

444
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,959
vantage points in europe and in

445
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,560
in the us um many u.s

446
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,199
organizations tend to block uh traffic

447
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,880
from from from europe

448
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,959
so it was good that we did that from

449
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,720
both uh vantage points

450
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,839
uh to account for that um we started

451
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,160
with

452
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,519
uh 1388 alerting authorities from a list

453
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,880
from

454
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,079
september 2019 from fema and we mapped

455
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,079
that to

456
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,000
1365 urls uh

457
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,319
and 1327 unique hosts domain names um

458
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,000
which you you would know that

459
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,640
some organizations are sharing the same

460
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,319
domain name

461
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,720
so now we can get into the results what

462
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,000
have we found out

463
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,760
um starting with um dns and dns sec

464
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,119
uh we had three questions three general

465
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,720
questions in mind um

466
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
does each alerting authority have its

467
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,440
own dedicated domain name

468
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,679
how do they integrate in the global dns

469
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,799
namespace

470
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,080
and do they actually use dns sec

471
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,400
so if you found out that 50 percent

472
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,679
about okay

473
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,480
to be precise 49 of alerting authorities

474
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,960
do not have their dedicated names

475
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,720
which only means unnecessary

476
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,480
dependencies um

477
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,280
the x509 certificates are bound

478
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,799
practically bound to

479
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,559
uh domain names so if you don't have

480
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,200
your domain name you cannot have an

481
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,840
x509 certificates and you're reliant on

482
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
someone that

483
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,480
has a certificate to host you on their

484
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,280
day name

485
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,880
or whatever consolation that you're

486
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,919
going for um so unnecessary dependencies

487
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,919
um if you don't have dedicated domain

488
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,440
names

489
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,320
we see that more than 50 percent uh more

490
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,360
than half of the

491
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,679
unique names are under non-restricted

492
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,880
tlds

493
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,200
uh which means poor recognizability and

494
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
inferior security

495
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,440
um inferior security in a sense that um

496
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,080
for generally

497
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,799
top-level domain names it's very easy to

498
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,120
spoof those names um

499
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,160
and to register names that may sound or

500
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,120
look the same

501
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,000
but are not the same um and it was

502
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,200
really um

503
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,720
interesting because for uh

504
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,840
for every type of organization that we

505
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
investigated and that we have in our

506
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,919
list uh for public safety governmental

507
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,240
law enforcement military educational

508
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,400
there is actually at least in the u.s

509
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,760
there is actually a

510
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,440
top-level domain name or a second level

511
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,280
domain name that um

512
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,480
is restricted and is reserved for these

513
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:04,960
kind of

514
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,520
um organizations and entities and it was

515
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,280
interesting to see that people don't use

516
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,720
that

517
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,200
finally uh it might not surprise

518
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,919
everyone

519
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,520
but about uh only about four percent

520
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,760
have tnsx enabled

521
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,240
um as you can see on the bottom right

522
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,320
side um

523
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,679
the dot us locality uh

524
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,480
namespace for example ca.us which is for

525
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,320
california

526
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,760
some of those locality namespaces

527
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,120
do not even have dnsec

528
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,600
on the top level so none of the domain

529
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,720
names under them can use the nsx

530
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,799
we also saw that dot gov domain names

531
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,440
which are mandated to use dns

532
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,880
don't use dns which is very strange

533
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,080
um but the results are comparing to the

534
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,679
global trends um

535
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,720
we see a heightened security but

536
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,760
it's only four percent so it's um not

537
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,280
good

538
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,480
so moving on um

539
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
to the web pki and the analysis of of

540
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
web certificates

541
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,200
we did that on two levels uh two what

542
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,919
extents do

543
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,240
um alerting authorities adapt to a pki

544
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,120
these are the

545
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,200
active certificates that they are using

546
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,039
and then look at the past go

547
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,960
through the time machine of certificate

548
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,080
transparency

549
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,760
and see what has been changed

550
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,159
um interestingly enough we see that uh

551
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,600
in 2019 about 15

552
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,640
provide non or invalid certificates when

553
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,799
i say invalid certificate i mean

554
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,280
um the validation that is done by

555
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,200
openssl openssl um is not as permissive

556
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,919
as your browser for example if your of

557
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,840
server does not uh

558
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,159
provide the complete chain of trust uh

559
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,600
the chain of certificates

560
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,559
that you need to verify your web browser

561
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,240
might be able to fill in the missing

562
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,280
certificates and

563
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,559
pass the validation open ssl does not do

564
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,200
that so

565
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,080
there's a difference but at the same

566
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
time we also see

567
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,640
hosts that they don't even have ssl or

568
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,919
tls

569
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,760
activated which means secure

570
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,600
identification and transaction

571
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,480
is simply impossible because providing a

572
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,360
certificate

573
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,400
as a proof of identification happens

574
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,720
through the context of ssl or tls and if

575
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,679
you don't have that

576
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,799
no certificate no identification

577
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,320
then we moved through the time tunnel

578
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,960
and we have been asking ourselves uh

579
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,720
which type of validation

580
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
types for certificates have been popular

581
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,559
we see that uh

582
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,880
ov and ev certificates which play a

583
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,120
major role in our third model

584
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,120
they're losing popularity um there are

585
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
maybe some some some reasons for that uh

586
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,840
first of all browsers

587
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,200
don't care anymore about the different

588
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,559
kinds of certificates

589
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,320
they're not doing doing a good job in

590
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,640
differentiating that

591
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,640
they cost more they are uh

592
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,039
different uh certification authorities

593
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,400
that provide

594
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,520
uh domain validation certificates free

595
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,120
of charge so there are multiple

596
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
reasons for that but you can see on the

597
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,480
bottom line

598
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,799
that the ov certificates are just diving

599
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,159
down in favor of

600
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,679
tv certificates um

601
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,840
we have been asking ourselves is if the

602
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,799
certificate

603
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,000
usage has been exclusive um

604
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,280
interestingly enough um we see that

605
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,039
certificate sharing is on the rise what

606
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,159
do i mean by certificate sharing um

607
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,840
uh an x 509 certificate has a

608
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,720
field called uh subject alternative uh

609
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,520
name

610
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,320
that can list different domain names for

611
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,400
which the certificate is valid

612
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,960
uh people use wildcards you can have

613
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,840
wildcards for

614
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,600
extended validation certificates but for

615
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,000
the others people use wildcards if they

616
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,520
have different domains for the same

617
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,880
organization

618
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,080
uh it's all okay but what we mean by

619
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,440
certificate sharing is that

620
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,760
different entities actually use the same

621
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,039
certificate

622
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,080
um which leads to fate sharing if one of

623
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,559
those

624
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,600
organizations uh gets compromised every

625
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
other one has to acquire

626
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,400
a new certificate are and also are

627
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,120
at risk um there are different reasons

628
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,760
for that

629
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,679
um you can see on the uh graph on the

630
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,799
bottom line that um the number of uh

631
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,120
unique subject alternative names has

632
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,480
been rising

633
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,880
um you see a lot of domain validation

634
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,039
certificates from let's encrypt uh

635
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,679
that have up to 100 which is the limit

636
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,240
for the

637
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,400
uh let's encrypt certificates you see

638
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
service providers that have multiple

639
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,279
customers on the same infrastructure

640
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,320
for which they're using the same um uh

641
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,120
certificates

642
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,039
which is very bad practice um

643
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,039
and there might be also other reasons

644
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,080
that we have missed

645
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,120
um we also asked ourselves uh what is

646
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,360
the role of certification authorities

647
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,159
um in this whole ecosystem and we see

648
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,440
also that the ca

649
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
giants like godaddy that they provided

650
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,880
like

651
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,960
all-in-one packages are losing their

652
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,320
market share to

653
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,720
automated dv certificate issuers like uh

654
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,640
let's encrypt as you can see in the

655
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,880
graph below let's encrypt since their

656
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
inceptions they have been

657
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,320
growing um very fast um and

658
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,799
it leads us to the conclusion that

659
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,400
actually alerting authorities

660
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,559
might care more about encryption because

661
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,400
with the domain validation certificate

662
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,760
you cannot do identification um

663
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
and give less cure to identification

664
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,360
itself

665
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,000
so moving on um if you have the

666
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,360
fine-grained details

667
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,600
um now we're going to use our threat

668
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,000
model to put all that together

669
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,120
and um see from the

670
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,000
perspective of uh assurance profiles

671
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,360
that i defined

672
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,480
uh earlier in this talk um

673
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
so what do we see if we put all these

674
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,320
pieces together we see that only about

675
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,360
22 percent

676
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,760
exhibit strong or weak insurance

677
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,400
profiles

678
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,679
only two percent provide um strong

679
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,720
insurance profiles

680
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,799
uh which is not not not that good

681
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,200
um specifically for for governmental

682
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,400
organizations that

683
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
they should have the resources to have

684
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,080
that kind of insurance profiles

685
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,679
um among those who have inadequate

686
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,799
uh assurance profiles which amounts to

687
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,559
67 percent

688
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,600
um we see that uh mostly it's because of

689
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,799
a combination of

690
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,600
lack of dns combined with db

691
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,720
certificates

692
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,159
um this is one thing that i wanted to

693
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,400
mention earlier if you don't have

694
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,200
dns sec there are specific types of

695
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,240
attack

696
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,159
that can cause certificate miss issuance

697
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,480
uh specifically for domain validation

698
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,520
certificates

699
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,919
because those certification authorities

700
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,919
use automated um

701
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,960
uh procedures which heavily rely

702
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,360
on on on proper resolution of

703
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,200
dns and if your dns is not

704
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,400
properly secured there's a chance

705
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
they're doing their best not to allow

706
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,080
such kind of attacks

707
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
but there's a chance that uh you can

708
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,480
cause the certification authority to

709
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,440
issue a

710
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,120
certificate for a domain name that you

711
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,279
do not own um

712
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,400
so it's something um that the dnsx also

713
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,279
impacts the

714
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,240
uh security of

715
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,000
x509 certificates uh moving on you can

716
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
hear in the highlighted part see the 15

717
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
percent that i mentioned earlier that

718
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,120
provide to to um that failed to provide

719
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,440
valid certificates at all

720
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,200
um so 78 total of uh

721
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,840
inadequate uh weak insurance inadequate

722
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,960
uh profiles is

723
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,279
actually not a good number for critical

724
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,200
infrastructure

725
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,200
um so what can you do

726
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,440
if you recall the threat model that i

727
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,480
mentioned

728
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,480
before um the

729
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,919
solution is not that complicated you

730
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,720
first need need to choose uh securely

731
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
delegated domain names

732
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,720
meaning that the domain name that you're

733
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,080
using should be

734
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,520
have dns enabled

735
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,360
under restricted tlds depending on which

736
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,840
field of operation you're involved in

737
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,919
and use ov or ev certificates

738
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,840
best combination makes affiliations

739
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,080
recognizable and proves identity

740
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,279
the next one is okay at least enable dns

741
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:49,679
sec

742
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,120
so that the name resolution is uh secure

743
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,080
and you avoid possible mis-issuance of

744
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,320
domain validation certificates

745
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,120
um if you cannot use ov or ev

746
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,919
certificates

747
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,840
at least you could use dain ee

748
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,360
certificates um

749
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
semantically they are the same as tv

750
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,480
certificates

751
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,799
but you have the sole control over that

752
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,320
so

753
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,159
another certificate certification

754
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,919
authority cannot issue a certificate

755
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,279
under your name because you have the

756
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,799
control over your

757
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,000
name servers i know

758
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,799
uh similar to to the case of browsers

759
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,880
ignoring different kinds of certificates

760
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,399
um browsers also ignore tlsa glsa

761
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,840
entries uh in dns and also danny but

762
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
here we only focus on the technical

763
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
solutions that we have at hand and we

764
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,159
consider how we can combine that

765
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,600
to enable um secure uh communication

766
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,080
moving on uh use dedicated domain names

767
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,840
and certificates

768
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,960
makes sense um avoids uh fate sharing so

769
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,440
if

770
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,799
someone uh gets compromised you're safe

771
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,640
at least

772
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,679
um if you're interested to see our data

773
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,640
our raw data

774
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,840
our statistics uh our process data

775
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,240
you want to know more details uh head to

776
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,880
aa.signnow.net

777
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,559
you can see the list of all the alerting

778
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,600
authorities that we um

779
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,240
investigated and you can see the the

780
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
their assurance profiles um

781
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,480
and the details of why we classified

782
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,760
that as such

783
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,880
uh you can also find our tool chain our

784
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,520
data

785
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,760
everything else on zenodo it's also

786
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,600
linked on the website

787
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,000
um we contacted the alerting authorities

788
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,840
we informed them of uh

789
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,600
of um of our research and and the

790
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,200
assurance profiles that we assigned to

791
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,000
them

792
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,919
positive or negative if you have any

793
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,080
questions if you have any critique or if

794
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,279
you want to work with us

795
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,799
you can drop me a line at pft acm.org

796
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,600
and now i take any questions that you

797
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,320
might have

798
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,720
or any comments that you want to share

799
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,520
with me

800
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,840
thank you

801
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,240
boyan uh thank you again for presenting

802
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,760
and for joining us for this

803
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,000
q a here welcome the first question we

804
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,200
have from our communities

805
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,200
is um hasn't some of uh the groups uh

806
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,279
like let's encrypt had their root

807
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,440
certificates compromised or removed

808
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,640
from trusted certificate authorities

809
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,480
status by various groups

810
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,679
um not that i know

811
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,600
our focus was was on web-based uh

812
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,200
communication because i mean you can

813
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
also have let's encrypt certificates for

814
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
your mail server

815
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,000
um i don't know um

816
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,120
for for other fields of operation but

817
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,480
for web

818
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,520
web browsers i'm not i haven't heard of

819
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,799
any of the

820
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,159
giants like chrome firefox or others

821
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,760
to have that removed but i can't

822
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,600
understand that if someone wants to

823
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,360
have it removed got it

824
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,559
um thank you again this was uh

825
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,320
enormous amount of work this is a very

826
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,240
much an in-depth study and uh

827
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,200
at the very end you uh kind of came up

828
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,919
with a list of uh recommendations

829
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,720
and um are there anything uh you

830
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,919
audition in addition you would like to

831
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,679
share with our community

832
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,480
um um based on uh all this work

833
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,039
um i think one of the um beside

834
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,960
everything that i mentioned in in

835
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,200
in this paper one of the biggest

836
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,000
challenges that

837
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,799
that we are going to have um are the

838
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,440
browser

839
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,720
vendors themselves because they have um

840
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,000
a very specific some kind of hardwired

841
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,039
idea of what is secure and

842
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,360
they try i mean they um

843
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,919
take over that that that that decision

844
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,279
from the

845
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,559
users to themselves and like uh

846
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,200
googles of this world um always believe

847
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,039
that trust us we know what's good for

848
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,480
you and the rest is

849
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,600
uh and not your problem uh

850
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,399
just one example um at some point

851
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,000
browsers uh remove

852
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,679
the discrimination between different

853
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,080
kinds of uh certificates so

854
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,840
if you look at your browser now you only

855
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,120
see the padlock

856
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,760
um you don't see who issues that you

857
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,480
don't see if

858
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,159
it's a domain validation or your

859
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,320
extended or organization validation

860
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,120
certificate um which was really helpful

861
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,000
they argued that

862
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,799
users don't understand the difference i

863
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,360
argue

864
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,960
that they did a bad job in

865
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,120
educating users the difference between

866
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,080
uh

867
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,919
different certificates so i think that

868
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,159
is uh one point that that needs more

869
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,240
more more research and more work

870
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,720
okay well uh very good and uh

871
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,679
one last question is on uh you mentioned

872
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,399
that only

873
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,960
fifty percent of the alerting

874
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,440
authorities have the dedicated domain

875
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,799
uh do you think it's just a matter of

876
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,480
educating uh

877
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,840
uh folks to um and

878
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,440
to make sure they understand that is a

879
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,679
best practice to have a dedicated domain

880
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,799
is that where we stand at this point

881
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,000
um i think that would be

882
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,799
uh that that's a very good question um

883
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,159
and it's really hard to answer

884
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,080
i think that that is uh partly due to

885
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,440
educating um users and and on dedicated

886
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,880
domain names but i think

887
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,080
partly or even mainly it's because

888
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,039
that of the resources are missing for

889
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,880
critical infrastructure it was

890
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,320
really interesting to see like um

891
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
police departments fire departments

892
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,559
everything that you really rely on

893
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,279
during disasters emergencies and so on

894
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,240
and they have really bad infrastructure

895
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,000
um i had a couple of screenshots uh

896
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,640
to show but um we don't have time for

897
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,039
that

898
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,360
that you can see as if like it was the

899
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,880
early 90s

900
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,960
that they designed the website and it's

901
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
over there so i think it's a question of

902
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,320
also resources that

903
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,280
okay if if the state or county can can

904
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,960
host my my

905
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,000
stuff then i'm okay with that i don't

906
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,918
need to take care of my domain name and

907
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,159
my web server and so on so far

908
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,280
that would be my speculation

909
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,560
i understand uh poryan again thanks so

910
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,440
much for joining us

911

912
