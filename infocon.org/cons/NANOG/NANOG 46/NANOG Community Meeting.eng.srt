162
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,440
at the size anyway we're gonna we're

163
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:11,750
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address the typeface issues as</font>

164

a sort of number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one priority in the</font>

165
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,560
near future so I don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear any</font>

166
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,349
complaints about that although

167
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,000
complaints about other things um so the

168
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:23,030
program committee are the group of

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,340
people who solicit recruit<font color="#E5E5E5"> help shape</font>

171
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,210
the nan on conferences so that means if

172
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,130
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the agenda you think it</font>

173
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,539
sucks that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably our fault and if</font>

174
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,360
you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you think it's</font>

175
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,539

176
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,399
of the credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that so here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

people who are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program committee</font>

178
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,250
the program committee is the largest

179
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,899
group of sort of elected or selected of

180
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,250
people in nanna governance and that's

181
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:50,600
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of work to do a</font>

means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something happened bad at</font>

190
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,070
registration and maybe you should be on

191
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,779
the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't and it could be fate</font>

192
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,640
I don't know I don't comment on that

193
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,079
well with like you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

194
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,290
drafted into the program committee and

195
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,640
not notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this if that is true</font>

196
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,099
please note that we have quite a few

197
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">calls and we'll be contacting you to let</font>

198
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,880
you know when those are can program

199
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,320
committee members in the room stand up

200
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,570
for just a second just so somebody can

201
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,660
cast an evil eye<font color="#CCCCCC"> on you and find you as</font>

202
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,279
I said there's a lot of us if you have a

203
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,399
talk that you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give thank</font>

204
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,160
you all or if you have some feedback

205
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,420
you'd like or you just have an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

206
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,520
something that you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see at the</font>

207
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,860
conference come see one of the people

208
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,040
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saw stand up we work pretty</font>

209
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,399
hard on this and we want your feedback

210
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,370
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandatory slide on stats we</font>

211
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:55,750
accepted right around fifty percent of

212
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,829
all of the talks that we submitted so

213
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,390
you can look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say if you</font>

214
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:00,800
submit a talk there's you know fifty

215
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,540
percent chance that it's not going to

216
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">get through and be selected you can say</font>

217
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,329
like for a conference that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

218
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:07,400
competitive selection that's actually a

219
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:09,439
pretty easy conference to get a talk

220
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,390
accepted and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you that the P</font>

221
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,130
most likely to get their talks accepted

222
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">are people who have real world</font>

223
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,330
experience actually doing something and

224
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,880
something interesting to say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

225
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,950
we get a lot of talks from all of your

226
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,480
marketing organizations and sometimes

227
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not bad like there are actually</font>

228
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,170
good technical talks coming out of some

229
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,820
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your marketing organizations but</font>

230
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,680
there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of fluff too and</font>

231
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,540
the fluff is probably not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

232
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,510
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do our jobs the fluff isn't going</font>

233
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,490
to get selected so there were four talks

234
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,870
withdrawn and seven pending those are

235
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,660
people who just never really got around

236
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,640
to submitting slides or never really got

237
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,380
around to you know actually getting

238
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">their talk completely submitted and we</font>

239
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,270
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> even consider those we</font>

240
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,340
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only declined 13 out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the 50</font>

241
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,870
talks some of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> were that the</font>

242
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,850
material we thought had<font color="#E5E5E5"> been covered</font>

243
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,920
recently by some other talk or by I talk

244
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,330
from similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> people sometimes that we</font>

245
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,040
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't topical or it wasn't</font>

246
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">new sometimes we just thought it wasn't</font>

247
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,939
either it was insufficiently technical

248
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,650
for this audience or it wasn't technical

249
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,510
in the right way for this audience so

250
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,709
sometimes we get those and you know

251
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,480
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not bad some of them are</font>

252
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,170
fantastic talks for some other

253
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,730
conference and you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry there's</font>

254
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,990
some changes coming up on the program

255
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,150
committee I just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let the</font>

256
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,250
community know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ren provo where's</font>

262
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,069
those people Ren povo has been there

two of them before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to go away</font>

289
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buzz off and do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something else</font>

290
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">before you come back because we want</font>

291
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,400
constant change and actually the

292
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,260
steering committee has consistently

293
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,720
turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> people over at an even higher</font>

294
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,520
rate than that because we want the

295
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,380
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program company shapes the</font>

296
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,210
content of the conference in a really

297
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,850
important way and we don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

298
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:04,250
get too stodgy and tuesdays so there's

299
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,500
turnover and after four years you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

300
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,940
go and probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> sooner than that and so</font>

301
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">ran and I our guy thanks Mike that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

302
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,710
good point so the pc is the pc is open

303
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,270
active and deep in talent and there's a

304
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,220
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here who did a lot of work</font>

305
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,980
and it's not really primarily about ren

306
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,560
or me and their new spots opening up in

307
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">october so if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you can do a</font>

308
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">better job cuz right look I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we are</font>

309
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,030
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a room that's like 80</font>

310
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,250
three-point-six percent full of

311
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,569
egomaniacal freaks right so reality is

312
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,980
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in your chair you</font>

313
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,680
probably think you can do a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

314
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,300
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did and if that's true</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then step</font>

315
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,339
up to the plate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do a better job i</font>

316
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,920
mean i'd be happy to see it that's fine

317
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:42,170
so consider serving so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

318
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,000
submission process this is by way of

319
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,410
introducing Dave Meyer we have gotten a

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,240
number of complaints some of them

321
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,100
legitimate and some of them not but

322
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,690
people who are a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit confused</font>

323
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how do you submit a talk how do</font>

324
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get it accepted what are the steps</font>

325
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,150
what's the process people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

326
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the requirements for good talks are</font>

327
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,480
always clear so as the program committee

328
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,820
we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together the following</font>

329
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,560
presentation how to successfully submit

330
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:17,060
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ana talk and Dave Myers going to give</font>

332
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,910
thanks Todd hey I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know it's</font>

333
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,020
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be at nanog it's great to see</font>

334
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,270
all of you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think we really</font>

335
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,290
should give<font color="#CCCCCC"> todd and i ran a round of</font>

336
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,380
applause because they've done a

337
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,569
fantastic job I'm just organizing nanog

338
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,520
and making

339
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:34,430
really making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happen right I mean the</font>

340
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,860
program committee works hard but I think

341
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,599
without Todd's slave driving abilities

342
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,420
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrens organizational skills it would</font>

343
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,430
be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> different so okay so this is</font>

344
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,540
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a talk at nanog and</font>

345
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,489
we'll go through this pretty quickly and

346
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">this covers panels buffs and lightning</font>

347
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:52,040
talks and all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so my agenda</font>

348
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:55,220
for this is you know what should be in

349
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,860
which should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a proposal how does</font>

350
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,330
the program committee evaluate talks

351
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,500
what are the important dates and any

352
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:04,190
other questions you guys might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

353
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one other thing is that like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

354
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,860
want to reinforce what Todd said if you

355
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">have somebody if you have an idea for a</font>

356
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,490
talk please submit it I mean there's

357
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,860
there's a lot of good<font color="#E5E5E5"> content out there</font>

358
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,680
but we can always<font color="#CCCCCC"> use people's insights</font>

359
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,920
and experiences to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inform the</font>

360
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,959
rest of the community so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

361
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,760
here it is in a nutshell basically for a

362
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,520
talk what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do for your</font>

363
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,380
proposal is give us an abstract and at

364
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,210
least an outline of the slides you plan

365
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,650
to present part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem we have a</font>

366
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,900
lot of times people give us like a

367
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,430
paragraph<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no slides and then we're</font>

368
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,370
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to evaluate well what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

369
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,050
and we'd really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to have slides and</font>

370
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:43,070
to be the really successful presenters

371
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:44,240
actually get us enough content so we can

372
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,550
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what they want to</font>

373
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,950
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

374
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we want to keep the quality up</font>

375
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:53,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">for panels we've kind of gone a little</font>

376
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,250
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> softer we just did we we generally</font>

377
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">will accept an abstract and a list of</font>

378
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,209
the panelists<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we're trying to get</font>

379
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">an idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what you want to do what what</font>

380
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,550
the shape of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its going to be you don't</font>

381
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to give us precise information</font>

382
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,859
especially for a panel because those

383
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:09,890
come together<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit less a little</font>

384
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit less formally and then in the case</font>

385
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,900
of these buffs um that are I think Joe

386
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:18,709
was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a new idea</font>

387
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:20,510
they have very less formal requirements

388
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:22,010
generally signing up or an abstract or

389
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,800
something like that is good enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

390
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,670
then in the case of lightning talks I

391
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,949
don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have</font>

392
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:36,370
submitted a talk or a lightning talk for

393
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:38,600
Nana out here ever ever what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

394
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,870
fifteen percent

395
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,079
yeah yeah so you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it I I</font>

396
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,540
encourage you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it but anyway for</font>

397
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:49,729
lightning talks like box it's quite a

398
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,800
bit less formal and an abstract is

399
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:56,899
generally sufficient let's see my sled

400
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:03,769
got broken what is this what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of mac</font>

401
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:05,030
is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we have this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PC evaluate</font>

402
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,349
we have this evaluation tool that I

403
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,839
think was originally written by Steve

404
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:11,030
and hacked on bi-rads and others<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps</font>

405
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:13,698
and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we do is we rate</font>

406
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything from one to five and you oh I</font>

407
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:19,069
guess you can do none which is not zero

408
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:20,869
it just abstain and it's kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

409
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:24,199
tool it allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write comments in</font>

410
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:25,760
it for us as PC members to kind of talk

411
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,679
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we thought was good or bad or</font>

412
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,919
important or not import with the talk

413
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,570
and it also allows the pc member to kind

414
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:35,240
of add some comments for the author so

415
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,220
in the event that you wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help the</font>

416
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,809
author improve the talk that that comes

417
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:43,669
out with the acceptance or rejection

418
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:45,168
notice and during the during the pc

419
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:46,730
members of during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings we</font>

420
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:49,940
generally discuss the merits of the

421
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,409
proposals pretty vigorously and we're

422
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">really trying to get the best quality we</font>

423
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:56,270
can for the conference and get the best

424
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:58,039
overall agenda so a lot of times sort of

425
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,539
the flow of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire conference is</font>

426
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:02,539
considered so that's another thing

427
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:04,129
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of informal but basically</font>

428
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:07,400
the way it works out is talks with

429
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,350
slides to get a mean rating of greater

430
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">than four we just almost generally</font>

431
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,059
accept and those with lower ratings are

432
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,530
discussed in and are accepted on an ad

433
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,020
hoc basis depending on the structure

434
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:20,418
that how the agenda is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> along and</font>

435
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:23,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it looks like and we also have a</font>

436
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:25,159
way of conditionally accepting a talk if

437
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,600
the content is interesting but you know

438
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,929
perhaps you didn't get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides</font>

439
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,490
together that happens a lot so we have

440
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:35,690
those kind of three categories we try to

441
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:37,400
put things<font color="#E5E5E5"> into well if you get less</font>

442
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,710
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> three you generally get rejected</font>

443
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,299
not always but generally and then we

444
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,039
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow a similar process for the</font>

445
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">boss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spanos and lightning talks so</font>

446
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,299
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have this tool we rate we</font>

447
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,429
rate the talks we get together on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

448
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:51,360
conference call we look at the ratings

449
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,980
and then we select them

450
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,049
the ones we're going to do and we try to

451
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,370
again one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might not be clear</font>

452
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:58,950
is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really try to make the entire</font>

453
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,899
agenda flow so that there's sometimes we

454
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:04,110
wind up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the topical agenda and</font>

455
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,600
other times we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't so there's a few</font>

456
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,870
important dates<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of this and this</font>

457
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit now this dis ledger old</font>

458
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,590
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ren give me an update to this</font>

459
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,709
one basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a call for</font>

460
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,629
proposals or call for presentations

461
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,040
that's we like to have it like three

462
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,870
months before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting date because</font>

463
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,730
that gives you a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and then</font>

464
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,159
we'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the initial proposals</font>

465
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,360
kind of right away<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that and again</font>

466
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,790
since they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

467
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,199
detailed if we get them very soon then

468
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,240
we can kind of start looking on what the

469
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,760
agenda is going to look like and it's

470
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,290
also important if we can get a good

471
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,850
handle on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of content we're</font>

472
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,918
going to be have especially if it's

473
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,540
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be topical I'm oriented like we</font>

474
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,950
might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might wind up with an ipv6</font>

475
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,110
oriented one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that</font>

476
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,030
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had that happen and then we try to</font>

477
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,689
know to notify people as early as

478
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:53,160
possible when they're accepted<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so</font>

479
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,600
you can book your travel and do all the

480
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,370
kind of logistical things you have to do

481
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,379
and then we like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the draft agenda</font>

482
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,520
publishes you know it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great if we</font>

483
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,010
could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out two months before</font>

484
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,639
because then you could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

485
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:08,070
travel people about it and evaluate all

486
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that stuff so if we could stand this</font>

487
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,470
flow it would really be good we haven't

488
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">been able to really do that in my time</font>

489
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:21,000
this time around but we make a pretty

490
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:22,710
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort and generally speaker final</font>

491
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,179
speaker materials are required about six

492
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,400
weeks before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting date that's I</font>

493
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,590
mean that's early but we're trying to

494
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,299
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get on the sort of you</font>

495
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,178
got it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to provide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us with a</font>

496
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,860
professional talk and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

497
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,059
conferences like if I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

498
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,350
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give toxic</font>

499
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:39,510
conferences but six weeks is an

500
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,830
outrageous and we get the agenda out a

501
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,629
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> months before the meeting</font>

502
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,610
again so you can you can get your travel

503
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,520
together and then we generally open the

504
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,899
lightning rounds the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lightning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talks for</font>

505
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,460
the first round anyway about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a month</font>

506
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,990
before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting so we have them all</font>

507
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,690
set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones anyway and</font>

508
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:57,660
then there's a there's a site here that

509
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:00,960
on where you can see where the call for

510
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,150
presentations is on the nanog site<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

511
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,800
that's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can answer any questions</font>

512
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:12,570
for anybody on how this works

513
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:14,129
pretty straightforward<font color="#E5E5E5"> a oh you got it</font>

514
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you got to slip some cash to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Patrick</font>

515
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:21,930
apparently that's where you sell me up

516
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:23,550
here question yes I noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

517
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:27,410
agenda this time there is these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

518
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,409
called tracks to explain that please

519
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,880
yeah yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we try to do the</font>

520
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,580
track what we were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is we're</font>

521
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,140
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are</font>

522
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,120
topical things that are organized in a

523
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,130
certain way so we wanted to get all

524
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,929
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are related into the same</font>

525
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:47,730
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of same kind of flow without kind</font>

526
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,430
of doing multi-tracking right<font color="#CCCCCC"> as if we</font>

527
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:53,310
could avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so tracks are like what</font>

528
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:55,110
we used to call box more or less yeah I

529
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,909
have a comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that so we used to</font>

530
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,500
have things called buffs that started

531
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,290
off a little bit ad hoc and became

532
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,720
excessively formal and it's not it it's

533
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:06,570
not bad but we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done two things this</font>

534
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,640
time one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a group of a group</font>

535
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:10,740
of breakout sessions that are somehow

536
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,240
related that are approved<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the program</font>

537
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,730
committee in advance we're going to

538
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,710
start using the term track to refer to

539
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and we're going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to a</font>

540
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,420
more traditional meaning of birds of a

541
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:23,160
feather session which is what day was

542
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,810
talking about which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is downstairs we</font>

543
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,550
have a board up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is incredibly</font>

544
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,080
primitive and experimental but we're

545
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,330
interested in seeing how you all respond

546
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,159
to it if you have an idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

547
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,840
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to talk about in a room with</font>

548
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,520
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

549
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,020
that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide the rooms</font>

550
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're going to provide the basis for</font>

551
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,350
you guys to find each other so there's a

552
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,630
board downstairs there's already a

553
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,399
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas up on it go look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if</font>

554
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,560
you're interested sign up on it we're

555
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have them out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here eventually</font>

556
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,399
and and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through and</font>

557
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">pick the ones that are most popular and</font>

558
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,210
assign rooms for them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Tuesday</font>

559
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,620
evening then they're going to have rooms

560
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,630
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

561
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,699
whatever it is that are the you know

562
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:02,100
three most popular ideas and they'll be

563
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,660
determined mostly by you so unless

564
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's something wildly inappropriate</font>

565
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,760
or silly it's going to be whatever you

566
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys want and those were going to go</font>

567
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,840
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> calling coughs so the tracks are</font>

568
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit more formal and if that</font>

I am the only one here so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel</font>

587
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:22,310
the need to raise any mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

issues you're gonna have to track me

589
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:33,010
down so what we do pretty simple we've

590
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:37,280
got an AUP we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying very hard to</font>

591
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:39,410
honor the spirit of the AUP and we're

592
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,320
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to enforce it to the letter</font>

593
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:44,270
to a certain extent the community does

594
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,179
regulate itself and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

595
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:50,270
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of you when you're posting</font>

596
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:53,660
to the list to try to keep everybody

597
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:56,540
else on track we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

598
00:24:53,660 --> 00:25:02,780
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our hands in there nobody likes it</font>

599
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:08,659
it feels it's not good we're not sensors

600
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:11,300
so if you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get details on the</font>

less than a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people think we do</font>

thousand subscribers up to 10,000 so

642
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,989

the Nano marketing group is essentially

nanog is a nice little conference with a

676
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,790
few hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and attend</font>

678
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,750
conference better and as time goes on

679
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,209
things get more expensive as everybody

680
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,290
knows and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ways we look at is</font>

681
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,510
of course to<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise the fees and we're</font>

00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,620
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that so what we're</font>

683
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,510
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is find other ways to</font>

practically nothing although<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

709
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:35,100
technically the chair<font color="#E5E5E5"> i tried really</font>

710
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:39,690
hard to give that away<font color="#CCCCCC"> and nobody wanted</font>

711
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:42,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so first of all we'd like to propose</font>

712
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,160
a possible new name we've asked for

713
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,389
people to help with marketing group in

714
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:50,820
three one two three people volunteer to

715
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:54,900
join that was it three out of the you

716
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,460
know 10,000 people and nanog so we think

717
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's possible that people are allergic</font>

718
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the technical sense i</font>

719
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,440
mean they break out in hives and start

720
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,090
sneezing when they think about marketing

721
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,350
so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the name</font>

722
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:08,580
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not marketing per se I mean</font>

723
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,379
it's kind of marketing but then what

724
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,510
really isn't

725
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,000
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sylvie suggested possibly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nano</font>

726
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">sponsorship and I'm opening it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

727
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,020
guys somebody suggest a better name and

728
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,540
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you suggest something we</font>

729
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">will ask you to join the group too so</font>

730
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,840
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let that stop you from suggesting</font>

731
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,170
a name because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to join</font>

732
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,659
the group the group isn't relatively new

733
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:32,240
but we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done a few things hopefully</font>

750
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,870

revenue into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nanog and not bother</font>

the attendees or you know be too

753
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:19,040
in-your-face about the fact that it's a

754
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,960
sponsorship deal we're also looking at

755
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">low-cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sponsorship deals we noticed</font>

00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,660
thousands and thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars and</font>

759
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,430
there's some people that may want to

help<font color="#E5E5E5"> contribute it to lower and so we're</font>

761
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,700
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some ways to do that we</font>

762
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,020
changed the web page and there were

763
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,340
actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few other things here but I</font>

764
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,020
sent it out to the marketing group and

765
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,879
nobody replied with anything so I never

766
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">updated the slide but if you notice</font>

767
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything new that was all last we did it</font>

768
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,620
all if it was good if<font color="#CCCCCC"> not then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

769
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:54,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">know Joe or Chris or somebody did it</font>

770
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:57,620
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because she so did</font>

771
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:59,030
I skip a slide there was another<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

772
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,429
in here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if I deleted it or</font>

773
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,530
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it got lost in the shuffle we have</font>

774
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,900
some new ideas for nan dogs coming up

775
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,520
and instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of boring you all with them</font>

776
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,890
what I'm going to say is if you guys

777
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,420
have any ideas of ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can make</font>

778
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,790
down are better and get some more

779
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,380
sponsorship deals in then you should

780
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,280
email the sponsorship group and of

781
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,450
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to join</font>

782
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,220
the group<font color="#CCCCCC"> for which case you can just</font>

783
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:23,520
say no but still<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail the ideas</font>

784
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:25,560
so call went out for volunteers this is

785
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,660
where I said you know three people

786
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,740
volunteered and I by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that's my</font>

787
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,180
fault that I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten back to all</font>

788
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,650
of them so I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're sitting</font>

789
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this room going I already volunteered</font>

790
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,660
but if you haven't volunteered now is

791
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,840
the time who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help raise your</font>

792
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:42,690
hand no no no really oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god Martin</font>

795
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:56,070
just wondering well one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin is worth</font>

796
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:59,120
like three Me's so yes get hit him<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

797
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:03,270
oh now there's ideas for down on 47 and

798
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:07,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> marîd update Oh any last</font>

799
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:10,500
questions well actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only had one</font>

800
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:14,540
on the slide we have a demo room there's

801
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,770
actually several ideas the working group

802
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,880
shockingly suffers from the fact that we

803
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:22,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">all have day jobs and we're all very</font>

804
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:24,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">busy as you should well no just a little</font>

805
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,800
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the things that we</font>

806
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:29,580
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about was we have the beer and</font>

807
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,320
gear<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're eight or ten or 45 vendors</font>

808
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,389
come in and they present gear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

809
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,100
get to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> them for two hours or</font>

810
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,319
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that or maybe it's three</font>

811
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,790
I forget and what we thought about is

812
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,750
creating a room off to the side where

813
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,820
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could set up their gear and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

814
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,690
could go in and get one-on-one or see

815
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,850
just their gear and that would be

816
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">available during you know a large</font>

817
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,880
portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the conference whether that's</font>

818
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:50,069
like the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing or maybe on monday</font>

819
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,350
or you know whatever and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

820
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,060
of course a more expensive sponsorship

821
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,139
deal and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be not in your face</font>

822
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,549
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not sitting up here in</font>

823
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:58,710
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the plenary or anything like</font>

824
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:01,560
that but a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people want to go in</font>

825
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:03,600
and put hands on the equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

826
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,549
know talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors in great detail</font>

827
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,500
when they have real technicians their

828
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,030
you know their highest food people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

829
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,530
stuff like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seemed like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

830
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,940
idea and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually tried to do that</font>

831
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this conference but we just couldn't</font>

832
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,690
get it ready in time so we're going to

833
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,580
try that for next there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other ideas</font>

834
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:21,360
too if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any please forward</font>

835
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:23,670
yours Oh bill oh my god an idea no I

836
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,340
didn't have an idea Patrick<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I was</font>

837
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:28,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of curious if you could just wax</font>

838
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,390
poetic for a minute or two about

839
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,339
what you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I ought to try and</font>

840
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:35,950
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if you're looking for more</font>

841
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:38,799
sponsorship opportunities but you've

842
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,299
created a wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says we don't want</font>

843
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:43,509
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become a commercial trade show</font>

844
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:45,369
then maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

845
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,700
should become that's not a commercial

846
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:50,079
trade show for example if you believe

847
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,700
you can have a demo room if you want to

848
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,799
demonstrate interoperability like the

849
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,259
old interrupts used to be or maybe you

850
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:59,440
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know migrate towards more of</font>

851
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:01,660
an operational think tank type of thing

852
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what are the sort of directions</font>

853
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,038
that you're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like to direct</font>

854
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:08,200
nanog to go in and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> market</font>

855
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:10,359
towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> that direction these are all</font>

856
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,740
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good ideas but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not for the</font>

857
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:13,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group the marketing working</font>

858
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:16,328
group or sponsorship group<font color="#CCCCCC"> today to deal</font>

859
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:18,160
with we are very clearly charged where

860
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:20,410
we as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I came up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this partially on</font>

861
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,819
my own but this is really what we are

862
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,910
designed to do is keep the conference as

863
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:27,009
it is now and how the SC and the pc and

864
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,980
the community in<font color="#CCCCCC"> general wants it to be</font>

865
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:31,720
so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to change the conference</font>

866
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a fine idea but that's really</font>

867
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,259
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the purview of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> marketing</font>

868
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,700
working group we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep it</font>

869
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,770
the way it is or the way it's been

870
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:42,759
decided to be by the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

871
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the Nano 46 meeting page and you look</font>

872
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,890
at the sponsorship ideas you'll get a

873
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:51,118
collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably what Patrick wanted</font>

874
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:53,730
to put in a slide bill but it's our

875
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:58,299
collective working group of ideas for

876
00:36:53,730 --> 00:37:01,089
sponsorship opportunities for 46 we put

877
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:03,160
it for 46 and so what you could see from

878
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:05,230
the sponsorship working group is a

879
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,288
collection of ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could change</font>

880
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:10,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting to meeting based on just some of</font>

881
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:12,309
the kinds of questions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are asking do</font>

882
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,799
we have a change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the environment</font>

883
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:22,089
where we need more collective hands-on

884
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:25,599
type working space or do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

885
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:28,058
a another beer in gear but not call it

886
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,160
beer and gear call it just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font>

887
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:34,900
demo space or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tradeshow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area we've</font>

888
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,470
specifically set up the sponsorship new

889
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:40,599
sponsorship links<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

890
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting to meeting there are some limits</font>

891
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:43,290
of course be

892
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,610
at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going out in</font>

893
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:48,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">negotiating hotel contracts in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

894
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:50,860
future<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a certain amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of space so</font>

895
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:53,620
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to change our sponsorship in</font>

896
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:55,570
concert with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> space limits that we</font>

897
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,330
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they could change meeting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

898
00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:00,760
meeting it it's not set in stone yeah

899
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:04,210
I'm just raising the flag that I think

900
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,580
you've artificially created this idea

901
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,710
that nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not be a trade show</font>

902
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:11,170
and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're limiting what it</font>

903
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:13,480
might might do and what types of

904
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,830
sponsorship possibilities are are there

905
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,930
and I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying you may want to</font>

906
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:19,390
question that assumption what does that

907
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,770
trade show really mean to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and why</font>

908
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do that are there</font>

909
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:24,250
specific things you don't want to do and

910
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,990
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that might help eyes are looking</font>

911
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">for sponsorship as opposed to just</font>

912
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:30,240
trying to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways of getting more</font>

913
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:33,370
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what nanog currently is I</font>

914
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,049
repeat again the that's a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but</font>

915
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,220
that if you want to change the way down

916
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,320
dog is if you want to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the look</font>

917
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,609
and feel the however you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put it</font>

918
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,950
if you want to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flavor of</font>

919
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,870
nanog that's not going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

920
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,879
the working group can or should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

921
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:48,009
looking at that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more for the community</font>

922
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,560
of the whole this meeting the SC and the

923
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:53,410
pc to decide the working group was

924
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,690
specifically designed to work within the

925
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:59,080
boundaries of what does larger groups

926
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:03,010
have already decided the Nano conference

927
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,210
should be so as soon as you know the

928
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,500
community meeting decides that we want

929
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a trade show or whatever else we</font>

930
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,130
want to be then the working group will

931
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:12,220
work within that limitation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font>

932
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:14,230
let me so what a one clarification and

933
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:17,529
then a comment so Patrick's absolutely

934
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:19,240
right but this forum not particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

935
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,370
Patrick on the subject of the Marketing

936
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,200
Committee but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> forum is a great time</font>

937
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">to address that subject because the</font>

938
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,080
steering committees here and you guys

939
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,510
are here and we can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

940
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,420
if Jo has brought that up several times

941
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:33,070
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past and and here's the here's</font>

942
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,010
the substance of how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was brought up</font>

943
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,870
in the past the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is not do</font>

944
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:40,360
we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not want to be a trade</font>

945
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:42,400
show the question is we have a valuable

946
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,410
resource that people who are here

947
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,200
appreciate and continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get advantage</font>

948
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,910
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and we like lots of things about</font>

949
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,339
the way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so the question is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

950
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:53,100
what are the changes that we are

951
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in or willing</font>

952
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,000
except in order to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else</font>

953
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,500
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it like what none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us is here</font>

954
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make money nobody makes money off</font>

955
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,670
this conference so there's no sitting

956
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,990
around saying well how much money can we

957
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,730
make out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this country</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font>

958
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:07,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't care nobody wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a bunch</font>

959
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:09,390
of money but we do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to</font>

960
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,430
fund<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conference and continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

961
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,170
a surplus fund so that we can plan

962
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,370
things out you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and a half in</font>

963
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,840
advance and we can't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

964
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,730
some money so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

965
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,800
care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> money but is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't</font>

966
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,300
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make profit out of this so the</font>

967
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is not should we or should we</font>

968
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,290
not be a trade show the question is what

969
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,790
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys want like what what what are</font>

970
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:29,310
the interactions with your vendors that

971
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,990
you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see at nanog that they</font>

972
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,790
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to pay to facilitate</font>

973
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,459
like beer and gear works because a bunch

974
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are willing to pay a bunch of</font>

975
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">money to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have you come by their booths</font>

976
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,140
and show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of their stuff and</font>

977
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,879
talk to you because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys are</font>

978
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,379
valuable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what are the other</font>

979
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,300
kinds of interactions that would be

980
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,070
useful or at least not objectionable to

981
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys that you would be interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,090
that those vendors would also be willing

983
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pay for I can't believe I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

984
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,540
this because this actually hurts my own

985
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,250
commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest but there are</font>

986
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,440
numerous things you can do in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> event</font>

987
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,320
that are somewhere between a trade show

988
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,200
and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quasi academic event like</font>

989
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,540
you've got now some good examples of how

990
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,129
you can sponsor how you can spawn sorry

991
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,980
now we're gonna minor we go there's some

992
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,870
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples of how you can sponsor or</font>

993
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,090
probably structure sponsorship packages

994
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,890
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than just beer here more</font>

995
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:19,560
than just a break and this is marketing

996
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:22,080
stuff is that us have have tiers of

997
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,700
sponsorship you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have something</font>

998
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,950
like a demo room but don't call it a

999
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,390
demo room actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> give people certain</font>

1000
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,790
amounts of space to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be how much money</font>

1001
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:32,220
they pay it's not an exhibition limited

1002
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,480
to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks you know ten</font>

1003
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,819
companies that make sure it's not an

1004
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,140
exhibition but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also you know the</font>

1005
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,540
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you do is you just make sure</font>

1006
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:42,420
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the break whenever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the brakes are</font>

1007
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:44,490
happens in that room so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gives</font>

1008
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,910
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play with gear or to</font>

1009
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:49,919
talk with sponsors or<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know it</font>

1010
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,750
gives the sponsors value you can let

1011
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">them put in stuffers you can let them</font>

1012
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">put literature on people's seats before</font>

1013
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,740
the event begins these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all things</font>

1014
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,670
that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty standard at non</font>

academic conferences that aren't

1016
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:05,559
czyli sort of exhibitions that aren't

<font color="#CCCCCC">Comdex here there's a whole world</font>

1019
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:12,040
between and you could productize these

1020
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:13,270
sponsorships and you know probably make

1021
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,279
twice the amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money you're making</font>

1022
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,960
now which gives you enough money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1023
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,520
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

like Lucy and and and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bill</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

1036
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:52,240
couple other people when we were in this

1037
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,770
meeting in Santo Domingo said yes you

1038
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,930
can try more you know we said as the

1039
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,520
steering committee you know can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:00,879
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little more commercial you guys</font>

1041
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,890
said yes try some increments and so the

1042
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,170
the idea bill isn't so much putting up a

1043
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:11,319
wall against flat out against<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

1044
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:13,480
structures but just not to go full tilt

1045
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:16,480
in some direction that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may take us</font>

1046
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,890
so far in a direction that the large

1047
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,770
amount of the attendees don't want to

1048
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:22,540
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up so we're seeking what are the</font>

1049
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:27,309
parameters of the increments that people

1050

1085
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:11,750
willingness to host this meeting if any

1086
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:14,780
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are considering hosting an an OGG</font>

1087
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:17,570
meaning and you don't know if you're up

1088
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,700
for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or what's really involved and you</font>

1089
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:22,430
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear from me specifically</font>

1090

<font color="#E5E5E5">at Merritt please talk to run talk to</font>

1091
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:28,850
Steve Feldman Rodney Jaffe there are a

1092
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,460
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> josh who have hosted</font>

1093
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:33,740
nanog and rent even said to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me this</font>

1094
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:36,890
morning man it wasn't as<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad as I</font>

1095
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:40,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to be and that's</font>

1096
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:43,609
what we like to try to get from our<font color="#CCCCCC"> host</font>

1097
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:47,000
there are certainly things that the host

1098
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:49,010
has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to be a host banana but that</font>

1099
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,570
information is all on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website and</font>

1100
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:52,850
there's an outline of the

1101
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:56,600
responsibilities and I would hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1102
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:59,299
as a host you get real kudos from the

1103
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,880
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of you here and thank you</font>

1104
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:04,220
for stepping forward in helping the

1105
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,380
community continue with its tradition of

1106
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,859
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to move around the country</font>

1107
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and from vendor to vendor for hosting</font>

1108
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:14,540
the meeting I think it keeps the

1109
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:16,910
diversity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and some of the newness of our</font>

1110
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:19,310
meeting when we can have new hosts at

1111
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:22,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Merrit if we had the same host in the</font>

1112
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:25,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">same city it might not be the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1113
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:26,759
of nanog might be okay but at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least for</font>

1114
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,610
right now because

1115
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,860
we have had host come forward and<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit</font>

1116
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:35,100
takes on a lot of the workload to make

1117
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:38,160
the meeting I think it keeps our events

1118
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:40,799
that were here having this kind of

1119
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,240

1231
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,900
as well and the pc certainly does

1232
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:47,660

this brief background why merit why does

1298
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:42,309
merit host nanog there's a rich history

1299
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:44,529
of that why do we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from the early</font>

1302
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:52,420
which is the way in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog</font>

1303
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:54,759
originally started with the joint tux

1304
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:57,309
and we move through a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of phases</font>

1305
00:54:54,759 --> 00:55:00,490
if you go online you'll find that rich

1306
00:54:57,309 --> 00:55:02,680
history and the story is there one of

1307
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:05,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the important reasons that I say about</font>

1308
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:09,069
today in why merit is because merit is a

1309
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:13,288
nonprofit organization which is unique

1310
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:16,509
in the role of this very vendor or

1311
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:18,390
for-profit environment that surround us

1312
00:55:16,509 --> 00:55:20,779
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attendee</font>

it's a vendor-neutral that's the word we

1409
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:54,550
constitutes a success and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think nanog</font>

1410
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,280
45 in Santo Domingo was a success I

1411
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:59,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the goals for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going there and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with us to that area I think the</font>

1418
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:21,100
economic downturn did not help us when

1419
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:25,330
we went in February the numbers will

1420
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:28,960
bear that out and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

1421
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:32,230
the registration and the amount of

1422
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,900
effort that I truly didn't quite

1423
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:37,420
anticipate in terms of staffing and in

1424
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:40,180
all that it would take to take nanog out

1425
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:44,260
of the country we had a pretty large

1426

deficit when<font color="#E5E5E5"> all was said and done but</font>

1435
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:19,120
wound up and that's how it goes there's

1436
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:20,890
some wonderful wonderful meetings that

1437
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:24,520
wind up with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reserve that go into</font>

1438
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:26,080
the coffers to carry us forward and then

1439
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:29,440
there are some meetings that don't come

1440
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:32,290
out quite so well and this was one that

1441
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:35,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">we we really couldn't have made it</font>

1442
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:38,259
without tear marks commitment the

1443
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:40,270
rolling meetings as Joe had indicated we

1444
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:43,030
know that nanog 47 is going to be

1445
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:45,400
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Dearborn Michigan Merit and</font>

1446
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:49,060
other networks are co-hosting that

1447
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:51,880
meaning it's the joint meeting with Erin

1448
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:53,950
so it's a back to back meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font>

1449
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to highlight for everyone there is a</font>

01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:09,980

1455

vote on charter amendments charter

1501
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:36,118
amendments can be put in the ballot two

1502
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,890
ways one is the steering committee can

1503
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:39,960
decide to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> something on the other one</font>

1504
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:41,519
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a petition by at least 30 eligible</font>

1505
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,440
voters or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1% of eligible voters</font>

1506
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,808
whichever is greater I don't know the

1507
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:49,259
number off the top of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> head but we can</font>

1508
01:04:45,809 --> 01:04:51,239
figure it out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will in time so if</font>

1509
01:04:49,259 --> 01:04:53,069
you guys have an idea for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an amendment</font>

1510
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:58,079
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the steering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> committee doesn't like</font>

1511
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:59,609
it you can still put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on okay why the</font>

1512
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:02,579
Nano charters are equivalent of

1513
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:04,680
corporate bylaws<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Constitution nanog</font>

1514
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:08,670
itself isn't really an organization but

1515
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:09,839
we pretend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is so we act the</font>

1516
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:12,839
steering committee ice like a board of

1517
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:16,499
directors we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the charter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that acts</font>

1518
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:18,029
like corporate bylaws and we all sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1519
01:05:16,499 --> 01:05:21,169
have an agreement that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1520
01:05:18,029 --> 01:05:21,170
follow them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the right thing</font>

1521
01:05:22,069 --> 01:05:26,819
amendments are there so that we can fix

1522
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:33,630
errors or react changing times or

1523
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:35,640
whatever makes sense I before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go on</font>

1524
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,989
this some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've had</font>

1525
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,749
as amendments in the past are just

1526
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:41,450
cleaning up basic language something's

1527
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:43,950
have been ambiguous or just plain wrong

1528
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:47,460
we've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> some processes more</font>

1529
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:49,680
consistent like the mailing list

1530
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:51,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee selection process is much more</font>

1531
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,308
like the program committee selection

1532
01:05:51,479 --> 01:05:55,739

the pieces of feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the pc is</font>

1584
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,830
definitely looking for out of this

meetings ahead of time and as Betty said

1591
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:23,250
that's a large impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> on merit to make</font>

1592
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:25,080
those commitments<font color="#CCCCCC"> upfront</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the pc</font>

1593
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:26,970

cards are charged later on for some

1598
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:36,000
reason because of your constraints

1599
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,260
inside your budget within your

1600
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,450
