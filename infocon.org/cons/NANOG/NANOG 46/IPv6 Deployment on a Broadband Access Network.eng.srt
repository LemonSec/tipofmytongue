the important thing to note to note here

39

is that each user has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

receive an ipv4 or ipv6 in the future

very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that each user receives</font>

translation ipv6 with ipv6 this doesn't

additional ipv6 global addresses

the user to know that is that he

some also some complications we related

at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but the important</font>

145
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,639
thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> note is that all the users get</font>

146
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:43,150
/ 64 prefixes either for the one link or

147
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:46,300
the landlink behind it so a few words on

148
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:49,150
how ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> or most of you probably knows</font>

149
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:53,590
all about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the LCP is completely</font>

150
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:56,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">insane and and the ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CP contrary to</font>

151
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,210
end to the NCP phase 4i before is much

152
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,489
simpler because there are no address is

153
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,888
no dns options involved at this point

154
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,440
the only option<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> option that</font>

155
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,120
is that is being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> and please note</font>

156
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,509
that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> important for our</font>

157
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,770

158
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:18,400
are the lowest 64 bits that the cpe will

159
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:23,380
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using to create his PPP ipv6 one</font>

162
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,370
familiar with we after the the PPP

163
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:38,260
establishes itself between the LNS and

164
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,610
the CP<font color="#E5E5E5"> well ipv6 address</font>

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,208
auto-configuration is being done

166
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:45,550
normally do note that the interface ID

167
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:50,050
which are the 64 bits are being is being

168

<font color="#CCCCCC">configuration and like I said the</font>

171
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,440
recommendation is always to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> last 64</font>

the CP<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the tricky part oh that was</font>

174
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,529
easy okay this is just ipv6 or pvp the

175
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,800
tricky<font color="#CCCCCC"> part is to enumerate the homeland</font>

176
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:14,589
behind the behind the CP we in our in

177
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:19,300
our opinion the the ideal way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font>

178
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:21,400
is to use an RFC for 389 which is which

179
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,810
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called ND proxy neighbor discovery</font>

180
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:30,939
proxies and basically with with this

181
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:34,719
method one can use one only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one / 64</font>

182
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,490
ipv6 prefix to innominate both the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PvP</font>

183
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,860
one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that face of the CP and the</font>

184
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:43,750
homeland of the user behind the CP so

185
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:48,010
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is pretty good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

186
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:51,190
only one 64 so we made we make a prefix

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:55,180
economy at this point but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font>

188
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:58,600
aware of any CP is that implement this

00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,420
feature at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the usage of</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature is default for the future</font>

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:09,069
unfortunately so the best the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

dhcpv6 protects the legation works like

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,420
this the cpe after the establishment of

199
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:36,130
the PPP link and the enumeration of the

200

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,200
intention to use the same local ipv6

same ipv6 local traffic school for

209

enumerate both<font color="#CCCCCC"> Edwin America the</font>

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:19,400
requests and receives a much last 64 as

it sees fit it proceeds to issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> routed</font>

217
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:41,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok a few words on how how do you</font>

218
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement how do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> implement the</font>

219
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:46,980
enumeration of the PvP link and then the

220
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:51,020
homeland behind the CP<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok first for the</font>

221
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:55,610
PvP link we are interested in mainly to

222
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:58,890
ITF radius attribute the first is the

223
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,660
same day<font color="#E5E5E5"> same the interface I did the</font>

224
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,610
famed interface ID like I said it is

225
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the lowest 64 bits of the</font>

226
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:08,390
address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be that the CPA</font>

227
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,220
of the user is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be using and</font>

228
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,100
then the framed ipv6 pool is the name of

229
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,740
the local ipv6 address pool within the

230
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,440
LNS that is going to be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to issue</font>

231
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,440
the neighbor discovery route rather

232
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:27,210
route advertisements<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at Iseman</font>

233
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:29,160
inside the PPP link so the LNS sense and

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,070
access access<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests to the radius</font>

235
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,219
this is our reduce this is not the not

00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:37,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP radius please note that and the</font>

237
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,960
axis the access except contains these

238
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,689
two attributes for example then the ipv6

239
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,340
pool is the pool of institution number

240
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:47,550
two and then the frame framed interface

241
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:51,150
ID is a specific 64-bit address and then

242
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,579
the LNS at least on our is now our iOS

243
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,610
version which is if I remember correctly

244
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:58,290
12.3 the framed interface ID is also

245
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,940
included in the accounting start and

246
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,670
stop messages which are being sent by

247
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,810
the LNS to

248
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,729
the radio server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is pretty</font>

249
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard because we are using ITF</font>

250
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">attributes so it's quite okay the tricky</font>

251
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,520
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for the ipv6 perfect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dtp v6</font>

252
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:19,780

253
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:22,090
afterwards because here here our

254
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:26,800
equipment<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this point does not have</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to use a an ITF attribute to</font>

256
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,689

263
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:55,390
on the local address pool which we have

264
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:58,660
mentioned earlier to make sure that the

265
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,150
cpe has been struck to make sure that

266
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,240
the LNS has the instructions to<font color="#E5E5E5"> delegate</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct address to the CP we have to</font>

269
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:13,870

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,750
in the index the command ipv6 dhcp

the interface go figure of the pvp<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

273
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,819
that way when using the the same like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

274
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,000
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before we are using the same ipv6</font>

local prefix pool both for the one and

276
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,710
for the land and this is of course

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,180
results to simple configuration

278
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:37,690
uniformity and more efficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> use of the</font>

279
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:42,010
available address prefixes that we have

280
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:45,880
in our disposal okay how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with</font>

281
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:50,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">dns and most most of you probably know</font>

282
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:54,510
all about it and there's LFC 5006 which

283
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:58,660
is a way to inject dns configuration

284
00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:00,370
inside the ND arrays but ok we'll have

285
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,170
to wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little about this because</font>

it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everywhere</font>

288
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:11,230
okay and also will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be evaluating any gas</font>

289
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:16,380
DNS in the future although I don't feel

290
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:18,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's gonna it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

291
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:23,079
all these all these methods<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

292
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:26,680
described briefly in RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> 433 and 39 as</font>

293
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:30,760
you can see and ok the way that we are

294
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,979
doing at this point is a the use of the

295
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,079
other option flag inside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ndarray</font>

296
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is being sent by the LNS to the CP</font>

297
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:42,399
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically like it was said</font>

298
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:45,240
yesterday in the other presentation by

299
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:52,570
comcast this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is dhcpv6 stateless mode</font>

300
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:54,519
you can insert the the option<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns server</font>

301
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,620
and then the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a v6</font>

302
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,810
address of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS sorry we had the</font>

303
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">others of the dns server inside the ipv6</font>

304
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:05,050
dhcp pool as you can see the ipv6 dhcp

305
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:08,680
pool here has the prefix delegation

306
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:13,050
command and then we also add the dns

307
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:17,349
server option and this works this works

308
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:20,439
this works quite well with the IP IP CP

309
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:25,180
dns settings which are transmitted via

310
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:27,760
the in the NCP phase of the of PPP and

311
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,839
then of course in the future is the

312
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,600
capability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add other options I mean</font>

313
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:37,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">apart from DNS like smtp service and</font>

314
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,690
other another interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> capabilities</font>

315
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:43,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok well of course we're interested in</font>

316
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:48,069
ipv6 accounting because we want to know

317
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:50,260
which with ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> / fix each one of our</font>

318
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:53,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> received each one of our users</font>

319
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:59,319

320
00:16:53,110 --> 00:17:03,430
land behind the CP<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok because our iOS</font>

321
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:06,609
version at this point some attributes

322
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:08,740
missing we only attribute present on the

323
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:11,079
on the accounting messages it is a

324
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,929
framed interface ID so framed interface

325
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,550
ID is only the lowest 64 bits so what do

326
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:19,780
we do we make sure

327
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:23,560
each user has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a unique 64 interface ID</font>

328
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:26,139
so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I connect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the edge of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SN</font>

329
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my ipv6</font>

330
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:32,920
address has always has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 bits the</font>

331
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,770
lowest<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 bits the same so how do we do</font>

332
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,560
it one simple way is to get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> username</font>

333
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:41,020
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> has it to buy an appropriate passing</font>

334
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:45,220
function to 64 bits all we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font>

335
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:47,830
the future store store these 64 IDs in a

336
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,900
in a database but at this point we

337
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,480
believe that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no problem to</font>

338
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,370
using a hashing function and this does

339
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,800
not affect the hungry dishes at all

340
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:01,860
because we cannot will suppress the the

341
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,020
transmission of this interface to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

342
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,600
home ranges of its home radishes of its

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:11,350
user the home radius of its user sorry

344
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,620
and so some problems we have encountered

345
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:18,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the while researching all this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

346
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:21,040
the first problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that like I said</font>

347
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,200
it's institution assigns ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses</font>

348
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,909
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the youth for its users to receive</font>

349
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,370
and also its institutions have

350
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:30,730
insistence<font color="#E5E5E5"> your institution has the</font>

351
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:33,729
right to define a policy which is being

352
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,230
expressed as a as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> access list in the</font>

353
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,120
virtual template the virtual template is

354
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:43,240
the PPP interface connecting the user

355
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:46,510
with the infrastructure but we I mean we

356
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,570
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up we can upon this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nastik</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bag</font>

357
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:53,710
because when you try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use both access</font>

358
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:55,659

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,390
same virtual interfaces the virtual

360
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,880
interface doesn't come up at all because

361
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,840
there is a name class between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipv4</font>

362
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,690
and the net and the ipv6 nay access list

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:22,750
will be implementing a new feature which

368
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:27,280
would which would require<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">correctly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok one other problem is that</font>

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:56,310
this is danger that it might it might

practices to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enumerate the homeland but</font>

381
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,090
many more this is this is a problem

382
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I mean this could lead to ipv6</font>

383
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:10,280
perfect address exhaustion so we would

384
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:12,990
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to resource to</font>

00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:17,970
limit the resource the resources

386
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:20,010
assigned to each subscriber and as I

387
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:23,550
described earlier of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there are</font>

388
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:27,120
some ITF ipv6 attributes missing from

389
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:28,500
our current iOS version so we have to

390
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,840
resort to the users of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> framed</font>

course the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that we have to</font>

402
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,669
the virtual profile profile cloning

403
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:14,550
which has a performance impact on<font color="#E5E5E5"> PvP</font>

404
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:17,690
establishment in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrastructure but</font>

405
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:20,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok we don't we don't feel like this is a</font>

406
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:24,510
mostly I mean we don't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font>

407
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:27,420
too serious ok but 11 serious problem is

408
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:31,230
that at this point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have now we have</font>

409
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:33,960
found of no way to do dhcpv6 accounting

410
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:37,680
dv6 accounting so basically we don't

411
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,980
know which prefix your cpe receive and

412
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,230
enumerate the homeland behind the

413
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:46,309
behind it so we can we can end up having

414
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:51,169
users that we don't know the address

415
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:54,230
they are using so one one question that

416
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:57,140
might arise and I've been anticipating

417
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,720
this question is why not use static ipv6

418
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,299
graphics is per user and you know in

419
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,549
fact this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite logical</font>

420
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:07,820
because it would result in too much much

421
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:10,940
much simpler radius configuration the

422
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:14,270
dhcpv6 prefix delegation could be set up

423
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,549
quite easily and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the L&S</font>

424
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:19,100
implementation which at this point is

425
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:22,190
cisco wires would not be that important

426
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:27,250
but please note that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have at this</font>

427
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:31,419

fix whatever problems arise along the

my<font color="#CCCCCC"> hands on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Juniper III 20 I mean this</font>

which are the production device at this

479
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,490
point and so I thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font>

480
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">find interesting some some key facts</font>

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:22,260
about the junos<font color="#E5E5E5"> II which is the</font>

483
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point it's quite interesting</font>

484
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:34,800
because we see here the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> famed ipv6</font>

485
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:39,169
pool attribute which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDF</font>

486
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:42,510
attribute is usable to make to implement

487
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:45,720
dhcpv6 prefix delegation so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

488
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,390
quite good of course there's also the

489
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,380
delegated ipv6 prefix this is also an

490
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:55,590
IDF attribute and this can be used to

491
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:57,630
explicitly define the the ipv6 projects

492
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:01,720
that is going to be used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dhcpv6</font>

493
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:04,840
prefix delegation but please note<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

494
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:08,160
delegated ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphics when using this</font>

495
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:13,600
attribute we must explicitly define the

496
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:16,030
ipv6 graphics exactly not report so for

497
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,360
the one link the PPP link we cannot use

498
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:22,750
a pool an ipv6 local pool within the the

499
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:26,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">Juniper device unfortunately so in order</font>

500
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:29,050
to enumerate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tp-link with a neighbor</font>

501
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,930
discovery route or advertisements we

502
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:35,560
must we must must use the flame<font color="#E5E5E5"> diabetes</font>

503
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:37,600
six perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we must define the ipv6</font>

504
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:41,679
prefix explicitly we cannot use the Pope

505
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,840
the pool so one would go with either one

506
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,010
of these two approaches the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

507
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,110
approach would be to use the app the

508
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:53,050
frame type ev6 prefix and the delegated

509
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:55,090
of ipv6 prefix so all the ipv6 addresses

510
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:57,850
are being managed by the radius server

511
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:01,360
so the radio server exclusively manages

512
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:04,600
all the ipv6 addresses the second

513
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:10,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite awkward is to</font>

514
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:15,550
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the framed ipv6 pool to use to</font>

515
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:18,010
enumerate to make dhcpv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> correctly the</font>

516
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:21,010
legation work and then use the framed

517
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:25,270
ipv6 projects for the PPP connection and

518
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:27,910
this is quite vocal why because half we

519
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,040
have the ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses are being marked</font>

520
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:32,770
by the radius server and then half the

521
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:37,510
other ipv6 addresses are being used by

522
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:41,470
the by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in a local ipv6 pool within</font>

523
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:43,450
the LNS so I don't know it's it's quite

524
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:46,120
freaky i don't know i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how it</font>

525
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,220
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done at this point and we're</font>

526
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:52,209
still think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if we are going to</font>

527
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,700
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a journey by device so um yeah</font>

528
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:58,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's that pretty much concludes the</font>

529
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:02,290
presentation open it it is not so it was

530
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:05,720
not long<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh good okay well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scheduled</font>

531
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:09,080
you know perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

532
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:12,860
ah we have what somebody is actually

533
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:16,669
awake out there I'm so<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy my Joseph</font>

534
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google um regarding static assignment it</font>

535
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,210
sounds like your primary concern was

536
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,150
propagating around information across

537
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,560
your multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis and I GP</font>

538
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:28,490
convergence have you considered running

539
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:30,440
vgp from the LNS which should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

540
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:35,300
at managing that size routing in that

541
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:38,150
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of churn yeah ok basically this</font>

542
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:40,129
this whole scheme can you hear me<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

543
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:43,730
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this whole scheme was</font>

544
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:45,950
designed like three years ago by our

545
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:50,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">rotor guys are mainly an access guy but</font>

546
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:54,890
I'm going to answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you mean that</font>

547
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,680
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the thought we haven't</font>

548
00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:02,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">really considered bgp but we have</font>

549
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:06,290
considered using separate ospf areas for

550
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:08,689
each LNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean ok the etl NS and its</font>

551
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:10,879
uplink is on a different ospf area to

552
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:17,030
minimize the routing updates that are

553
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:20,210
being done so when when when when a

554
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:23,270
prefix comes up in LNS one all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

555
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:29,890
illnesses doesn't don't need to know

556
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:32,030
about the about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this update which is</font>

557
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:35,750
basically the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

559
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,220
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean bgp handles that level of</font>

560
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,560
churn quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than an igp</font>

561
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,380
does is there a specific reason you

562
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,600
can't use bgp in your application at

563
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:51,140
this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not sure that i can</font>

564
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:54,110
answer it because it was I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

00:29:51,140 --> 00:30:02,270
decided right before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i entered the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6</font>

00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:08,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about the cpe routers</font>

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:15,740
you see yeah yeah yeah like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said my</font>

570
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:22,310
all my experiments my I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

571
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:26,900
tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've done so far did I do</font>

572
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:30,050
that ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have experimented with with</font>

573
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:32,740
windows vista and a pvp over ethernet

574
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:37,340
configuration and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm waiting for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

575
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:40,520
for some as ipv6 enabled CP is from a

576
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:43,580
company called billion to arrive and do

577
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:46,520
some tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you haven't played</font>

578
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:52,189
around with any other in space tour I

579
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:54,740
just know it works it works the yeah

580
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,800
this this guy alexandros go see alice

581
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:03,890
has been playing around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he also set</font>

582
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:06,379
up a freebsd freebsd client and it

583
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:08,660
worked and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my might I says what better</font>

584
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:12,530
because when we when we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing</font>

585
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:19,670
with this thing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vista the Vista</font>

586
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:22,730
implementation had some buggy dhcpv6 DCP

587
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:27,080
plavix delegation behavior but we were

588
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:29,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to you know configure our freebsd</font>

589
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,449
right away to<font color="#E5E5E5"> request only one</font>

590
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:35,570
prediction work perfectly I was

591
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,460
primarily wondering if it is suddenly

592
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,370
become possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

593
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually works off the shelf easily and</font>

594
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:47,149
I guess the answer is not quite yet I I

595
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:51,380
agree with you it's quite there yet I

596
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:55,520
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like cell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has some</font>

597
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:57,900
ipv6 enabled the series but you guys

598
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,629
surprised me to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like</font>

599
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:03,900
you are to your open wrt either but you

600
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:06,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the the zyxel obviously is going to</font>

601
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,980
be easier for support<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm you're</font>

602
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:15,120
actually excellent you can call yeah

603
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:17,700
yeah yeah i agree i think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean as</font>

604
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can see in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our presentation we had</font>

605
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:24,180
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more serious problems on worrying</font>

606
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:27,450
about making every cpe playable because

607
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,490
i like it like you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

608
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,730
quite some time we had we have problem

609
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:38,610
with enabling ipv6 because of the ipv4

610
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 access list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the name class which</font>

611
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:45,449
prevented us from doing any real tests

612
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:52,040
on the production infrastructure thank

613
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:57,150
you but maybe from hurricane electric

614
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:58,980
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a general mindset in the v6</font>

615
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,080
world the auto configuration makes

616
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:05,070
everything very easy on the v6 side and

617
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:10,290
you've proven it isn't I'm okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

618
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:12,030
that I'm also doing with that thing but

619
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:15,240
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to you ask a question</font>

620
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:17,340
about monitoring relating customers

621
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,670
between your v6 addresses and your v4

622
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:23,220
addresses you have a put this politely

623
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:26,370
you have a student body as your user

624
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,870
base and there is a mindset that every

625
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:31,500
now and again that causes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

626
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:33,870
of a problem whether it be rope laptops

627
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:37,080
or software or whatever with insight

628
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:39,090
that large community you have non ite

629
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,550
style control over what have you done

630
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">for monitoring over and above all of the</font>

631
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:45,750
work that you've done from the dhcp side

632
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,639
of the world what have you done<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

633
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:52,080
monitoring and relating traffic between

634
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:53,670
v4 and v6 clients based upon the level

635
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,409
of complexity that you've built<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

636
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,660
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then my second question I'll go</font>

637
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:59,280
sit down is can you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

638
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,460
traffic levels and where you see that

639
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font>

640
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:07,300
you know I've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a aggregate level of</font>

641
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:08,710
all of your work I'm not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

642
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,719
understand the question if you are

643
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,490
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about which is what is the ratio</font>

644
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,489
are you asking about the ratio between

645
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:17,319
ipv4 and ipv6 traffic no no I'm actually

646
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,509
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it's a general</font>

647
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,560
question take it second as general

648
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,150
traffic levels that you're actually

649
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,159
seeing from your customer base but the

650
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,510
first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the Griffin yeah that's</font>

651
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,069
the more important yes surely<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure to</font>

652
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:29,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">show yet the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ones more important</font>

653
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:32,730
in the sense of how do you map between

654
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:36,040
and look after here's a drug load I

655
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,719
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's all</font>

656
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,330
come up and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's fine it was</font>

657
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:43,509
like 3 megabits like a some months ago

658
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:46,270
it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point it's it's much larger</font>

659
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the first question is so how are</font>

660
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,659
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your mapping and looking after</font>

661
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:52,000
and seeing whether you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

662
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:54,100
with your customer base between the v6

663
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,929
addresses that you see the v4 addresses

664
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,430
that you see and the tools that you had

665
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,649
for v4 and how you're dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those</font>

666
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:01,509
in the v6 world hmm yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

667
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">good question it's it's quite pretty</font>

668
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,370
actually to do it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I but it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

669
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">all its own I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

670
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:12,549
concerns me<font color="#E5E5E5"> only because access services</font>

671
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:15,430
are always are always tricky because you

672
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:19,300
have end users so even the slightest

673
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:22,299
thing you do affects users and you know

674
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:25,120
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me were talking we could</font>

675
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:27,820
communicate quite easily i would run

676
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,830
pain stress routes or whatever and see

677
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:33,070
what's happened but the user exactly

678
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:35,170
like we said the user is mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

679
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:38,800
at the worst case the user is clueless

680
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:43,840
right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

681
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,690
mean when we started doing some tests we

682
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:52,660
I mean it was a horror story indeed

683
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:54,670
because we after two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three days we we</font>

684
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,270
saw that some some users could not

685
00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:01,420
connect and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we identified</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipv4</font>

686
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:05,200
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> name class there was no way for us</font>

687
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,390
to know that in advance I mean this

688
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,790
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are serious problems and I totally</font>

689
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree with you and we</font>

690
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:14,100
have a magic method to know if the if

691
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:17,069
some users having are having a

692
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,870
particular problem or not but I believe

693
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,910
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the this is the general gage</font>

694
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:23,490
with access services access services I

695
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:26,460
think I are the most tricky part<font color="#E5E5E5"> two I</font>

696
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:31,290
mean I'm it most tricky to to

697
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:38,490
troubleshoot if I cover your question

698
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:41,100
right yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> antonella boss daughter I'm</font>

699
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">curious if you could perhaps expand some</font>

700
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:46,319
of the data in this presentation perhaps

701
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:49,740
an updated slides or something to the

702
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,990
net all users list to include perhaps a

703
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,629
fuel growth and snippets from your

704
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:56,490
virtual templates I think there might be

705
00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:00,270
helpful for folks to see how at least

706
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:03,600
your deployment has utilized combination

707
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:06,540
of a/b pair from radius as well as local

708
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,880
pool on your Ellen<font color="#E5E5E5"> esas I think the snip</font>

709
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:11,340
as we saw we're good I'm Johnny I'm

710
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,010
genuinely curious though about anything

711
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've done with any perhaps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mr are you</font>

from how it was in the v four days only

no no and maybe maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now I'll go</font>

733
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,980
to the I'll go to the second question

right away and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> return to the first</font>

735

if that's okay with you

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,190
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point we have not</font>

should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there shouldn't be there not</font>

increases of course if even when there

742
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:54,610
is a traffic increase we don't have to

743
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,970
when we won't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ISPs</font>

744
00:38:54,610 --> 00:39:00,310
or the pit it is because the Greek the

745
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:04,359
Greek research network is the uplink so

746
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:09,190
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the I mean we're with</font>

on the lower left side are only doing an

00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:32,080
administrative tasks like they register

755
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,720
the the register the users they do all

are maintaining the passwords current

759
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:53,140
thank you sorry the the first question

760
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:55,660
was if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could perhaps update the talk</font>

761

Wynter on or send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few notes to be</font>

762
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:01,390
nanog user list or so no prob yeah no

763
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem just drop some role in config</font>

764
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,200
details browse yeah the virtual the

765
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,150
virtual interface is a virtual template

766
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,939
configuration is quite simple I mean the

767
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:13,150
this is of course ipv6 enable command

768
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:17,650
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is also a command that</font>

769
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:19,810
says do not suppress do not suppress the

772
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,980
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem you can catch me later if you</font>

feel like sure

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:31,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mention is that there was a a dearth</font>

you mentioned it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the 10,000 is a</font>

781
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:55,359
whole different story this is a I this

00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:58,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">is cisco iOS software based 7 300 so</font>

783
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,970
yeah i agree with you if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a 10,000</font>

784
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:06,200
it would be maybe it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be somewhat</font>

785
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:07,939
different er er<font color="#E5E5E5"> ericsson so this was</font>

786
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">very interesting thank you i did have</font>

787
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,140
one comment oh you said that prefix

788
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,190
delegation force your second choice

789
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,180
after in deepak singh I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

790
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,910
prefix to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said what's the right</font>

791
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:22,000
choice and that is something that you

792
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:26,509
should do or should have done anyway

793
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not absolutely India proxy has some</font>

794
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:31,030
limitations it doesn't work you know for

795
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,730
all security mechanisms that we have for

796
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:37,369
physics and if you do prefix delegation

797
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,410
from day one that allows you to later<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

798
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:43,940
increase and provision address space

799
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:46,040
further your users in a flexible way so

800
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,880
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the right architect is</font>

801
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:54,080
also I believe the architecture that was

802
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:57,560
or is in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> proud</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> man forum plans when</font>

803
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:03,170
they are looking at the dsl ipv6 in a

804
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:06,560
more general sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let our mind go</font>

805
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:10,550
I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you me and thank you for</font>

806
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,759
your remarks right the the amend the

807
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:19,150
main goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> here was to try to minimize</font>

808
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:22,220
ipv6 prefix expenditure right because

809
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:25,640
what I what I really like about ND proxy

810
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:28,279
is that you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> use one prefix and okay</font>

811
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,750
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ridiculous probably because i</font>

812
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,850
think it is ridiculous such is

813
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:34,250
ridiculous because this is ipv6 so we

814
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:36,500
had we're supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have infinite</font>

815
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,119
addresses at our disposal right it's not

816
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,740
as you

817
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,059
it's only 16 bits so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you have</font>

818
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,490
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we're not spending</font>

819
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:48,849
spending prefix is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy so that's</font>

820
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:52,439
why I like Andy proxy but yes very much

821
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:54,609
other considerations overweight those

822
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,039
address growing concerns and you weren't

823
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:58,720
burning them like crazy anyway so

824
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:01,569
there's other applications that burn

825
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,509
them for Adam for hire a right good it's

826
00:43:01,569 --> 00:43:07,890
very reasonable to assign the slack 66

827
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:12,460
for multiple slacks / 6 forced to

828
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:14,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">subscriber</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and well our team our team</font>

829
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,910
has also worked on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Greek school</font>

830
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,799
network this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a Greek student</font>

831
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:20,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the grid school network provides</font>

832
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:24,460
access to the two I mean you know

833
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:27,490
elementary schools and that kinds of in

834
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,829
high school and it was much simpler

835
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,890
because each school has a rotor which is

836
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:35,890
administered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so we have set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

837
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:38,019
dhcpv6 there but everything starting

838
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:41,980
everything starting date CP v6 static

839
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:43,899
PvP static everything and okay this is

840
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:46,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay when this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is absolutely i mean</font>

841
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:49,809
there's absolute control over the of the

842
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:51,759
expenditure of ipv6 prefixes I I agree

843
00:43:49,809 --> 00:43:54,009
with you there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no absolutely no</font>

844
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:56,680
problem with dhcp v6 perfect delegation

845
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:59,829
in fact it's it's been in some ways it's

846
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:03,700
beneficial because you can use other I

847
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:07,390
mean other lengths other than 64 right

848
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:11,739
so that's right I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font>

849
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:13,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean on principle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you thank</font>

850
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:13,799
you

851
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:24,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll have it maybe I'd have</font>

852
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:27,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">to discuss this a bgp issue again</font>

853
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,698
because this is the second time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

854
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:32,999
