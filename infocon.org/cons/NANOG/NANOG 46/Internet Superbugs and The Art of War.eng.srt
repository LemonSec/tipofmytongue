1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
alright so those of you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,869
who Paul<font color="#CCCCCC"> vixy has turn to the person</font>

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,459
next to you and ask them you know I uh I

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,340
was in terms of a short introduction

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,860
because this group more or less almost

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,350
everybody knows as much or more about

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,020
Paul as I do I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could just make</font>

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,380
stuff up and see so I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,240
several several interesting idea so one

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,890
of the things I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to say is that</font>

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,948
Paul<font color="#CCCCCC"> vicks he actually invented the idea</font>

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,539
of a packet so prior to that people

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,679
weren't sure they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this idea that we</font>

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,510
were going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move information around</font>

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,250
but nobody had thought of putting it in

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">a packet and that was Paul who did that</font>

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,520
the other one was back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the early days</font>

18
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of you remember this in the early</font>

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,420
days of the bite<font color="#CCCCCC"> wars it was Paul who</font>

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,809
actually convinced everyone that<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,309
was the correct number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bits in a byte</font>

22
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:48,870
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

23
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,940
bit and there was the 11 there was a

24
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,530
12-bit can didn't make any sense and

25
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,300
Paul<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put down his fist and said no</font>

26
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,860
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 bits and he said it</font>

27
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,328
was such authority and panache that

28
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,320
everybody believed him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's why we</font>

29
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a bit bites no none of these things</font>

30
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">are true Paul has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been involved in the</font>

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,890
internet for longer than many of us have

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,530
been conscious and he's going to talk to

33
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">us about well certainly this morning and</font>

34
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,430
he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking to us about</font>

35
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,430
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> superbugs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the art of war</font>

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,540
Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Todd thank you everyone I was</font>

37
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:40,750
asked by several members of the security

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,799
community to keep track of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how</font>

39
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:47,380
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you looked up from your email to</font>

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,330
actually listen to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> sabe I'll be</font>

41
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,530
sort of peering out trying to get poll

42
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,970
on that topic um I guess what Todd

43
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,640
didn't mention is that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

44
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,039
harder and harder to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find anybody in our</font>

45
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:05,340
industry who has not<font color="#CCCCCC"> been lectured to or</font>

46
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:12,370
yelled at by me on the subject of the

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:14,680
scale of morality so when they were sort

48
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,680
of looking for a keynote speaker I

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,860
realized that the internet security

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,360
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the history of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

51
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,090
starting to look uncomfortably to me

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,470
like the movie Groundhog Day where you

53
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,329
do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing over and over and over</font>

54
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:34,090
again and you just seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be stuck</font>

55
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:37,630
there so I've put some thought into why

56
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:42,519
we are still doing the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing 10 20</font>

57
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,840
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later and why we keep losing some</font>

58
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,680
of you who have heard some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

59
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">before I want to say I've taken the</font>

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,060
unusual step of quoting some people

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,850
without their permission I think you'll

62
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">see that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the way I filed off</font>

63
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,090
all possible context that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

64
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,530
actually an information leak if any of

65
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,780
you

66
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,060
they're in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room or on the video feel</font>

67
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have stolen your jokes and should</font>

68
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> given you credit please let me out</font>

69
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:27,340
so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me begin by talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

70
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:29,708
antibacterial soap there are chemicals

71
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,640
you can put into liquid soap that will

72
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,200
kill germs and what parent doesn't think

73
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,790
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something like</font>

74
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,738
that in the bathroom where the kids are

75
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,500
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wash their hands this stuff</font>

76
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">flies off the shelves costs a little</font>

77
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,880
more than soap that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have that</font>

78
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">chemical but people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are glad to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay an</font>

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,480
incremental fifty cents here a dollar

80
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,989
there in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have fewer germs in</font>

81
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,560
their house it's just it's an automatic

82
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:03,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">cell it's also an automatic bad idea</font>

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:07,269
because its indiscriminate it kills all

84
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:10,299
kinds of germs that are probably doing

85
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,590
you some good if they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing you</font>

86
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,420
some good they might be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">elsewhere in the ecosystem but those</font>

88
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:20,019
chemicals often pass successfully

89
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,330
through the sewer systems and our

90
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:29,110
killing germs long after they have been

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:31,150
in your sink the specific thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

92
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,870
bothers me<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the rise of</font>

93
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,830
antibacterial soap is that it kills the

94
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,419
weaker germs that are bad for you

95
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:44,500
leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the strong ones to fill</font>

96
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:46,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">that ecological niche I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

97
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,570
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to train the German population</font>

98
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:52,299
in that way but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is what we are</font>

99
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing hundreds of millions of us are</font>

100
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that every day did I mention this</font>

101
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,960
stuff is flying off the shelves a

102
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,690
rational act for one of us or a

103
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,479
seemingly rational<font color="#CCCCCC"> act does not</font>

104
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:10,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily add up to a rational act in</font>

the context of a population<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other</font>

106
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,280
words it doesn't scale is

107
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:24,670
now I did this if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a lot</font>

108
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:29,050
of spam today I am one of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

109
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:31,570
caused you to to get so much because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

110
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,920
was antibacterial soap for the spam

111
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:38,650
industry in the late 90s I had a lot of

112
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,190
passion a lot of anger about people

113
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,969
using their networks to send me traffic

114
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:49,360
i didn't want came up with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font>

115
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:51,250
male abuse prevention system that is

116
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,920
spam spelled backward in case you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

117
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:59,320
paying attention and it did a lot of

118
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">short-term good at least to make me feel</font>

119
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,469
good it caused a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who would</font>

120
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">otherwise have just rented a t3 which</font>

121
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,260
was then the fast fast kind of link on

122
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:13,840
the net<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sent spam all day long to</font>

123
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:19,270
not be able to do that and so they were

124
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,280
frustrated<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was sued there are many</font>

125
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,289
legends that are told of the supposed

126
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,940
fortune that I once had that the lawyers

127
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:32,260
have now so not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I lose I am the</font>

128
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:35,290
reason that spammers now use botnets so

129
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:38,550
you can thank me<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that I made them</font>

130
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">smarter I killed off the weak ones I</font>

131
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:47,160
caused the ones who were determined and

132
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:49,960
we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjust their approach to</font>

133
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,020
to win drive the bad ones out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

134
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,520
business out-compete them and they are

135
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,520
the ones who are spamming you today

136
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:06,620
you all did this last year a company

<font color="#E5E5E5">called at revo had Kolohe space and</font>

places including<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 call and we had</font>

140

space at 200 call and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can remember for</font>

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,900
a couple of years walking by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ituri</font>

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,890
from this is where most of the payment

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems for illegal transactions were</font>

147
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:37,860
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was saying why did they get to be</font>

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:41,190
here and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had this sort of</font>

149
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,690
simmering rage about it not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wanted to reach in and you know cut</font>

152
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,039
would obviously come fix that and it

153
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,070
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be illegal and so forth but I just</font>

154
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,870
wondered why are they allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to operate</font>

155
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,090
alongside the rest of us when virtually

156
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,830
everybody in the industry knows exactly

157
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,659
who they are they know exactly what

158
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,210
they're doing and yet they can still

159
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,310
come in here and buy services and they

160
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,349
can get address space that the rest of

161
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">us will agree is theirs and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will treat</font>

as unique they can exchange bgp they can

163
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:22,680
exchange dns why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we so open to these</font>

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,810
mobs to the castle<font color="#CCCCCC"> and had it work out</font>

166
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:32,729
badly for me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not ready to go do</font>

167
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,860
that other people were and the folks at

at revo of course protested their

169
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,140
innocence and found all kinds of friends

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">and defenders who said oh I know those</font>

189
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:34,050
you did is the total spam volume in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2008</font>

192
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:42,209
a trough I admit but the spam volume

193
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:43,680
came back latent late in the year and it

194
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,660
came back<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong enough that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the area</font>

197
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:57,240
certainly we certainly did hurt some

198
00:09:53,670 --> 00:10:00,449
people who were profiting from spam but

199
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,660
the spam didn't stop and the people that

200
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:06,449
are sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> that spam and really the</font>

ultimate profit ears behind spam made

202
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:13,579
just as much money in 2008 as if you

203
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:16,559
guys had done nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand</font>

205
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:23,189
anymore because they are scattered

206
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:25,170
across four continents and they show up

207
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:30,689
they are much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile than they were</font>

208
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:32,399
before they have better systems of

00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:34,529
working through intermediaries than they

210
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,720
had before they are no longer sitting

211
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:40,259
ducks and you can no longer set up any

212

packet trace to say gee if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get a DNS</font>

transactions from that address space

00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:52,559
they got better as a result of what you

did you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not benefit from what you</font>

our costs are now higher as far as

00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,530
coping with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to do</font>

of these things are forged is because in

240
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,650
the early days of spam people put<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

sorts of filters on their inbound mail

or on transiting mail and said gee if

something claims to be coming to me it

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,930
overshoot on that the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> being that</font>

259
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,829
every one of those small incremental

260
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:56,339
step functions in spam filtering

261
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,709
educated the bad guys you

262
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,600
taught them that if they wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach</font>

263
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:04,859
a large audience they had to forge

264
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,860
certain things and I guess that's okay i

265
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,600
mean it's inevitable that people will do

266
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,759
what they can and that the rest of the

267
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,209
population will adapt to what people can

268
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,800
do but you ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be feeling a little</font>

269
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit stupid if any one of you ever</font>

270
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,589
thought any filtering like this was ever

271
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:25,170
going to stop anything for very long

272
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:27,899
stopping spam for<font color="#E5E5E5"> today is not a virtue</font>

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:35,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need to do something a little more</font>

that you can read directly this is

276
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:43,860
intended really to summarize where I'm

277
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:49,920
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to at this point in my</font>

278
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:52,800
presentation you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't expect</font>

279
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,589
that the bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are not going to adapt</font>

280
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,990
to your behavior whatever you do becomes

281

the new starting conditions for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">round of the game so it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be the</font>

283
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,339
case that you'll figure something out

284
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:06,809
that will cause them to become aware

285
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,149
that you don't want them to do something

286
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:10,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they'll get the hint and go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away and</font>

287
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,600
they'll say well they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want me to</font>

288
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:16,379
do that I better stop that's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

289
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:19,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it works furthermore these incremental</font>

290
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:23,730
step functions are an educational tool

291
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:25,980
the community that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in conflict</font>

292
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,929
with in other words people who want to

293
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,220
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your networks and your computers in</font>

294
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:35,970
ways that don't meet with your approval

295
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:39,959
are getting free training from you and

296
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,939
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of a very natural side</font>

297
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:45,410
effect of what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing to protect</font>

298
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:45,410
yourself on a daily basis

299
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:52,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to drive home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point</font>

300
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:56,430
the things that we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the name of</font>

301
00:14:52,770 --> 00:15:00,600
cost control are not actually helping us

302
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:07,560
with cost control in the long run or

303
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:10,970
doing any other long-term good so I want

304
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:14,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about configure there's no L I</font>

305
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:19,110
fairly often mispronounced it by calling

306
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:22,470
it come flickr<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no L this is a</font>

307
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:25,230
tweet<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came out fairly early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

308
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:35,090
after a press release that the configure

309
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:35,090
working group did and I just want to say

310
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:42,030
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do press release we had to let</font>

311
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:45,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world know that there was this thing</font>

312
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:50,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it was out there but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was</font>

313
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:52,709
some organized opposition to it and the

314
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:56,160
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> money that was in the configure</font>

315
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:59,070
working group was marketing budgets from

316
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,740
security companies or volunteer efforts

317
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:06,390
from some extremely talented dedicated

318
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:08,700
people who let their day jobs swing in

319
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:12,960
the breeze while they go and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

320
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,610
fight this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fire so we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

321
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,790
do a press release because that was the

322
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">reward that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the companies who were</font>

323
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:22,319
allowing their people to work on this

324
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,960
needed in order to then justify the

325
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,760
expense because it wasn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

326
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:31,920
profit-making activity fighting these

327
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:34,050
worms and so forth is is a dead loss but

328
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,310
the natural result was fair number of

329
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:40,170
folks said you guys are just saying the

330
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,170
sky is<font color="#CCCCCC"> falling but it isn't nearly that</font>

331
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:47,160
bad why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you bringing the alarm bells</font>

332
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,349
quite so loudly I heard the same thing

333
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,480
when

334
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:54,860
dan kaminsky released his DNS

335
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,020
vulnerability last year folks kept

336
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,050
saying hey I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't see</font>

337
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the problem warrants the attention</font>

338
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,469
that you're giving it or the press

339
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:08,810
releases or the press conferences or

340
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:13,190
whatever I have stopped worrying about

341
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:16,190
this I think I don't know six seven

342
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:19,250
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I got up here and told you all</font>

343
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:21,050
about the importance of bcp 38 and a

344
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,000
fair number who said I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing any</font>

345
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,829
spoof source addresses and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D doses</font>

346
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,339
that are reaching me so why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

347
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:30,409
ringing his alarm bells well check<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

348
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,790
maybe you're seeing them now maybe if

349
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">you had done something then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

350
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,090
not be seeing them or somebody else

351
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,760
would not be seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> them now so I don't</font>

352
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:41,870
worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the the folks who who claim</font>

353
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are overstating the dangers some</font>

354
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,879
people do however and it gets to be a

355
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,200
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard sometimes to get companies</font>

356
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,670
to participate if they know they're

357
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be ridiculed for their for</font>

358
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:57,320
their trouble but some forms of ridicule

359
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,449
or more entertaining than others oh crap

360
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:03,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">configure just ate my puppy hide your</font>

361
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:07,670
women and internets look out yeah I was

362
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:10,220
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we can speculate</font>

363
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,970
about whether the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> would have</font>

364
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:16,460
been much worse had we not acted whether

365
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,560
the whatever small amount of patching

366
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:24,110
we've had would have been even lower if

367
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:25,850
we had not rang the alarm bells so there

368
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,219
will always be people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that the</font>

369
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:34,070
problem is not as bad as as we're

370
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:37,090
claiming they will usually be wrong so

371
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,090
the day of the press<font color="#E5E5E5"> release</font>

372
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,678
somebody who is able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monitor the</font>

373
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:48,449
creation of new domain names noted these

374
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:51,450
and various people who were<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

375
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,190
configure working group said gee I have

376
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,440
a theory about how it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the bad</font>

377
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:58,919
guys might register some of this in

378
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to then feed people malware under</font>

379
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:05,460
the guise of having it somehow clean

380
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:08,480
their systems so every one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these was</font>

381
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,580
carefully looked at find out if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

382
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,289
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some legitimate well known</font>

383
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,389
security company or whether it was some

384
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:19,830
fly-by-night outfit or whether it was

385
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:22,168
actual honest-to-god bad where I see

386
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:27,600
that the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one has an L in it which I</font>

387
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:31,169
thought was interesting we then listed

388
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:34,918
them on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website that was the configure</font>

389
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:36,330
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups website and recommended</font>

390
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,570
that people not visit these sites

391
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,769
because they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know somehow not</font>

392
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,990
part of the effort they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

393
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:44,580
official and they might be bad and say

394
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,830
that they were bad because the number of

395
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,299
us in the working group had been sued

396
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:53,639
enough times to know better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font>

397
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:57,090
but some of the fly-by-night people got

398
00:19:53,639 --> 00:20:01,279
pretty outraged at us for outing them in

399
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:03,509
this way now it's interesting to note

400
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,299
this guy says he's gone to a lot of

401
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:07,769
trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> this week to build a site I</font>

402
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:11,840
don't know how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble you can go</font>

403
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:15,029
to in a week those of us who had been

404
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,850
not sleeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the last month and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

405
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,919
half and you know away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our families</font>

406
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so forth might have looked at this</font>

407
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,700
and said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you put a week into</font>

408
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:27,210
this exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how does this give</font>

409
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:30,870
you whining rights but what I found

410
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:33,779
interesting was that anything like this

411
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,820
with it brings public attention to some

412
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:38,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known name becomes a business</font>

413
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,908
opportunity for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

414
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,950
have no real value to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add but the</font>

415
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:47,509
do want to sell some advertising or get

416
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:50,840
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> click throughs or whatever and the</font>

417
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:52,429
bad guys can count on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this the extent</font>

418
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,320
that they need a strategy in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font>

419
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,960
win<font color="#E5E5E5"> which really they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't but to the</font>

420
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,749
extent that they needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

421
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,039
and make a plan they could plan on this

422
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:09,529
type of friendly fire to confuse any

423
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:12,440
remediation effort you can look at the

424
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:14,359
list and imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some of those are</font>

425
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to show up when people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say oh I've</font>

426
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:18,199
heard about configure I wonder if I'm

427
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:23,539
infected I better do a search I better

429
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:31,009
were bad some of these actually we're

430
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:33,259
putting pop-ups<font color="#E5E5E5"> and key loggers and</font>

things on your computer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are honest</font>

432
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:38,649
to god malware you can't argue about it

433
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:46,879
most of them were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> people wanting to</font>

434
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:49,158
monetize the problem it's this this is a

00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:50,959
drag on the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

436
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,759
do about it this is human nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

437
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,039
what we will do in an open system that

438
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,529
allows people to rich register these

439
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:03,139
names and do I guess what's called

440
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:05,899
search engine optimization but it sure

441
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:09,349
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell doesn't make solving the real</font>

442
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:11,599
problem and easier a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these sites</font>

443
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:14,269
by the way had plenty of Microsoft

444
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,960
Partner logos on them and some of them

445
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,960
were accurate

446
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:29,820
so one of us made the observation that

447
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:32,549
since configure used encryption in its

448
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:36,240
command channel that made<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very</font>

449
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:38,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult for us to send it commands</font>

450
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would shut it down or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D install</font>

451
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,909
itself not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that anybody has figured out</font>

452
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:48,059
a legal way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that but nevertheless</font>

453
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:50,250
this is a botnet that was operating in

454
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,799
the open that had enough encryption

455
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,750
built into it that they could keep good

456
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,780
guys were other bad guys from taking it

457
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:00,480
away from them which i thought was

458
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:02,160
impressive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows that a lot of</font>

459
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">evolution and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of training has</font>

460
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,760
occurred on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that side of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wall so</font>

461
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,190
anyway one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us could have been a well</font>

462
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,970
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was me made the suggestion</font>

463
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:17,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when some door was finally kicked</font>

464
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,340
in and somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> was finally put in</font>

465
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,949
handcuffs and their pc was carted away

466
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:27,360
that the possession of this encryption

467
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:31,799
key would seal their fate<font color="#E5E5E5"> would really</font>

468
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:35,159
prove their guilt and this was this was

469
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> result</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell that a lot of</font>

470
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">people were not sleeping very much</font>

471
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,520
during during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this went on</font>

472
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:52,320
one fella made a really excellent set of

473
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:56,430
tools for detecting that you were

474
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,080
infected because it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the one</font>

475
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,640
side effect of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the infection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you</font>

476
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,560
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> not visit certain websites</font>

477
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,290
therefore he came up with a website that

478
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,790
just had those websites as clickable are

479
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:09,270
not even clickable so they it was

480
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:13,139
fetching images from them and it was

481
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:15,330
like I don't know it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> as cool to me</font>

482
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,300
as the first time I saw a traceroute and

483
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,919
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the IP TTL field could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

484
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,600
used in that way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like it was</font>

485
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,610
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front of us and why</font>

486
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,320
didn't I think of this kind of thing but

487
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:28,580
it turned out that the companies whose

488
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,750
logos were being fetched were not

489
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:36,350
universally pleased to be associated

490
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this effort I don't know if this is</font>

491
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:42,780
seems important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to anybody who isn't me</font>

492
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:46,140
but if you're in a struggle<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conflict</font>

493
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,430
with somebody it was opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and</font>

494
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,260
they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> something you don't want them</font>

495
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,550
to have or they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

496
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,160
don't want them to do or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

497
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:56,240
going to be if you have costs they don't

498
00:24:53,160 --> 00:25:00,600
have it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult for you to them</font>

499
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,280
win the struggle so interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> why I</font>

500
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,560
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I looked at this and I said I</font>

501
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,450
wonder if the bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have got lawyers</font>

502
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:10,080
who ever tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they shouldn't</font>

503
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:12,210
do something and you know I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

504
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,120
we shouldn't have lawyers I'm saying are

505
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">we aware that when we burden ourselves</font>

506
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,550
with all the different things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we burden</font>

507
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,460
ourselves with we are tying our hands

508
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're sort of adding an extra sack</font>

509
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,110
of rocks to their to the backpack before

510
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,409
we try to beat somebody at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of</font>

511
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,409
the hill

512
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,720
during the last couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of months it's</font>

513
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:43,800
been a lot of fighting all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font>

514
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:49,110
world I was fell out of my chair with

515
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:51,210
disbelief and concern when the Pakistan

516
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,209
government entered into a peace

517
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:57,090
agreement with some armed militants

518
00:25:53,210 --> 00:26:00,000
allowing a change in federal

519
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:03,030
constitutional law and protections a

520
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,020
thereof for a disputed region of their

521
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:09,090
own country<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I thought what message</font>

522
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,090
does this send to the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> person who</font>

523
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">was unhappy with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rule of law now</font>

524
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:15,510
turned out I need not have been

525
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,260
concerned because within a week the

526
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:24,480
fighting had resumed but what this

527
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:28,680
reminded me of was<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if somebody</font>

528
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">is in an armed struggle against you you</font>

529
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,580
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the option of negotiating with</font>

530
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,230
them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sayings yeah I hate the armed</font>

531
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,610
struggle can't we find a way to get

532
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:43,440
along I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing in a country that was</font>

533
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:44,939
founded exactly that way maybe the

534
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,120
winners write the history books but

535
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:51,930
indeed you can shoulder<font color="#CCCCCC"> your way into</font>

536
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:54,449
somebody else's game if you can drive

537
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,490
their costs up high enough that they

538
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:02,190
would see peace with you as preferable

539
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:03,810
to ongoing ongoing fighting you can do

540
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,330
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you can get away with it</font>

541
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:08,280
then I guess that's fine if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font>

542
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:13,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">then they call you a criminal and if you</font>

543
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:16,470
can they<font color="#E5E5E5"> call you a revolutionary but I</font>

544
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:20,760
think

545
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:23,580
that the credit card banks credit card

546
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:27,929
companies and the banks who clear those

547
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:32,340
transactions have budgeted some billions

548
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:37,130
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Abby</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> per year for loss</font>

549
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:39,299
and fraud and they do this because

550
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,039
they're you know they do everything they

551
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:43,980
can they'll call you if you start making

552
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,750
if your card is used in some City you

553
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">have never visited or whatever it is and</font>

554
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:52,860
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a fair amount of protection</font>

555
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:56,130
but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you know</font>

556
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:59,370
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money gets moved around</font>

557
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:00,929
that is not yours or<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be yours</font>

558
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:06,178
before it got moved out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your account</font>

559
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:08,370
or whatever the banks often will

560
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:11,600
reimburse their customers for those

561
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,918
losses and they have a budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

562
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,629
have insurance for this they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

563
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,480
kinds of money that they set<font color="#CCCCCC"> aside in</font>

564
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:20,190
order to cover the parts of the security

problem that they can't solve on the

566
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:29,850

bad guys as entrepreneurs who see that

pile<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money they know it's there and</font>

621
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:15,510
amazingly efficient they have clearing

channels they have all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font>

624
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,560
sometimes they're poorly organized and

only among people who know each other by

the kind that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have with well should</font>

00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:01,470
we do a press release or well with this

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:14,760
how much of our superior forces are

645
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:18,590
dissipated in just coalition management

646

the bad guys don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do</font>

647
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:28,359
I could have quoted this from Anna's

an interesting traffic from IP address

653
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:44,769
Dustin so what does anybody know

654
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:46,809
anything and then four or five people

655
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:49,929
will send a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is just like</font>

656
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:53,379
this one nothing exciting here sorry and

657
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:55,599
I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if the person you're</font>

658
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:58,359
who has the information isn't on the

659
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:01,149
mailing lists that you asked on what if

they're on<font color="#CCCCCC"> vacation what if it's a whole</font>

effective way to find out what other

that particular IP address this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

that the person who sent this reply was

either a passionate volunteer who was

letting their day jobs swing in the

681
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:15,909
where this actually did any good which I

682
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:18,339
think I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't in the long term</font>

00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:20,679
in no case that it does do any good will

684
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:22,779
it do any lasting good because all those

685
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,059
people will move on there is no

686
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:27,569
organized system for answering questions

687
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,569
of this kind

688
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:43,190
so configure here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> L again configure</font>

689
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:45,939
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> its I guess marshaling they</font>

690
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:48,620
marshaled the botnet around the idea of

691
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:52,159
domain names which they would compute

692
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:54,859
sort of along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lines of a hash chain</font>

693
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,399
a long list of random names that each

694
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,650
one was related to the one before that

695
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:06,110
meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they could use the current</font>

696
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:08,510
date to generate some names and they

697
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:12,200
would then every bot would look up those

698
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:14,270
names to find out if it could fetch the

699
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,600
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of the of the botnet binary</font>

700
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:19,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the malware from that website and</font>

701
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,040
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> that binary had to be</font>

702
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,900
cryptographically signed and somebody

703
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,680
told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's a pretty long key so</font>

704
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:31,040
likelihood of us guessing that or

705
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:36,549
reconstructing that key real low on the

706
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:41,270
first version used 250 names per day

707
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:43,370
which we the people who wanted to

708
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:47,360
respond to this and keep the botnet

709
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:50,810
under control said well 250 names a day

710
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:53,030
is is a lot that's that's hard but

711
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,560
various people and here I if I was

712
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:57,790
wearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hat I would take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it off to</font>

00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:07,070
just paid is bought them<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's bought the</font>

715
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:08,600
damn domains and so you know various

716
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,850
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people also chipped in and bought</font>

717
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,500
some domains and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> even somewhat</font>

718
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,120
useful if you could buy those domains

719
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,470
there's a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a market in those</font>

720
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,970
domains in fact a little bit of

721
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,879
competition as to who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to get</font>

722
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:22,459
them because if you could register the

723
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,140
domains then all the botnets<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

724
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,210
bots in the botnet would be contacting

725
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,560
your server and you could then get a

726
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,730
list of the IP addresses that were

727
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:33,799
infected in that particular hour and

728
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,099
then somehow you would use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

729
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,809
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how you would you</font>

730
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:44,369
but it was considered good to have so

731
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:45,989
the operators of this botnet still have

732
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,279
their original infection vector

733
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:50,839
available to them which was a

734
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:53,849
combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of drive-by downloads and</font>

735
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:57,359
for whatever reason USB keys were part

736
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:59,700
of the infection vector also boot blocks

737
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,288
and so forth the operating system would

738
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,439
load automatically so they had their

739
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:06,359
original infection vector still

740
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,489
available to them when we started

741
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:10,799
responding to them by essentially

742
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:14,880
camping on to all of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> names so the</font>

743
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">next version used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 thousand names per</font>

744
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:24,390
day and that was them more or less

745
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,960
challenging us to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy them go see if</font>

746
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,879
we're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay that much of you</font>

747
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,839
know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wholesale cost is five</font>

can stepped up and put us in<font color="#CCCCCC"> touch with</font>

750
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,910
all of the different top-level domain

751
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:46,549
there were a hundred and ten country

752
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:49,979
codes that were involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this and</font>

753
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:52,650
several of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> have got second-level</font>

754
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:54,749
domains like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if UK was on</font>

755
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,940
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine that co</font>

756
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:59,488
uk is where the registrations would have

757
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:02,789
occurred so there were 116 different

758
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:06,029
domain names that were used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as</font>

759
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:09,719
parents for these random names and we

760
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:12,210
had a month to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in touch with 110</font>

761
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:15,509
countries that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for</font>

762
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:17,670
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> 116 domain names and I threw in</font>

763
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:20,160
the towel I gotta say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just looked at</font>

764
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:22,380
that and said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we lost all right way</font>

765
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,529
the first round we won in the second

766
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,809
round we lost and so it goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

767
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:29,249
that sometimes this is hard for some of

768
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:34,170
you to believe sometimes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't drink</font>

769
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:37,410
enough coffee this was done between I

770
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:40,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">cam and various members of the configure</font>

771
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:41,430
working group and phone calls and plane

772
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,280
tickets and email

773
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:46,890
and so forth all of the affected country

774
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,900
codes agreed to participate by either

775
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,460
registering the names and pointing them

776
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,230
at our name servers so that we could

777
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,930
collect information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the botnets or</font>

778
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,280
by blocking the names and flagging them

779
00:38:54,930 --> 00:39:01,348
so that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody tried to register</font>

780
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:03,359
them you could we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> know immediately</font>

781
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:05,640
who it was and what stolen credit card

782
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,700
they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and you know perhaps send</font>

783
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:12,390
people over to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kick their doors in and</font>

784
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:15,689
shackle them so that was huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

785
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:18,240
impressed and I have I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always</font>

786
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:19,740
had wonderful things to say about I<font color="#E5E5E5"> cam</font>

787
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,450
and during their history of and I will

788
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,270
say they really stepped up and did some

789
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:28,558
good things by coordinating that part of

790
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:31,500
the effort anyway the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next part of the</font>

791
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,660
game therefore got to be well we better

792
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,119
look at every<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> names every</font>

793
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:38,790
day not only today's names but names for

794
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:42,030
the next week and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that some</font>

795
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:44,250
bad guy hasn't camped on<font color="#E5E5E5"> 21 early in a</font>

796
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,380
way that all they have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is wait</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

797
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the clock to tick over to that point and</font>

798
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,280
all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden they will get control of</font>

799
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:53,099
their of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their botnet we're talking</font>

800
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:57,349
about half a<font color="#E5E5E5"> million to a million to a</font>

801
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:59,819
million and a half infected computers so

802
00:39:57,349 --> 00:40:02,910
certainly it's one of the biggest single

803
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:06,690
botnets that has ever hit the papers and

804
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:09,029
it was in our opinion those of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

805
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:12,180
worked on this it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important it</font>

806
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:14,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">was really crucial to keep the bad guys</font>

807
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:19,348
from getting full control over this this

808
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:24,650
net so a lot of mail messages like the

809
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:27,329
one on the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> now came about said</font>

810
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:29,160
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some pre-existing domains what</font>

811
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:31,319
are we going to do about them and what

812
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that meant was somebody already had the</font>

813
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:37,710
random string that configure was going

814
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,750
to choose for a certain day and we would

815
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:42,289
then do a lot of work looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

816
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:44,179
website looking to see how

817
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:45,859
ago was this registered we figured if it

818
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:48,529
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> registered two years ago it couldn't</font>

819
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:51,709
be part of the current effort eventually

820
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:53,929
we found a couple that were insecure SQL

821
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:55,428
injection and so forth so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that even</font>

822
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:57,799
though they were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> old they were</font>

823
00:40:55,429 --> 00:41:00,019
subject to having malware inserted into

824
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:02,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the website in the place that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the binary</font>

825
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:06,589
of the malware would then go look for it

826
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:07,729
so you know what you're supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

827
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,709
the image you're supposed to have in

828
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:11,989
your in your head looking at the this

829
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:13,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular quote on the screen is a</font>

831
00:41:13,969 --> 00:41:23,900
on fire for months a fair number of what

832
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:26,029
we found were other good guys and this

833
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,009
was our way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting them in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

834

836
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:34,879
able to say by the way the name server

837
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,469
I'm using when I capture one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

838
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">names is as follows and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you could</font>

00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:40,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of cross them off the list but if</font>

840
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:42,829
you found one that was registered

841
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:46,339
recently to a name server that was not

842
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:48,229
on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> so called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whitelist then it was</font>

843
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:50,089
like oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> goodness the bad guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

844
00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:52,399

846
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,439
often turned out that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't true</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">or in the case that's on the screen</font>

other good guys that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we met by seeing</font>

856
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:18,589
their queries picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the phone and</font>

857
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,329
discovering that they had a contract

858
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:22,819
with some government somewhere to go

859
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:25,339
measure the size of this or go go do

860
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:27,890
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on it so I guess there was a</font>

861
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:29,719
good side benefit that we got a chance

862
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:31,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to meet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

863
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:34,549
like-minded that we had no no ties with

864
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:37,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">before this but it also meant that we</font>

865
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:42,489
had a lot of administrative paperwork to

866
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:42,489
be done Todd how am i doing on time

867
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:50,170
and this is an administrative burden

868
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,170
that the bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly don't have</font>

869
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:59,000
this came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot there were so many</font>

870
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,250
people dumping so much information into

871
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> various mailing lists where this was</font>

872
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:08,119
taking place that the discussions that

873
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">debates the philosophic rantings usually</font>

874
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:14,780
from me and the reports became sometimes

875
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,640
hundreds of messages a day and a number

876
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people said can you please take this</font>

877
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,420
cut it up on the Nano I'm an analyst

878
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,730
fairly often also<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you please take</font>

879
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,490
this to another list so that i can read

880
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:27,619
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the part that's important to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me at</font>

881
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,750
last count<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are seven such sub</font>

882
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:32,990
lists all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them have too much traffic</font>

883
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:35,300
on them again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder if the</font>

884
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,500
bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anything like this burden</font>

885
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:43,430
when they are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to launch one of</font>

886
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:47,599
these attacks so a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

887
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:50,089
companies who was involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this all</font>

888
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,250
have to do sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of follow up press</font>

889
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:53,960
releases and<font color="#E5E5E5"> blog postings and things</font>

890
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:57,589
like that talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about various things</font>

891
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">and again it's because sure generally it</font>

892
00:43:57,589 --> 00:44:02,089
is the marketing arm of these companies

893
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:03,830
when they are fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a botnet they are</font>

894
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:07,339
not serving their customers directly

895
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:11,950
they are serving their shareholders and

896
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:14,210
so you know dancing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with who brung ya</font>

897
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:16,279
meant that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people had to</font>

898
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:18,200
disclose a lot of stuff and then there

899
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,390
would be this fight that would happen

900
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,220
internally why did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> close that</font>

901
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,259
now the bad guys know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know it</font>

902
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,310
and other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would say well it's</font>

903
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:31,670
obvious that we know it and so forth on

904
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:34,339
I guess cooperation is hard to come by

905
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:36,829
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there isn't you know fire raging</font>

906
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:40,089
at your feet but

907
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:46,519
I keep asking myself as I go through

908
00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:48,979
this year is this a cost that only we on

909
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:51,319
our side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the wall have to pay or are</font>

910
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:52,759
the bad guys paying a similar cost this

911
00:44:51,319 --> 00:45:00,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be one where the answer would be</font>

912
00:44:52,759 --> 00:45:03,559
no here's a question do bad guys cancel

913
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:09,640
their meetings because it's a holiday in

914
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:09,640
the United States bad guys take holidays

915
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:19,459
so this may come as a shock but not all

916
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:23,029
country code TLD registries are as big

917
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:25,368
as co uk right a lot of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

918
00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:28,309
at nama net and you know that they're

919
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:29,959
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a couple dozen</font>

920
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,789
employees and they probably don't worry

921
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:33,859
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the administrative expense of</font>

922
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:36,019
registering a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of names like this</font>

923
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:38,299
or blocking them or whatever but a lot

924
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:40,788
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are smaller than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and you</font>

925
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:42,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell them they got a their share of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 50</font>

926
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:45,949
thousand names per day is whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

927
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:48,259
going to be a thousand names or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500</font>

928
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:52,219
names that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have to just keep doing</font>

929
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:54,170
that in perpetuity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that they have to</font>

930
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:55,819
bear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and nobody is going to</font>

931
00:45:54,170 --> 00:46:01,519
help them pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it and some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

932
00:45:55,819 --> 00:46:04,788
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to squawk now I'm pleased to</font>

933
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:07,578
say that the the quote that's on your

934
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:09,589
screen right now is somebody's opinion

935
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:11,390
and they turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to be wrong in this</font>

936
00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:14,869
case the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who was wrong was not me</font>

937
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:16,879
all those and fairly often it is nobody

938
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:19,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">has dropped out there are some people</font>

939
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">who have there's some ccTLDs who have</font>

940
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:23,299
switched over from registering the names

941
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:24,859
and pointing them at our name servers to

942
00:46:23,299 --> 00:46:27,079
just blocking them because that's

943
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:31,819
cheaper for them but nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has said I</font>

944
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:34,369
refuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue so apparently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

945
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:38,619
belief that this is an important

946
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:42,220
containment effort is still shared by

947
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:44,170
of them I wonder what will happen when

948
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:47,379
this becomes the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> fad and there are</font>

949
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:51,430
10 new worms a month that all use this

950
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:53,740
particular technique very easy to launch

951
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:56,769
this attack very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to defend</font>

952
00:46:53,740 --> 00:47:04,660
against it so you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at an</font>

953
00:46:56,769 --> 00:47:10,180
asymmetric cost in scenario so here's a

954
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:12,578
guy who is stunningly good at tools and

955
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:19,269
operations and understanding protocols

956
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:21,789
and has had many thoughts about sort of

957
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:26,589
how to analyze data on how to organize

958
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:28,089
data and so forth and he was talking in

959
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:29,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">this particular instance about some</font>

960
00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:32,230
scripts that he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> written that we're</font>

961
00:47:29,529 --> 00:47:37,210
doing various amalgamation of

962
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:40,329
information and what he said is I would

963
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to solve fifty percent of the</font>

964
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:45,539
outstanding problems in the analysis the

965
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:49,569
rest of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing if I had time and</font>

966
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:51,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who's when they</font>

967
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:53,019
make a statement like that you say yeah

968
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:55,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah no this guy really could do it</font>

969
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:57,848
except he has already taken as he's let

970
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,680
his day job swing in the breeze as long

971
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:03,369
as he can he's not funded to do this

972
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:06,160
work and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point you do</font>

973
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:07,839
have to dance with who brung ya and work

974
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,109
for your paycheck or spend time with

975
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:14,410
your family<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whatever and our key men</font>

976
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:17,499
key women are key people tend to be

977
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:21,788
pretty well committed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of other</font>

978
00:48:17,499 --> 00:48:24,868
projects besides helping us I wonder if

979
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:24,869
the bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that problem</font>

980
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:33,019
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got into it with somebody on the</font>

981
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:36,738
more general problem of takedowns from

982
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:37,758
ccTLDs for phishing sites or you know

983
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:39,049
whatever it's going to be a lot of

984
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:41,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">people like to worry about child</font>

985
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:43,309
pornography because that just about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

986
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,279
only thing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web that is illegal</font>

987
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:48,049
everywhere but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter if</font>

988
00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:50,029
there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> website somewhere that can</font>

989
00:48:48,049 --> 00:48:51,739
only exist as long as a name certain

990
00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:55,039
domain name exists and you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

991
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:56,719
able to go to somebody and say look

992
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,339
you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge of the parent domain</font>

993
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:01,369
could you please remove the one that is

994
00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:03,049
bothering<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and not only is it</font>

995
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:04,819
important to be able to do this you have

996
00:49:03,049 --> 00:49:08,059
to do it at any time<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> night</font>

997
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:10,419
and they need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to go look at</font>

998
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:13,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it as a determination and</font>

999
00:49:10,419 --> 00:49:14,839
take an action at<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time of the day or</font>

1000
00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:18,229
night<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't let this wait until</font>

1001
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:22,578
Monday because<font color="#E5E5E5"> by that time often the</font>

1002
00:49:18,229 --> 00:49:24,859
entire campaign is over and this guy

1003
00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:27,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided that it was time for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me to learn</font>

1004
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:29,299
the facts of life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said no that</font>

1005
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:33,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">isn't going to happen it's not realistic</font>

1006
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:38,269
can't be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be done nothing to</font>

1007
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:40,339
see here move along and obviously the

1008
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:41,928
jury is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on this we don't know</font>

1009
00:49:40,339 --> 00:49:45,199
whether the opinion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your screen is</font>

1010
00:49:41,929 --> 00:49:48,829
correct or not I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight it for a</font>

1011
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:51,229
while but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to say that anything</font>

1012
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:52,819
that depends on instant takedowns is

1013
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:56,149
already very difficult in a commercial

1014
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:59,989
environment once you add national

1015
00:49:56,149 --> 00:50:02,659
autonomy to the mix then you're really

1016
00:49:59,989 --> 00:50:05,059
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pushing on a rope to get any</font>

1017
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:08,109
response ever let alone to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> one at</font>

1018
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:08,109
any time<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day or night</font>

1019
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:16,299
and this again is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the bad</font>

1020
00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:19,288
guys know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and so they are kind</font>

1021
00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:29,890
of building their whole campaigns around

1022
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:34,809
the things we can't do so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

1023
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:37,359
book The Art of War often quoted it's a

1024
00:50:34,809 --> 00:50:40,929
terribly short book you can read most

1025
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:43,288
translations in about two hours a fair

1026
00:50:40,929 --> 00:50:45,849
amount of it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a lot of sense</font>

1027
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:50,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it will talk about ancient</font>

1028
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:54,279
warfare using you know metrics that

1029
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:57,160
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't apply here but it is still</font>

1030
00:50:54,279 --> 00:51:00,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">taught and war colleges all over the</font>

1031
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:04,029
world because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parts that are still</font>

1032
00:51:00,189 --> 00:51:05,919
applicable are extremely applicable so

1033
00:51:04,029 --> 00:51:07,869
again you can read the thing in a couple

1034
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:12,549
of hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it will take a lifetime to</font>

1035
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:16,150
understand it and there are some things

1036
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:17,829
in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to be looking through</font>

1037
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:21,189
it for other reasons and I happen to

1038
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:24,819
notice G here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that the bad</font>

1039
00:51:21,189 --> 00:51:26,439
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing that we can't do I'm not</font>

1040
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:30,339
saying the bad guys looked at this and

1041
00:51:26,439 --> 00:51:33,098
said gee what a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea let's let's</font>

1042
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:35,919
align our campaigns around the the ideas

1043
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:39,159
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the art of war I'm saying that the</font>

1044
00:51:35,919 --> 00:51:42,308
stuff that is killing<font color="#E5E5E5"> us has been pretty</font>

1045
00:51:39,159 --> 00:51:44,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">well known for thousands of years you're</font>

1046
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:50,890
not you're not being killed by rocket

1047
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:53,859
scientists here this is not a war we are

1048
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:58,538
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> states we are not</font>

1049
00:51:53,859 --> 00:52:01,179
generals and armies so you have to sort

1050
00:51:58,539 --> 00:52:05,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">of see past the sum of the nouns that</font>

1051
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:10,989
are used and look at the actual force

1052
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:13,719
vectors behind these equations I don't

1053
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:15,690
know what exactly to call this it isn't

1054
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">a war</font>

1055
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:25,330
I'll get back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later but</font>

1056
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:27,549
it's a mouthful so I'm not going to read

1057
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:32,560
these just leave them on the screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1058
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:36,460
a moment and say there are some people

1059
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:39,009
who run the honeynet alliance that are

1060
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:43,480
our heroes of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they practice</font>

1061
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:46,570
this particular type of deception the

1062
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:51,070
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us don't the rest of us are</font>

1063
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:52,690
sitting ducks any of you who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has sort of</font>

1064
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:55,270
just had to stand there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it and</font>

1065
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">go toe-to-toe with addie das for days or</font>

1066
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:59,410
weeks on end who knows pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much what</font>

1067
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean there's no deception open to us</font>

1068
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:06,339
when we're trying to win any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1069
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:10,180
minor skirmishes that are in the long

1070
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:12,370
conflict that we're in but this stuff

1071
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:14,620
here is the bad guys get to do this

1072
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">every day all day back they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do</font>

1073
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:22,480
this because they are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the superior</font>

1074
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:25,990
force so

1075
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:29,230
when we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose I don't want to say</font>

1076
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:31,959
that we win but whenever but on a day

1077
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:33,880
that we didn't lose do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to take</font>

1078
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,270
anything away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a way with us that</font>

1079
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,610
will help us be stronger in the next

1080
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:43,750
conflict I would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer for</font>

1081
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:45,370
us is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> but for the bad guys this talks</font>

1082
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:51,580
about chariots but i'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

1083
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:54,580
botnets they are using networks that we

1084
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:57,160
build and that we pay for the link when

1085
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:58,600
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay for the dark fiber and the</font>

1086
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:02,620
capital and everything else and their

1087
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:06,160
computers that we bought for our parents

1088
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:09,370
or our children<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever it's all our</font>

1089
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:13,690
stuff that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order to execute</font>

1090
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:16,000
their business model a very little stuff

1091
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:18,280
of their own the extent that they buy

1092
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,220
stuff it's expensive houses in the

1093
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:23,320
French Riviera or expensive Italian

1094
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:26,740
sports cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of what they do</font>

1095
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,960
they use our stuff for so this whole

1096
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:32,950
augmentation thing they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to do and we</font>

1097
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:37,810
don't makes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder exactly how long</font>

1098
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:40,089
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep doing that it's a whole</font>

1099
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:42,250
section in the art of war explaining

1100
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:44,080
sort of the bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that will happen</font>

1101
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:50,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you set yourself up for a</font>

1102
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:54,100
lengthy campaign our campaign is not

1103
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:57,400
only lengthy it is unending their

1104
00:54:54,100 --> 00:55:00,460
campaigns are very short so when

1105
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:02,530
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do something they will</font>

1106
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:04,840
assemble whatever team they need and

1107
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:06,760
whatever data and tools and so forth and

1108
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll buy whatever botnet or whatever</font>

1109
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,980
they need to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they will send</font>

1110
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:13,210
whatever spam or DDoS or they'll do

1111
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,920
whatever they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do and they'll</font>

1112
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:17,500
pass it on to the next person<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their</font>

1113
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,420
economic chain and then they're done

1114
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:23,980
turn off their computers and they go out

1115
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:28,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to dinner we just have to treat this as</font>

1116
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,320
the long war the unending war

1117
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:40,140
again I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to refer you to the loss</font>

1118
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:44,759
and fraud budgets of the banks and

1119
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:46,980
credit card companies if you can

1120
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,950
convince one of these companies that the

1121
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:53,820
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them is that they just</font>

1122
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:55,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">let some percentage of the money passing</font>

1123
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:58,590
through their system wind up in the

1124
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong hands and then refund that out of</font>

1125
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:04,140
some some other sort of general set

1126
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:07,140
aside then you can set up a permanent

1127
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:08,730
system where you just get paid over and

1128
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:11,310
over again for doing the same stuff over

1129
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:14,520
and over again reminds me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

1130
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:17,190
of NPR radio program I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1131
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:21,750
negotiating with pirates off the coast

1132
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:23,400
of Somalia where after a ship has taken

1133
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,590
then the insurance company calls up and

1134
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">they start talking about how much money</font>

1135
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to be in the suitcase full of</font>

1136

1138
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,589
about just getting through the current

1139
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:42,299
quarter except the way we've organized

1140

matters

1143
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:59,609
here I was made to consider once again

1144
00:56:56,069 --> 00:57:03,060
the quote from the configure discussions

1145
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:05,040
about round to its I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to it</font>

1146
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:08,730
once they get enough around<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its I can</font>

1147
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:12,569
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for you is often possible to</font>

1148
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:15,329
know how to win but not but they're not

1149
00:57:12,569 --> 00:57:18,180
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and we are very rarely</font>

1150
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:23,160
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the offensive I know of a couple of</font>

1151
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:26,270
offensive efforts where the thing the

1152
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:29,368
vulnerability that we are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1153
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:33,750
the need that these bad guys have to

1154
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:36,480
live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our society right if you're you</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to a rave somewhere and</font>

you're dancing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with somebody that you're</font>

00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:46,319
hoping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know take home with you</font>

00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:47,549
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they ask you and what do you do for</font>

1159
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,160
a living you're probably not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1160
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:52,349
say oh I sell child pornography on the

00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:56,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find something</font>

1163
00:57:56,369 --> 00:58:00,750
if everybody was out in the open if

1164
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:06,480
everything that everyone of these guys

1165
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:09,060
did was just stuck to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them then I</font>

1166
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,819
suspect that the allure of this type of

1167
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:14,339
crime will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower that's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1168
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:17,640
only only systemic vulnerability they

1169
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:20,549
have is their anonymity and so I know of

1170
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:23,400
some offensive efforts in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that area not</font>

1171
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:25,980
just spam house and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rock so list</font>

1172
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,319
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is excellent by the way but</font>

1173
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:32,550
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know more targeted than</font>

1174
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:35,520
that is what it would take but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even then</font>

1175
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:37,770
I'm not sure how this scales and if it's

1176
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,079
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only vulnerability that i have found</font>

1177
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:42,480
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't think of a way to exploit it</font>

1178
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,990
in a scalable fashion then we're pretty

1179
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:50,390
much still losing and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we</font>

1180
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:50,390
are systemically on the defensive

1181
00:58:55,810 --> 00:59:03,270
can anybody look at this and not CD dos

1182
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:03,270
I just

1183
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:15,450
we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to exploit this</font>

1184
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:18,210
advice the bad guys do and we like when

1185
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:20,640
we employ defenses to think of them as

1186
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:23,700
constants in other words i think i'll

1187
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,470
install clamavi or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

1188
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,109
it's going to be a firewall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

1189
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">go install that to protect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my network my</font>

1190
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:31,830
survey or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I'm going to</font>

1191
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:34,410
protect and then I'm going to move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1192
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:36,090
my next project and I am NOT going to

1193
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:39,359
come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this until it stops working</font>

1194
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:40,800
I am NOT going to continue fiddling with

1195
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:44,130
it forever because I would go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1196
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:46,470
business generally it takes the

1197
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:50,220
technically deepest people on the team

1198
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:53,220
to get any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff working or to</font>

1199
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:56,399
fiddle with it and if you're spending

1200
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:58,109
your salary budget in that way you're

1201
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,970
probably not going to last long you'll

1202
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:04,080
end up getting bought out by somebody

1203
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:08,810
who didn't do that so we like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> treat</font>

1204
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:12,000
our warfare as they call it here<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

1205
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:13,470
constant condition because that's the

1206
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,020
only thing that makes economic sense for

1207
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:17,759
us I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad guys are not</font>

1208
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,100
doing that they are treating everything

1209
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,600
we do as the next as the starting

1210
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,810
conditions for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next round in the</font>

1211
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,810
game

1212
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:34,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned this earlier the bad guys</font>

1213
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">have alliances they depend on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each other</font>

1214
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:40,809
but they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to trust each other</font>

1215
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,640
they can operate<font color="#E5E5E5"> between enough</font>

1216
01:00:40,809 --> 01:00:47,109
intermediaries and enough smoke screens

1217
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:49,779
that they are they're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend on</font>

1218
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:52,029
suppliers or to be dependent<font color="#CCCCCC"> on as a</font>

1219
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:54,099
supplier without having to first build

01:00:52,029 --> 01:00:55,269
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a trust network I don't have</font>

1221
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:56,739
to get to know each other they don't

1222
01:00:55,269 --> 01:00:59,078
care whether you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same side as</font>

1223
01:00:56,739 --> 01:01:00,700
long as you can do what you say you can

1224
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:02,460
do then you will get paid and they will

1225
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">get paid and everybody marches forward</font>

1226
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:07,660
we on the other hand have the burden of

1227
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:10,538
having to wonder gee are you a bad guy

1228

than I am about are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking me what I</font>

know about a certain topic how do i how

the system that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built using our</font>

1233
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:38,920
superior capability places us at a

01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:46,859
systemic disadvantage the system is

1235
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:52,960
broken to our detriment by us by design

1236
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:55,058
and I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I could have given this</font>

1237

talk other than the configure stuff I

01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:13,779
I don't rest easily when stuff is broken

1241
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,360
sometimes that's good right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now as of</font>

called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security information exchange</font>

approach I been involved in something

1276
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:52,960
called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC trust project where I</font>

1277
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,200
do some sis it min and once again some

1278
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:58,720
coding I know I should stop and I can't

1279
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:02,890
this is Barry green and John Kristoff

1280
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,689
and jose from arbor<font color="#CCCCCC"> jose nazario put</font>

1281
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:07,690
this together as a way to share

1282
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:11,829
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> among trusted parties</font>

1283
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:14,140
if you should if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that that's</font>

1284
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:16,839
interesting you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact jose or</font>

1285
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:19,529
berry or john and say hey that's

1286
01:04:16,839 --> 01:04:23,170
interesting can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow</font>

1287
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:25,060
I'm here I don't come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> nana very often</font>

1288
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:27,040
other than when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is co-located with</font>

1289
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:30,279
Aaron but I'm here thank you for

1290
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:33,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">inviting me I'm here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because this work</font>

1291
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:35,829
is important because the children in my

1292
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:38,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">family are going to grow up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a world</font>

1293
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:40,750
that has the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> damn problems that</font>

1294
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:42,220
we've got if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get on an airplane</font>

1295
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:46,390
once in a while and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and make a</font>

1296
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:48,939
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am also working on various</font>

1297
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:51,400
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get some funding I believe that</font>

1298
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:53,410
if we had some round to its that were

1299
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,869
dedicated rather than stolen from day

1300
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:58,569
jobs and families that the good guys

1301
01:04:55,869 --> 01:05:02,040
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of push the line</font>

1302
01:04:58,569 --> 01:05:02,040
of scrimmage back toward midfield

1303
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:07,890
obviously this is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font>

1304
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:15,810
if you're not running an abuse desk that

1305
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:18,270
responds 24 by 7 you're not

1306
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:21,150
disconnecting customers first and asking

1307
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:23,369
questions later you're part of the

1308
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:25,740
problem and you're shifting your costs

1309
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:32,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto your competitors are on to the</font>

1310
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:34,859
community you can't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because that</font>

1311
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:36,570
causes your competitors to have to do

1312
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:38,940
likewise in order to compete with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1313
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:41,550
and when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it your customers do</font>

1314
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:43,410
suffer you've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to get your head</font>

1315
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:45,359
out of the current quarter and look at

1316
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:49,589
the long-term pattern that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

1317
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:52,680
contributing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to when you outsource you</font>

1318
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:54,510
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have in-house expertise</font>

1319
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,310
and so you tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1320
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:59,720
mercy of the people the vendors that you

1321
01:05:56,310 --> 01:06:03,170
choose for your security you're also

1322
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:06,509
contributing to their monetary inertia

1323
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:09,300
in other words when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you buy security as</font>

1324
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:12,450
a service rather than hiring people to

1325
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:15,990
create it for you inside your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

1326
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:18,680
you are not incentivizing your vendors

1327
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:21,569
to make the problem go away permanently

1328
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:24,419
you're in sending them to manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1329
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:26,280
problem and look good doing it and

1330
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:31,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what that</font>

1331
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:35,040
means for you in the long term and<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

1332
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,770
but not least participation you're here

1333
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:39,540
I appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hell out of that fair</font>

1334
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:41,160
number of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have looked up from your</font>

01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,560
laptop several times during this

1336
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:45,540
presentation and that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll</font>

1337
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:52,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell everybody back home that it was a</font>

1338
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:54,000
rip-roaring success but you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

1339
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:57,750
that I am somehow going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve this</font>

1340
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,880
problem for you not only can I not do it

1341
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:02,460
without you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't actually do it we</font>

1342
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:05,220
need to have the whole community become

1343
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:09,690
more aware of these patterns and of our

1344
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:12,240
contributions to them so you should go

1345
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:15,309
find out if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sack</font>

1346
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:18,169
is you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably go find out</font>

1347
01:07:15,309 --> 01:07:20,390
if you know if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not on at least</font>

1348
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:22,400
three secret handshake mailing lists

1349
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:28,788
then you're under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> curve and you need</font>

1350
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:31,279
to go find some others and if I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1351
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:34,069
the call for funding in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this area in</font>

1352
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:36,920
order to aggregate some round to its i

1353
01:07:34,069 --> 01:07:39,940
will count on some of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to saying you</font>

1354
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,940
know gee that sounds interesting

1355
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:53,739
anybody want to queue up at the

1356
01:07:48,789 --> 01:07:56,739
microphone any questions I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1357
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:58,180
hook I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to moderate that</font>

1358

we have we have a few minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1359
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:03,808
questions so let's have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little round</font>

01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:03,809
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> applause while you all ponder</font>

company you work for tonight<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I am</font>

1365
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:23,269
Chris woodfield I'm with<font color="#CCCCCC"> internap um a</font>

1366
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:26,420
lot of the lot of the fundamental

1367
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:29,869
lessons I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself asking the</font>

1368
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:31,069
question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there what is fundamentally</font>

1369
01:08:29,868 --> 01:08:33,408
different or is there anything

1370
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:34,790
fundamentally different when it comes to

1371
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:38,509
the fact that we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

1372
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:41,299
internet and IT security compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

1373
01:08:38,509 --> 01:08:43,270
the struggles that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> banks go through</font>

1374
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:45,729
preventing credit card fraud or

1375
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:48,080
international drug interdiction agencies

1376
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:52,339
struggle with attempting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1377
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:54,049
stop the flow of illegal drugs is our

1378
01:08:52,339 --> 01:08:59,778
struggle fundamentally different from

1379
01:08:54,049 --> 01:09:03,969
their struggles in your opinion in my

1380
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:07,040
opinion no globalization<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that</font>

1381
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:09,830
borders are less and less important so

1382
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,448
just as with the Czar's scare of a

1383
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:12,830
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago nobody really cared</font>

1384
01:09:11,448 --> 01:09:15,710
that there was a border between Canada

1385
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:18,139
and the United States certainly the

1386
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:20,599
virus wasn't going to care crime doesn't

1387
01:09:18,139 --> 01:09:27,589
care whether it's drugs or phishing

1388
01:09:20,599 --> 01:09:29,150
attacks or whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fundamental</font>

1389
01:09:27,589 --> 01:09:31,278
difference as far as I'm concerned is

1390
01:09:29,149 --> 01:09:33,559
that I can't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those</font>

1391
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:36,619
other problems right but when it comes

1392
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:38,540
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us I'd like to</font>

1393
01:09:36,618 --> 01:09:39,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we can do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it it</font>

1394
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:43,009
may even be that if we do something

1395
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:45,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it that some of the tools that in</font>

1396
01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:48,198
infrastructure and techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1397
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,839
build will be useful in those other

1398
01:09:48,198 --> 01:09:52,759
areas the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet has often done things</font>

1399
01:09:50,839 --> 01:09:54,710
first and the rest of the world has

1400
01:09:52,759 --> 01:09:56,270
often learned from them that's the only

1401
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:57,830
fundamental difference is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1402
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:59,300
the one part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you said</font>

1403
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:03,210
that we in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room could do something</font>

1404
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:06,780
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> right Patrick</font>

1405
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:10,920
hi my name is Patrick think I'm from<font color="#CCCCCC"> och</font>

1406
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:13,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">my during the talk you said that if you</font>

1407
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,430
don't I'm paraphrasing it but if you

1408
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:17,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't shoot first and ask questions</font>

1409
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:20,370
later you're part of the problem and i

1410
01:10:17,489 --> 01:10:23,480
find that I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to expand upon</font>

1411
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:26,840
that because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font>

1412
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:29,450
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to justify as you know it</font>

1413
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:34,090
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the exact opposite problem</font>

1414
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:34,090
which can be just as<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if not worse so</font>

1415
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:39,610
expand a little bit on that part i would

1416
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:42,900
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the opposite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem can't scale</font>

1417
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:45,639
and that's the important thing to note

1418
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:51,339
but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get there what I'll say is</font>

1419
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:54,190
if you get a complaint about some

1420
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:56,200
illegal content or some maybe it's a

1421
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:58,900
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks exactly like PayPal</font>

1422
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,490
but isn't paypal and it's on some dsl

1423
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:03,460
connected computer that somebody's

1425
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:08,110
it's running an operating system that's

1426
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:11,200
vulnerable to various kinds of attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1427
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:13,389
think the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the abuse</font>

1428
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:15,250
desk needs to do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is push</font>

1429
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:19,780
the big red button that takes that thing

1430
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:21,610
off line and then contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subscriber</font>

1431
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:23,290
and say by the way there's a problem or

put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in a walled garden so that all</font>

a problem you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should not first stop and</font>

1439
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:43,980
look at your contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the person</font>

1440
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:46,630
who actually owns that code machine

1441
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:49,419
you've got to solve the problem first

1442
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:51,520
and then catch up to look up the

1443
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:55,000
paperwork catch up because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1444
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:58,390
let's say it that you're extremely good

1445
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,750
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know you're better</font>

1446
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:04,810
than good and that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the whole</font>

1447
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:06,220
process down to two hours the bad guys

01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:08,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">are going to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that two hours as</font>

their window that's their window they

1450
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:19,090
will adapt to what we do so if your

1451
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:20,769
abuse desk responds by saying here's a

1452

web form that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should fill out in</font>

order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to then you know make sure that</font>

1454
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,900
your complaint is understood

1455
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:28,630
understandable to us a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">aren't going to aren't going to do that</font>

1457
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:33,280

1458
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:35,019
notice so

1459
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,820
two things first<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all just so that</font>

1460
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:38,469
we're clear you get the going to notice

1461
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:40,960
that grandma's got paypal on her

1462
01:12:38,469 --> 01:12:43,239
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i was taking the issue first</font>

1463
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,650
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll shut down grandma as</font>

1464
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:46,209
opposed to check to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure grandma's</font>

1465
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:48,369
computer actually does have a picture of

1466
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:51,010
eight pounds website<font color="#CCCCCC"> on oh yeah I would</font>

1467
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:53,799
absolutely say you know check but don't

1468
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:56,230
verify don't don't get permission on

1469
01:12:53,800 --> 01:13:00,280
this in that then that's a lot different

1470
01:12:56,230 --> 01:13:02,019
than my understanding that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jared</font>

1471
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:04,119
like me to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a long time</font>

1472
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:06,940
ago BJ pointed out that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

1473
01:13:04,119 --> 01:13:08,500
customer support call from any customer

1474
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:11,440
wipes out the entire profit for that

1475
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:13,420
customer for an entire year so you're

1476
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably right that there's an issue</font>

1477
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:17,199
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> like going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through the process</font>

1478
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:19,780
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's the cost makes</font>

1479
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:21,129
the cost unbearable but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font>

1480
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:22,179
the day I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure how to solve a</font>

1481
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:27,860
problem

1482
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:32,000
good luck well so I was in the room when

1483
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:34,280
BJ Gil talked about if an AOL customer

1484
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:38,570
ever calls then you've lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

1485
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:42,170
profit you lost i don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that's</font>

1486
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:44,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">true sometimes those of us in up at the</font>

1487
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:50,840
microphone or guilty of some hyperbole

1488
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:54,980
but even if it's true<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't make</font>

1489
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:56,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">it right because that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a form of cost</font>

1490
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:58,700
shifting what you're saying is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

1491
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:01,460
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to grind out whatever thin</font>

1492
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:03,950
margin<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to get i need to be in</font>

1493
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:08,600
a toxic polluter I need to be in the

1494
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:11,000
toxic waste business model and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't</font>

1495
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:12,560
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> partly mostly because it just</font>

1496
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,910
means that your competitors have to do

1497
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:20,830
the same and as far as how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve that</font>

1498
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:23,120
I don't know that the solution is I

1499
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:25,340
don't know if it's some combination of

1500
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:29,599
subsidies and penalties and licenses or

1501
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:31,850
whatever but I sure don't like where the

1502
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,010
world will go if we don't treat this as

1503
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:37,220
a problem and search for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a solution for</font>

1504
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:39,410
it or I wouldn't be here take for<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1505
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:42,560
more question in the back did<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave</font>

1506
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:45,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Crocker Brandenburg</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internetworking your</font>

1507
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:48,860
you invoked two models really when was

1508
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:51,679
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> super bug and the other was war on</font>

1509
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:55,009
the war one the problem is we don't

1510
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:57,280
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an organized state attacking</font>

1511
01:14:55,010 --> 01:15:00,950
us we have something a lot more diffuse

1512
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:04,030
I tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prefer organized crime as the</font>

1513
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:07,550
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we're trying to respond to</font>

1514
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:11,300
but I'm I'm intrigued on the other side

1515
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:13,940
with a superbug model because you didn't

1516
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:16,220
actually create that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just natural</font>

1517
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:19,309
selection what you did was to make it

1518
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:22,600
way more efficient which is the problem

1519
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:26,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the the antibacterial hand creams</font>

1520
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:28,260
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing with that model that is</font>

1521
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,680
interesting to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1522
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:35,400
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts one is the response to an</font>

1523
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:37,920
attack and the other is prevention of

1524
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:39,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">the attack where many times prevention</font>

1525
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,790
is a better immune system immune systems

1526
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:43,440
about responding but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the immune</font>

1527
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:46,590
system is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> good enough shape you don't</font>

1528
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:51,150
even see the attack and so my question

1529
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:53,670
is you've really focused a lot on the

1530
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:54,570
aggressive response side of things and

1531
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:58,860
I'm curious whether you have any

1532
01:15:54,570 --> 01:16:02,070
comments about the the prevention or

1533
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:07,769
protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> and levels which end up not</font>

1534
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:09,740
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the attack of course a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

1535
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:13,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the attacks that we don't see our</font>

1536
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:15,630
probes and maybe the attacker moves

1537
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:20,070
elsewhere or maybe the attacker comes

1538
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:27,510
back later looking different so not

1539
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:29,940
seeing it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a panacea a lot of</font>

1540
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:31,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stuff that we use on the Internet</font>

1541
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:34,500
these protocols these tools these

1542
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:37,080
networks tax evolved in an academic

1543
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:40,410
environment where everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1544
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:42,090
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> was trusted so I have frequently</font>

1545
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:45,030
referred to them as laboratory grade

1546
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:47,000
protocols because they really do work

1547
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:49,800
well when it's a bunch of cooperating

1548
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,680
hackers around the table with a you know

1549
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:59,190
hub in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle don't necessarily</font>

1550
01:16:52,680 --> 01:17:01,950
scale the original work on firewalls

1551
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:04,559
caused a firestorm of protest from

1552
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:08,570

1553
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:11,610
end-to-end I want you to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to imagine</font>

1554
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:13,650
sort of how secure you think that

1555
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:16,598
computers would be if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't have</font>

1556
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:18,820
firewalls in other words

1557
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:22,149
the current present<font color="#E5E5E5"> day scenario is not</font>

1558
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:23,919
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> worst possible one people have said</font>

1559
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:28,479
the same thing about nap and said the

1560
01:17:23,919 --> 01:17:30,879
same thing about everything that solves

1561
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:33,219
some problem for somebody turned out to

1562
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:36,459
be a violation of somebody's idea of

1563
01:17:33,219 --> 01:17:38,349
what the original model was fortunately

1564
01:17:36,459 --> 01:17:39,909
we're in the commercial phase of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

1565
01:17:38,349 --> 01:17:41,709
this so people are pretty realistic

1566
01:17:39,909 --> 01:17:45,070
about doing whatever they have to do in

1567
01:17:41,709 --> 01:17:47,260
order to grow revenue and build

1568
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:50,049
businesses and so forth and so a lot of

1569
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:51,550
the purists are starting to kind of go

1570
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:52,840
away and shake their heads and disgust

1571
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:55,629
and say well and we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1572
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:59,859
end to end in the format I had had

1573
01:17:55,629 --> 01:18:02,289
envisioned I was such a purist for a

1574
01:17:59,859 --> 01:18:05,949
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't mean to throw</font>

1575
01:18:02,289 --> 01:18:10,869
stones<font color="#E5E5E5"> at others we obviously have to</font>

1576
01:18:05,949 --> 01:18:13,209
have better tools we just cannot keep

1577
01:18:10,869 --> 01:18:17,648
pushing this consumer-grade stuff out

1578
01:18:13,209 --> 01:18:21,070
and hoping for the best my problem with

1579
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:23,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is that better tools often come</font>

1580
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:25,329
along with other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are good</font>

1581
01:18:23,709 --> 01:18:28,059
for the companies providing those tools

1582
01:18:25,329 --> 01:18:31,688
you know I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft and Apple</font>

1583
01:18:28,059 --> 01:18:33,999
would be happy to produce laptops<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1584
01:18:31,689 --> 01:18:36,039
were utterly secure because every binary

1585
01:18:33,999 --> 01:18:38,108
would have to be signed by them so that

1586
01:18:36,039 --> 01:18:42,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could no longer get your software</font>

1590
01:18:51,749 --> 01:18:58,659
the purists don't really hold very much

1591
01:18:55,629 --> 01:19:04,090
sway and that we have got to have better

1592
01:18:58,659 --> 01:19:07,709
tools I don't have a pithy answer to to
