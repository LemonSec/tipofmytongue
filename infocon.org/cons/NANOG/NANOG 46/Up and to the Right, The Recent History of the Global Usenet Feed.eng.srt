00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:12,360
soldiers it good morning so I just

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,700
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quick review of the</font>

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,800
recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of the global usenet feed</font>

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I thought some of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Greybeards in the</font>

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,600
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> might find this kind of</font>

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,038
interesting that what started as the

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,140
original social networking and

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,960
user-generated content distribution

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:34,219
system what is it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago now</font>

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">is still going so my first chart is the</font>

11
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:40,559
monthly average of the global usenet

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,690
feed-in megabits per second obviously

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,260
the daily peaks are higher in the

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,480
monthly average so we're up peaked at

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,050
about 550 Meg's a second as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> average</font>

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:57,239
feed rate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> December it was december</font>

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:01,019
january just over the winter fitting an

18
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,820
easy curve to that it's a 26-percent

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,900
annualized growth for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last four and</font>

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,900
a half years which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty steady</font>

21
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,589
there's kind of a big dip in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> graph</font>

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,179
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look back and realized oh yeah</font>

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,140
that's when a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of eyes peas turned</font>

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,070
off their<font color="#E5E5E5"> usenet service last summer the</font>

25
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,340
dip didn't last real long I think maybe

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:32,548
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pent up volume came flushing</font>

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:36,380
through not Tom not long after I wanted

28
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to compare the fee volume to something</font>

29
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:46,259
yeah well anyway you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way using that works is you take a</font>

31
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,890
feed and you right at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk and then</font>

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,929
when your<font color="#E5E5E5"> disks fills up you start</font>

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,110
deleting what you had so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can keep</font>

34
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,509
taking the new stuff in and to get an

35
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,780
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the total storage you would need</font>

36
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hold one year of usenet one trailing</font>

37
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,310
year of using at any given time here's

38
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,110
it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the multi</font>

39
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,729
petabyte range for a single copy of

40
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,290
these are using if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to keep a</font>

41
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,480
year of it going

42
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,489
but what's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting is with</font>

43
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that computers and storage have</font>

44
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:22,689
gone as we're kind of entering a region

45
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,120
in time where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made it may be</font>

46
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:27,790
within reach to never expire articles

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,250
again it would take a fair amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

48
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,929
storage of course you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to multiply</font>

49
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:39,909
this for your levels of redundancy but

50
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:44,730
we're onward and upward and that's my

51
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:44,730
lightning talk thank
