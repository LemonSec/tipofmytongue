1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
okay actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going to kind of</font>

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,990
start out with a joke so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,510
camera right here I don't know if any of

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> been watching the remote feeds but I</font>

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,678
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the privilege to actually watch Paul</font>

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,870
as he was giving his keynote on Monday I

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,910
know so that camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> was activated and</font>

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,380
it's just kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interesting seeing the</font>

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">backside of the speaker instead of the</font>

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">frontside speaker as he's giving its</font>

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,750
address now I was trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of a</font>

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,910
joke debt would go along with it and

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,250
frankly anything that came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,510
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tasteless so if you have</font>

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,469
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you would like to bring</font>

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's great I love to hear but I</font>

17
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,920
liked that worked out really well didn't

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,410
it so what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about today is</font>

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what Aaron is doing and it's an</font>

20
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,929
interesting place<font color="#E5E5E5"> these days so with the</font>

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,300
v4 run out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the various strategies</font>

22
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,519
and dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with in policies dealing</font>

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,660
with v4 run out how to get encouraged

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,500
people to do with v6 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> its it as well</font>

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,589
as dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers going from a 2</font>

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,299
by 2 4 byte<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask numbers is a interesting</font>

27
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,479
time and all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are actually</font>

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,180
occurring all at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,030
it's it's an interesting place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be and</font>

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,610
also these things actually affect you

31
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,250
guys and I know that there's some of you

32
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,080
that actually cross pollinate from that

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,270
net augment<font color="#E5E5E5"> news to the air in meetings</font>

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,259
but not a lot of you and but most of

35
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,840
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things actually as as users of</font>

36
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,460
this space these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things do affect you</font>

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,270
and I encourage you to be a part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,240
process so what I first like to talk

39
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,979
about is our outreach efforts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin</font>

40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,369
actually participates in various venues

41
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,759
many venues that we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a part</font>

42
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,890
of and it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear about the</font>

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,020
lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge that people have it</font>

44
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,350
goes from what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we mean we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

45
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,960
infinite supply of ipv4 addresses I can

46
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,469
keep on going forever I don't need v6

47
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,570
that cost me extra money and in sort of

48
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,949
encouraging people that hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

49
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,289
really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start looking at this</font>

50
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,440
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an important thing to do same</font>

51
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,640
thing goes with<font color="#CCCCCC"> four by two asses</font>

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,950
actually we're trying to eat<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own dog</font>

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,670
food at Erin

54
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,799
and we have v6 enabled internally on all

55
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,049
our boxes and when i connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to various</font>

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,060
boxes to do my work is all over v six

57
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:28,220
and it just works and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> also have</font>

58
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,950
is we have a West Coast facility that

59
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,010
we're pairing with and we're picking

60
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,140
willing to appear with anyone best has a

61
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:41,750
that's willing to receive a for value s

62
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:44,000
and then ours is a 93<font color="#CCCCCC"> 220 so if you want</font>

63
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to appear with us on west coast please</font>

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,540

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,090
there and willing to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you we have</font>

66
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,640
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple people are doing this now and</font>

67
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,310
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forward and again</font>

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,679
we're trying to eat<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own dog food and</font>

69
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of goes beyond just regular</font>

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,579
users this<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes along with governments</font>

71
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,140
as well governments are starting to get

72
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,760
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because they hear</font>

73
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,529
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of shortage and</font>

74
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,060
they feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's this sort of</font>

75
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,760
compelling need to regulate the space

76
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,560
and how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way of doing that</font>

77
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,599
and we've been spending a significant

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,660
amount of time actually educating

79
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:20,000
various government entities on what is

80
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,920
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> aarons role in this and how</font>

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,920
governments can actually play along

82
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,600
another thing that we've done to kind of

83
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,010
help bring this whole idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of before run</font>

84
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,049
out to up front and<font color="#E5E5E5"> center to various</font>

85
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,790
organizations it's what we sent out an

86
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:41,060
announcement to over 15,000

87
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,548
organizations that before run out is

88
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,630
indeed incurring and that you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

89
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:50,600
planning for v6 and as an added benefit

90
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,730
now you have to when you get space from

91
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,019
air and you need to get on officers your

92
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,100
company to actually sign off on it

93
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,100
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the space</font>

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,429
who is cleanup project everybody knows

95
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,099
that who is is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven for spammers to</font>

96
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,769
get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> email addresses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and use it for</font>

97
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:13,018
various nefarious purposes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> kasich</font>

98
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,930
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> lipa Liz love their their</font>

99
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,789
information atrophied and there's been

100
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,590
various policy proposals I've been

101
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,149
pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> the floor to say hey we really</font>

102
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,729
need to fix this up because this is

103
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,198
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> none useful so we need to go</font>

104
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead and fix this and so the first</font>

105
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,419
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've done out is that we are</font>

106
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending out emails about two thousand a</font>

107
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,109
week to various people say hey look you

108
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,750
need update your records please<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to</font>

109
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,850
Erin and make that happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

110
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,949
currently estimating us to be four

111
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,720
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually complete as part of</font>

112
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,010
the policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're actually following</font>

113
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,260
through on this it also involves

114
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,729
reassignments so that phase one is

115
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually direct assignments where we</font>

116
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:51,870
have actually existing relationship with

117
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:55,320
our customers the second part

118
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,729
reassignments is actually you on your

119
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationship with your customers and</font>

120
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,210
actually registering that information

121
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,500
with us and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

122
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,539
actually going out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and actually</font>

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,910
contacting them as well and this is

124
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:09,150
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you should be aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

125
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:13,050
and say hey look I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to start</font>

126
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,210
cleaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff up revoked address</font>

127
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,590
space earrings pendants may forget

128
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,510
amount of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the last number of</font>

129
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,549
years actually say okay look you guys

130
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,520
aren't paying your fees we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

131
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,650
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and revoke your space and</font>

132
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,049
reissue<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to someone else and you can</font>

133
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,580
see here that we've been quite active in

134
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,699
making that happen you can see that

135
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,139
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of space that we received here</font>

136
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,360
and we've been very careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> making this</font>

137
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,370
happen in terms of okay we're making

138
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this information is the space</font>

139
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,820
isn't routed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we work with</font>

140
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,220
those people and say hey look you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

141
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,620
need to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> off let's get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together make</font>

142
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a nominal amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so come on guys</font>

143
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,979
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get going on this and if</font>

144
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,440
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> fails where the space is</font>

147
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,320
holding pattern for a year and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

148
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,320
reissued

149
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,050
recovered a asses same thing goes with

150
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,410
recovered a SS you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that here's</font>

151
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:14,350
the number of a SS have been returned

152
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:16,300
including in this is both to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bite and</font>

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,010
earlier stages received before by task

155
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,750
and the code wasn't quite ready at that

156
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,700
point and people<font color="#CCCCCC"> said look I really need</font>

157
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use something operationally here give</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">me a 2-byte ass and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll come back some</font>

159
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:34,300
other day 44 by and one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

160
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,909
that's now that code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

161
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,340
available in working that should no

162
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,530
longer be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully you guys</font>

163
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,810
can actually start looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font>

164
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,809
again encourage you to use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by das</font>

165
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to talk to stuff about stuff</font>

166
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,380
that's actually an earring gear in my

167
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,969
heart and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very sort of</font>

168
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,150
engineering activities that we have

169
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,100
going on within Aaron we have

170
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,320
essentially five different aspects that

171
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,270
we're actually looking at here one is

172
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,030
upgrading our existing services that

173
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,430
we're calling Aaron<font color="#E5E5E5"> online and this is</font>

174
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:13,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a movement to move things onto</font>

175
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:16,030
the web off of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> template based system</font>

176
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,479
using email and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that</font>

177
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">this gives us it's a much better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

178
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,630
authentication model in dealing with you

179
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,239
guys because right now this whole idea

180
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">of using email leaves a lot to be</font>

181
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,190
desired from authentication perspective

182
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,039
we're also looking at improving the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRR</font>

183
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,410
system and right now I know it doesn't

184
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,260
understand anything about v6 and this

185
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,060
isn't so good and we have a couple

186
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">people actually in house right now there</font>

187
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,320
are focusing on upgrading the system in

188
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,609
integrating it with our<font color="#CCCCCC"> existing</font>

189
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,150
database and hopefully we'll have

190
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,600
something up by the end of q3 this year

191
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:56,830
so we will be able at that point support

192
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:00,040
v6 objects within our<font color="#E5E5E5"> IR our next thing</font>

193
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,169
is improving who is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> AR who is we have</font>

194
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,290
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple different facilities right now</font>

195
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:08,770
we're distributing our whois clusters

196
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,360
East Coast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and West Coast and have a lot</font>

197
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,979
more boxes and using a lot more

198
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,870
redundancy things that we've learned

199
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:15,919
from verisign where I used to work

200
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,210
and actually putting all those things

201
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,240
together so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

205
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,890
billing you can say we're actually

206
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,840
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a replacement that who is and</font>

207
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,309
there's various proposals on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the floor</font>

208
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,580
there's this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort that's been put</font>

209
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:40,369
out by the ITF called crisp and there's

210
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,410
a service at verisign a number of others

211
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,300
put out is called iris which is a

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:57,290
looking at we're building internally and

217
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,630
hopefully will be piloting<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time</font>

glaring hole we have a pilot<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

out and having you guys actually test

drive it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the final part is DNS SEC</font>

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,569
is actually thanks to it right we're

283
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,960
actually taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> our code and porting it</font>

284
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:32,720
within our system and it's a first part

285
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a hopefully multi-stage process and</font>

286
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,340
putting this information together and it

287
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,840
will allow you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually start playing</font>

288
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,060
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things issuing things called</font>

289
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">Roiz and and seeing how it can actually</font>

290
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,319
validate within your systems and so and

291
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,380
so forth so all this information will be

292
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,930
coming very very soon and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

293
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,939
want to talk about its DNS SEC DNS SEC

294
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,250
is actually coming we're very close to

295
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,480
we're doing our testing right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

296
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,310
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be signing the zones that</font>

297
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">were authoritah for all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slash eights</font>

298
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,800
you can see a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples 24 dot in</font>

299
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,800
a tarp all the way to 216 dad or DARPA

300
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're doing this in two phases phase</font>

301
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,490
one is actually signing the zones and

302
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,980
we'll be rolling this out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> July first</font>

303
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,170
and the second phase is actually

304
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,210
inclusion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DS records where you in</font>

305
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,579
turn can let<font color="#CCCCCC"> us know that your zones are</font>

306
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,990
signed and that is dependent on the

307
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">provisioning system that we're putting</font>

308
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">within air and online and we estimate</font>

309
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,969
that to be done ready I first quarter of

310
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,790
2010 and you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the specifics I at</font>

311
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> website or at the URL at the bottom</font>

313
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,910
the foil and you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow</font>

314
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,290
that and you can get the trust anchors

315
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,860
and everything else that you need it

316
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,870
very much

317
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,670
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally the right model which</font>

318
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,920
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing this for about three</font>

319
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,920
years now so other stuff is fairly well

320
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,430
well formed in mature and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to</font>

321
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,199
go one of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I like to</font>

322
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the policies as I</font>

323
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,300
mentioned before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron is in interesting</font>

324
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:02,899
times right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now with the before run out</font>

325
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,339
and v6 adoption and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a lot</font>

326
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,230
of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going across</font>

327
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:08,089
whether it go from directory services

328
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,100
hey we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have better data accuracy</font>

329
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:14,510
and that kind of butter but forward this

330
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:16,430
a POC clean up that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> put out the</font>

331
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,920
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is v6 for community networks</font>

332
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:22,790
should they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a special exemption for</font>

333
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,610
space global I a no to our IRB for

334
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,849
policy how does I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna actually allocate</font>

335
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:31,430
space recover space that that's been

336
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,079
given<font color="#E5E5E5"> back by the community given to I</font>

337
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,060
Anna and how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it come back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

338
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:38,149
rirs making sure all those things that

339
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">were somewhat informal when for making</font>

340
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:43,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">them more formalized now transfers that</font>

341
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,579
actually is embodied and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron's policy</font>

342
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,050
2009 dot one right now which was

343
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a little bit controversial</font>

344
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,189
because it had there's a policy has put

345
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,350
in place last year the board actually

346
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,660
put had these emergency provisions that

347
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,600
they invoked there was a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

348
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,189
churn dealing with this and in the note

349
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,660
was actually it was good to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

350
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">community came together and said okay</font>

351
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,469
this isn't quite rate this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

352
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,649
want we'll put it together what you guys

353
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:13,089
have made is pretty close<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they made</font>

354
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:16,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the modifications and now it's a policy</font>

355
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:17,480
dealing with visa at dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

356
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,360
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> discrete networks this is</font>

357
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,860
actually a hole in the policy framework

358
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,100
right now and needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fix this</font>

359
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:27,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">therefore before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but not for v6</font>

360
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:30,500
extending the life of 16-bit are two x

361
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,630
KS assignments Paul<font color="#CCCCCC"> VIX did you came up</font>

362
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:37,040
with a term of bike how many bits in a

363
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:39,829
byte and the final part is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

364
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,060
a lot of a lot of talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what to do</font>

365
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:45,769
with v4 run out and should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start</font>

366
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,170
actually giving out less space as we get

367
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:50,480
close to the end and it's just a good

368
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea and that does again sort of a</font>

369
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,240
controversial sort of thing extensive

370
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,510
the life

371
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,670
before by how much I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

372
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,950
whole idea here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey look we got to</font>

373
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,209
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling moving to be six people</font>

374
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,420
might need a little bit of before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

375
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:08,660
bootstrap again but that is just a

376
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:12,050
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit controversial next thing is</font>

377
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,730
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with participation we really do</font>

378
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,819
like to see your voice being heard with

379
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,350
an errand in the fall the meeting in

380
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">dearborn we're going to have a joint</font>

381
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,029
meeting and given that the waiting

382
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,310
matters are going on I know most you

383
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:28,070
guys don't follow policy or care too

384
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,020
much but it does affect you and and

385
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,880
there's also things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you said golly</font>

386
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,980
you know Aaron's evil place they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

387
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,689
all these evil policies that you know I

388
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,209
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow their dark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oni and all</font>

389
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:41,360
this other kinds of hoo-ha well this

390
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:43,250
isn't really weird once I actually are

391
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,480
implementing these policy but you are

392
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that are actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> putting these</font>

393
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,740
policies together and if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

394
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,130
them come to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> floor and help help</font>

395
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:56,209
make these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and we would</font>

396
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:57,980
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage that and to actually</font>

397
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:59,630
follow through on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that set if you're</font>

398
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,980
Aaron member is free for you guys to

fellowship program or we have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>
