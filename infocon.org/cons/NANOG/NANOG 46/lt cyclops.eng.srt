4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,190
this was this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just an update</font>

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:18,869
basically on a tool that was presented

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:23,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">last year Nana and it pretty much</font>

7
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,980
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> change except the name and</font>

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,490
logo logo is still the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what what</font>

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,219
is new in Cyclops well basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,370
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have user profiles in the tool so</font>

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,719
basically users are able to input

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> configurations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> such as</font>

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,059

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,770
trigger alerts based on this information

16
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:50,940
except is able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect events such as</font>

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,530
changes and so on we also provide global

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:09,210
we also have a picture now that allows

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,280
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to monitor routes to DNS servers</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a new feature called anomaly listings</font>

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,439
basically it gives you a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,740
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the types of alerts the tool</font>

53
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,989
includes right now we have alerts that

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,630
work on graphics level and we have alert

55
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,520
set to work on yes level on prefix level

56
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,310
there's mainly three types of alerts

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,880
origin change and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this can be triggered</font>

58
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,050
because either a prefix I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jack or</font>

59
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,790
someone else decided to announce your

60
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:47,100
prefix caused by a Miss configuration

61
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:51,120
there's also alerts caused by next hop

62
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,710
changes if your graphics go to always

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,670
through a certain provider and<font color="#CCCCCC"> San Luis</font>

64
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:58,650
switch to a second provider and then

65
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,950
there's the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific alert someone</font>

66
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,370
when a more specific version of one of

67
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,730
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> practice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is being announced by by</font>

68
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:11,370
someone else on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> S alerts side we</font>

69
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,350
have three types of alerts new prefix

70
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,500
alerts it means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your es</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

71
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,329
asking your prefix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not on your</font>

72
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,240
graphics list the new neighbor alert

73
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,970
basically it's an alert trigger whenever

74
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,370
you appear connected to another yes that

75
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,470
is not on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbor list and this</font>

76
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,160
this type of alerts can be triggered

77
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,980
because someone is doing a false link

78
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,799
attack for instance the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type of</font>

79
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,869
alert is transit and this is common in

80
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,780
in routing leaks so transit a as if you

81
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,730
are still yes there there's going to be

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,780
on alert if you're a s is going to

83
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,489
appear in the middle of some past

84
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,700
providing some transit that is not

85
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:55,350
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

92
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,470
need to do is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to create an</font>

95
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'll receive a confirmation email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,060
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to click there to confirm the</font>

97
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,219
registration

98
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,950
after you're done<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you can start</font>

99
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,230
configuring your configure your

100
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:32,219
information first thing to do is to have

101
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:37,080
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own prefixes and for that you can</font>

102
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,389
just input your guess name here or your

103
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,580
s number and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cyclops you automatically</font>

104
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,310
detect all the prefixes and asked by

105
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,070
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can later add this</font>

106
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the system so you can see here UCLA</font>

107
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,300
have all these prefixes here you can

108
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">uncheck the boxes that corresponds to</font>

109
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,190
false positives graphics that you don't

110
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,840
want to monitor the next thing to do is

111
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,490
to configure what type of alerts you

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,119
want to see on each of these prefixes

113
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,700
and you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> using these boxes</font>

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,490
here so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see there's the origin</font>

115
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,180
change alert next stop alert and Martha

116
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,680
city colors so it will give you

117
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,510
flexibility to configure all these

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,810
alerts and also we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> include here on</font>

119
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,550
this column the number the<font color="#E5E5E5"> s numbers</font>

120
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,610
that are allowed to originate each of

121
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:26,870
these prefixes on second column you have

122
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,039
the allow next hops so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

123
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,630
actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have any case here but</font>

124
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,890
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have multiple s numbers here</font>

125
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,840
it's basically a logical bar on this

126
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:41,190
next thing you're going to do is to have

127
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:45,960
your s numbers in this case we've seen

128
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:48,450
here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 52 UCLA and you can basically</font>

129
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,219
type here your your organization name

130
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,380
Cyclops the automatic will find urs

131
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,910
numbers and then you configure basically

132
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,650
type of before that this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font>

133
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,580
neighbors actually so there's a third

134
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,620
step here which for each<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASU basically</font>

135
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,810
tell Cyclops which are your neighbors

136
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,789
and again the tool can detect is

137
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,710
automatically if you type just the s

138
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:14,099
number the tool can automatically detect

139
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:18,299
all the neighbors<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then finally you</font>

140
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:21,090
you configure the tool so that you began

141
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,470
basically tell Cyclops which alerts you

142
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,289
want what type of alerts you want to

143
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,120
receive and here I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about TS</font>

144
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">levelers there's three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different types</font>

145
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,860
of alerts as i mentioned new prefix in

146
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,219
your neighbor and trans

147
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,810
