Washington how the carriers are involved

to please get involved in and help us

00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:59,280

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,630
put together risk assessments different

35
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,270
types of plans and so we have a group

for IT information technology which

101
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,230
moment about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the IT sector has been</font>

102
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,340
doing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this world and I'll pick it</font>

103
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:38,130
back up again in a moment with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

104
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:39,720
concept yeah hi so when when I first got

105
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,220
sucked into this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't realize</font>

106
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,900
exactly what I was going into I went

107
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:48,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a ballroom in in this hotel about</font>

108
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,720
two blocks from the White House that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

109
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,630
filled about like this with different

110
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,180
people and when it ended up there was a

111
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,099
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> small set of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about as many</font>

112
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,799
as would sit maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one or two rows of</font>

113
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:04,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">tables here and in some cases it's just</font>

114
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,829
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> small set of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people and and</font>

115
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,228
what's happened is over the time we've

116
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,250
we've had the these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

117
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:13,440
private<font color="#CCCCCC"> sector</font>

118
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,690
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people from the government and</font>

119
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,579
when they asked us all to come together

120
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">and organize it started with a room like</font>

121
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,620
this and end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small set of</font>

122
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and the government was used to</font>

123
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,530
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the private sector not showing</font>

124
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,380
up to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types of meetings</font>

125
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,960
and the IT sector really took and said

126
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,460
look we really need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this right and</font>

127
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the IT sector really stepped up i</font>

128
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,280
believe and said it's it's time that we

129
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,200
go and we do this and so the IT sector

130
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,940
is very proud<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the fact that they said</font>

131
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,340
look for the first ones we sat down

132
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,620
jointly with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government we wrote we</font>

133
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,419
wrote this sector specific plan which

134
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,000
talks about it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a variety of</font>

135
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,919
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we spent a lot of time</font>

136
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,320
I can't tell you how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times I've</font>

137
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,940
gone into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a meeting and said no really</font>

138
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,740
these computer things they're actually

139
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,830
function based this isn't something

140

you know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go and say okay</font>

146
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,710
where's the 13 root name servers and

147
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,200
let's go and put a guy in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

148
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,299
with a gun<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have now secured</font>

149
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,830
the root<font color="#E5E5E5"> nameservers that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

150
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,900
you go and approach things and this has

151
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,260
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a continual challenge that we face</font>

152
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,419
and and I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really something</font>

153
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,710
where we've harped on this for<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and</font>

154
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">years and years and a lot of great</font>

155
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,620
people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this in an advocate for</font>

156
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,390
that we've gone and said look we've

157
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,160
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set specific goals we've tried</font>

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say there's a lot of best practices</font>

out there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this industry I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

162
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,500
wish that everyone across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the industry</font>

163
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,419
you could do and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our things we've</font>

164
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,970
tried to do is educate everyone on what

165
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,289
those best practices are and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

166
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,600
communicate to the government that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

167
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,090
we actually know what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

170
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,910
personally have in watching what's going

171
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,690
on because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seems that there is a</font>

172
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,700
growing impatience in the DC area with

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,400
the rest of the country who apparently

174

doesn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess they hit the</font>

here who are in this room show up with

me to go and help spend some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

179
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,659
explaining these people what what the

industry is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and that we</font>

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have smart people behind these</font>

playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> tag team obviously let me talk a</font>

185
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,650
little more in depth about the

186
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,930
communications sector and how we work

187
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,940
many of us are quite familiar with it we

188
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,380
use this chart<font color="#CCCCCC"> here we built this for</font>

189
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,669
government so that the folks in

190
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,740
government would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a better</font>

191
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:51,389
understanding as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see in the</font>

192
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,000
middle is the the core network we use

193
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,889
the typical cloud symbol nice little<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,270
know drawings of routers and switches

195
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,680
because everybody understands that we

196
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,650
don't try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> map out what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> networks</font>

197
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,850
look like but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the typical ways that</font>

198
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,409
we want our government partners to

199
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,880
understand is when we talk about the

200
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,530
communications sector what most people

201
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,900
think of is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we call the access</font>

202
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,190
that's those things along the bottom

203
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,070
like wireless access<font color="#CCCCCC"> through cell phones</font>

204
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet access broadband video am/fm</font>

205
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,909
radio in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the communication sector</font>

206
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,880
is more than just telephones and

207
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">internets we also pull in XM radio any</font>

208
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,509
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> broadcast am/fm TV stations that</font>

209
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,360
that whole world is considered to be

210
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:29,250
communications above that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we show the</font>

211
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,139
services the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> three voice video data</font>

212
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,840
and then try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> break that down into</font>

213
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,760
the different types there this very

214
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,739
simplistic chart we call it the pancake

215
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,870
chart is what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use in Washington when</font>

216
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,580
we're talking to the government

217
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,229
officials about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> communication</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sector</font>

218
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,310
so we can point<font color="#E5E5E5"> at different parts and</font>

219
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,310
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what we're talking about right</font>

220
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,560
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this thing in this diagram so</font>

221
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,030
that type of visual helps you're free to

222
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,010
use this if you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> for any of your</font>

223
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,239
own presentations it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

224
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,039
we've adopted<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the last few years</font>

225
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and seems to work when we're talking</font>

226
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,000
about technical as well as non technical

227
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,840
and policy people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and others just have</font>

us all on the same same sheet of music

just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> background as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to how we</font>

the way back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our roots with Telegraph</font>

236
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:18,300
pre Civil War there's been a strong

relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the private</font>

241
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,599
companies wanted to let<font color="#E5E5E5"> them compete</font>

242
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,639
individually but they realized very

243
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,500
quickly that for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Civil</font>

the Confederacy could not move could not

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,409
using private telegraph lines so they're

248
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,630
already had been sort of that

249
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,819

the cuban<font color="#CCCCCC"> missile crisis President</font>

264

Kennedy realized that that thing could

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,979
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been averted but for the fact</font>

266
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,720
that the United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> communication</font>

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,680
talk to Russia and work out the

inside the United States the reliability

wasn't always there for the president to

reach out to the various cabinet members

274
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,640

00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,770
sitting there and everyone convulsing

431
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,840
through you know all the little

432
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,189
technical and nitpicky policy things

433
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,920
that that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they were</font>

434
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,680
worried about we we got together we went

435
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a room that was like I said I think</font>

436
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,099
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this big or maybe even a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

437
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,050
bit bigger when we had the launch to

438
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:19,430
just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a you know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very small</font>

439
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:21,229
meeting room in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hotel where we decided</font>

440
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that yes we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to finally organize</font>

441
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,980
ourselves and we're going to get with

442
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the program because if we don't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

443
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,210
the government is going to invent

444
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,800
something for us and we decided that we

445
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,190
would rather play bald and have

446
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">something be invented to be otherwise</font>

447
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:41,960
because that that really scares a lot of

448
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,370
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people in the industry so you</font>

449
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,160
know we brought together all these

450
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,860
people we've defined a mission<font color="#CCCCCC"> statement</font>

451
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,870
in the the IT sec it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

452
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,360
really important for us the big

453
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,800
questions for you guys here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

454
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,300
that you have for us is you know why are

455
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,520
you telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this IT thing we're</font>

456
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,990
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're all service providers or</font>

457
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,850
these you know or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else there's</font>

458
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,950
this nice long list of people who are

459
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,540
eligible to join the IT sec and if you

460
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,100
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're eligible to join or</font>

461
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,079
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we left you out you</font>

462
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,760
should tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it will provide</font>

463
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you an effective opportunity to</font>

464
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,270
participate with us without without

465
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,800
going and feeling like you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

466
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,560
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lobby the government that's it</font>

467
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,890
explicitly something that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not set</font>

468
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,359
up to do we're set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up as a special</font>

469
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,910
not-for-profit corporation actually that

470
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,920
that cannot lobby the government there's

471
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:39,920
a section of the 501 C the 501 text

472
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,750
language that says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you</font>

473
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,160
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mabi the government so we've got</font>

474
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,630
internet service providers which

475
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,310
includes backbone providers we've got

476
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,470
email providers so people

477
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:52,859
you know I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a google</font>

478
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,570
recently applied to be a member so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

479
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,310
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google does not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only email but</font>

480
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,630
search and all sorts of other stuff the

481
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS operators</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD operators one of the</font>

482
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">things i see here that's missing from</font>

483
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,780
the list on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides is storage</font>

484
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,300
providers people who go in manufacturing

485
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,030
equipment but primarily here I think any

486
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,220
of you who are operating DNS or networks

487
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,560
which is hopefully most everyone in

488
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,510
these are in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room you know you</font>

489
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,448
should have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of representation</font>

490
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,709
here because when the government goes

491
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:25,079
out and tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

492
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,240
risk analysis they need good subject

493
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,280
matter experts to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bounce</font>

494
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,650
questions off and bounce these theories

495
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,780
off of what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happens that's</font>

496
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's happened for for a</font>

497
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:40,910
while the IT sec it's important to

498
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,320
maintain because like Marcus mentioned

499
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,630
it's set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> under the sea pack which</font>

500
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,810
means i believe amongst other things

501
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,700
were protected from<font color="#CCCCCC"> foia so we can't we</font>

502
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,669
can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to worry about</font>

503
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:58,679
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government or some reporter going</font>

504
00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:01,200
and giving away your information we the

505
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,410
slide deck i have has<font color="#CCCCCC"> x.x four percent</font>

506
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,929
for our representation of the sector but

507
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,220
it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly something where we</font>

508
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,230
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that be one hundred</font>

509
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,440
percent as opposed to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller</font>

510
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:16,920
percentage here we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we try and</font>

511
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">provide you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a consolidated</font>

512
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,500
organization so that when the government

513
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,910
reaches out it has you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as as one of</font>

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know says a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> belly button</font>

515
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,910
something they can reach out and they

516
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,580
can physically touch and say you are the

517
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:34,140
people who represent the industry as a

518

whole the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FCC has a bunch of strategic</font>

objectives of you know establishing this

520
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,960
framework work in partnership with the

521
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,449
government it it works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

522
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,250
organization called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sac which is</font>

523
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,870
set up for doing information sharing and

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,330
analysis just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the communication</font>

sector has their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sack for doing</font>

526
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,770
that we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to bring together</font>

527
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,428
you know really the best people that we

528
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:58,530
have out there and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

establish<font color="#E5E5E5"> and establishing rd priorities</font>

530
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,629
and other things there's also things

531
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:06,389
like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these protective programs</font>

532
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,460
which you know people naturally think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

533
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,169
as setting up buffer zones around the

534
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,150
building how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prevent you know</font>

535
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:13,860
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> from putting a truck full of</font>

536
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,230
explosives in front of a colocation

537
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,120
facility and that such as stuff there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

538
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,370
some amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical aspect of it of</font>

539
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,928
this but it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> very limited in</font>

540
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,030
in this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if someone takes</font>

541
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:25,440
out one facility the internet will

542
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,629
generally self heal and route around

543
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,150
that there may be some limited loss but

544
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,309
not a lot and we really try and

545
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,789
collaborate with all the other people

546
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:39,270
who are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know are the smees in their</font>

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:44,429
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> comm sector it's something where</font>

549
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,980
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it as an inevitable that the IT</font>

550
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:50,370
and the communication sector are going

551
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,840
to be merged very soon as I mentioned

552
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,750
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we try to do this function based</font>

553
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,668
risk assessment which you know is

554
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,630
absolutely important and we try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

555
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:04,260
and apply the these methodologies

556
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:06,990
consistently to try and come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know real things that we can actually</font>

take out of these which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if</font>

00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,990
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect a root server how do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we go about that you know a lot of</font>

people tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

562
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,990
focusing on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like protecting the</font>

other name servers out there in the

world that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are far more</font>

566
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,090
interesting and should be protected and

567
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:32,250
much more rigorously than they are now

568
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,230
the IT<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things have</font>

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:40,650
12 which the government had set out as

00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:44,510
part of the comprehensive national

572
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:47,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> initiative and that was on</font>

573
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,919
just one of the projects on how does how

574
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,200
can the government look at information

575
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,390
sharing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard</font>

576
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,919
to solve and anyone who's tried to

577
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,500
figure out how to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

578
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,450
between what more than one organization

579
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,250
where you've established an NDA it's

580
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,890
something that's incredibly complex to

581
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,140
solve but it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

582
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,600
you know the government continues to

583
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,510
strive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work together and the the</font>

584
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,560
private sector people continue to to try

585
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and figure out how we can solve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

586
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,889
problem there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITI sac which is the</font>

587
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:22,370
operational arm that's not who i'm here

591
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:32,510
membership tears but and they go and

592
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:35,540
they try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and set up a you know get this</font>

594
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,240
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea of what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

595
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:43,460
concept for all the operations and have

596
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,380
a good idea of all that stuff they also

597
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,360
participate in exercises the government

598
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,070
goes out and tests things various

599
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,179
different times to see what what's your

600
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,679
response what what if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens and</font>

601
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,920
those exercises like cyber storm have

602
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,360
been very valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a number of</font>

603
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,460
organizations because they can test out

604
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,030
their internal staff and see what they

605
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:08,300
do in response to that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font>

606
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:09,710
continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work with the comm sec we've</font>

607
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:13,790
got you know this just mentions about

608
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:16,220
how marcus serves on the IT on the IT

613
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:27,260
think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of space here where</font>

614
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,850
you know as Paul was alluding to this

615
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,350
morning you know we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

616
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,540
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and brightest minds</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in how do we solve this network</font>

618
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,070

619
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got all these guys out there who</font>

620
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,879
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do really bad and nasty</font>

figure out some way to turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> those tables</font>

623
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,470
you know on the bad guys and I really

624
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:52,420
think that we need some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

625
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:55,010
huge leap forward to make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

626
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,900
you know there's cyber storm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

627
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,900
like i<font color="#CCCCCC"> said the exercise where the</font>

628
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,640
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> can test you know not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

629
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,590
their response but the industry has not

630
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,530
pertain to come in and test their own

631
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,600
responses to join the ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> see see there</font>

632
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some minor membership requirements</font>

633
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,949
it doesn't require<font color="#E5E5E5"> any money but you</font>

634
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to be able to commit to participate</font>

635
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,260
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarterly session</font>

636
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,940
twice a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do that via the</font>

637
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,530
phone so you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one guy who</font>

638
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,030
puts it on speakerphone for about eight

639
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:27,910
hours oh I'm sorry there's quarterly

640
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:34,600
meetings but you have to attend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font>

641
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:35,950
yet to a year sorry yeah it's it's

642
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,490
hopefully more clear in the slides than

643
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,840
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> explained you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you need to</font>

644
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,010
participate in one working group which

645
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,409
means you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get some more</font>

646
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,750
email but that's that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard and</font>

647
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:49,390
I really think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

648
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,490
would would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be valuable in the the risk</font>

649
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,500
assessment group there's communications

650
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,010
and outreach working group they go out

651
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,890
and they try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and recruit new members</font>

652
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:01,270
like I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here hopefully there's a</font>

653
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:05,050
plan to reports working group they go

654
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:06,490
and they you know they deal with all the

655
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:10,360
plans the government has a plan for

656
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:11,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything you read the nip I'm sure</font>

657
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,800
you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea of the scope of these</font>

658
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,899
things it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more fun than</font>

659
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,460
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems I hope the risk assessment</font>

660
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:22,600
committee who goes in response to the

661
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,890
different analysis we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put</font>

662
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,090
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> an entire picture of what the</font>

663
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,740
risks are four different parts of the

664
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,330
sector there's the information committee

665
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,040
of how can we effectively share

666
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,500
information from one private sector to

667
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,060
another as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as with the government</font>

668
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,130
and there's all sorts of stuff here on

669
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,600
this there's the metrics<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee which</font>

670
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:41,110
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know anything about and</font>

671
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:45,699
the protective programs<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee which</font>

672
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:47,560
you know is it is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you know</font>

673
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,090
I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different things to protect</font>

674
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,879
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assets and infrastructure out</font>

675
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:54,310
there those r md guys which hopefully we

676
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:58,540
can get get some great innovations in

677
00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:00,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the space to go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know change this</font>

678
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:05,680
so it's a more of an equal footing as

679
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:07,090
far as defending our networks um there's

680
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,600
the executive committee which is

681
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,730
responsible for for the all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

682
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,639
primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> of liaison roles with the</font>

683
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,020
government they get together on

684
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,800
teleconference a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> times a month in</font>

685
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:25,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT side I i believe the</font>

686
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:27,100
the next calls tonight there's a variety

687
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,020
of different ways that they've tried to

688
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,929
giving it up such that you can have the

689
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,250
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations in there so your</font>

690
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,480
trade organizations if you're

691
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,210
represented through<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

692
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,840
already in part be a member of the IT

693
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:43,180
sec already but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we try and make it make</font>

694
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,709
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we we have not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only big people</font>

695
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,390
but small people participating in it so

696
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have some small companies I believe</font>

697
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,870
one of the smallest has maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> four or</font>

698
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:53,140
five employees that's participating I

699
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:55,959
tscc and that's something which i think

700
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,060
is incredibly valuable and we try we try

701
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can sort of</font>

702
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:04,810
hog<font color="#CCCCCC"> that space we you know it's well</font>

703
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,000
represented if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide you want to be</font>

704
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:10,300
a member you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> email these people you</font>

705
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,680
can also come and talk to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

706
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,800
go and get you the membership

707
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,600
applications for that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

708
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,659
approved but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really more of a smoke</font>

709
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:24,610
test of you know are you really involved

710
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:25,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the sector and that's it questions so</font>

711
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,889
while we're lining up for questions

712
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,149
because I know this would be thousands

713
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,130
out particularly with a break coming up

714
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,990
let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> also point out that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

715
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,580
sectors do the same thing we do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

716
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,790
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the finance sector we work</font>

717
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,350
with chemical we work with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy</font>

718
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,850
guys electricity in particular is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

719
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,919
smart grid is starting to come of age so

720
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,770
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just us there's a lot of this</font>

721
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,780
yes sir yeah so this is mostly probably

722
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:49,800
a question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jared and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your name and</font>

723
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:52,030
affiliation standards on either way so

724
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,980
here's that here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question and I'll</font>

725
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,740
bet<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people here are thinking</font>

726
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,120
this but they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say so</font>

727
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,280
you're a smart guy and you do networking

728
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,620
stuff and your network seems to work

729
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,030
more or less why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

730
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,979
these government people like what's the

731
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,389
point there's a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like much</font>

732
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,590
higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> level than all because you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

733
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,150
down in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nuts and bolts and there's</font>

734
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,080
some useful stuff in there but why

735
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,669
should people

736
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,860
this room take any of that process

737
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:18,850
seriously at all what<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible good</font>

738
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:21,100
things could<font color="#CCCCCC"> come out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think</font>

739
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:23,168
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> few parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is that there's</font>

740
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,529
plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of opportunity to actually</font>

741
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:28,330
interact with other smart people at

742
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:30,309
other organizations just in the same way

743
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,360
that you have that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that</font>

744
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:32,710
they're smart people who come from

745
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,510
different service providers and

746
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,070
different vendors come together so you

747
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,620
have opportunity not only do that

748
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,629
personal level networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also</font>

749
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:44,049
better meet everyone's business needs

750
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:46,539
and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason honestly is the</font>

751
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:49,870
internet space specifically has been

752
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:53,049
unregulated for a long time and I

753
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:56,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">suspect that that may not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

754
00:27:53,049 --> 00:28:00,879
that is sustainable if the industry

755
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:03,519
doesn't show up and being<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one tech</font>

756
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,380
guy in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these conversations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

757
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,149
come to when they ask and say well what

758
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,970
happens to the internet if this happens

759
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:12,939
and there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> or three or four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

760
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:16,000
smart people who may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to show up</font>

761
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:19,029
in at one of these meetings I can't

762
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,070
cover it all myself I need other smart

763
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:23,200
people to come with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and participate</font>

764
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:25,480
and I've in the past recruited people

765
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,889
like Patrick and Chris morrow to come to

766
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,539
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> meetings and I've seen them there</font>

767
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:31,658
and that's been something that's been

768
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:32,950
valuable not only to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> educate the</font>

769
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,419
government in this is what we're

770
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,100
actually doing but when they come in

771
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:38,380
some of these meetings they invite the

772
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,090
congressional staffers to attend and

773
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,320
they can understand oh wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

774
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,590
actually people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something</font>

775
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">in response to this as opposed to you</font>

776
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,010
know oh it's a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Industry people</font>

777
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:49,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they're all out in the bay area and</font>

778
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,879
they're running crazy and making all

779
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,189
this money and and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff they</font>

780
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,990
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something where you know</font>

781
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:59,700
you can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore this forever and</font>

782
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,700
somebody needs to pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it</font>

783
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:07,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jolie egli checkpoint</font>

784
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:10,629
I'm not entirely clear on what the

785
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:13,559
difference between frank discussion with

786
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:17,379
the feds and lobbying them actually is

787
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,700
so perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see a let me dig into</font>

788
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:20,498
that for a second a lot of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

789
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,139
think about lobbying it's mostly working

790
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:24,759
with a registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> lobbyist working with</font>

791
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:27,129
Congress either directly with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> member</font>

792
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,840
or with a members staff for example

00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:31,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">senator Rockefeller has put up this big</font>

to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that the language should</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that bill become law represents our</font>

798
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:40,749
interests what the sector coordinating

799
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,158
councils do though is not work with

800
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:43,690
Congress that's a different world we

801
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,659
don't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the regulators like the</font>

FCC or the SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> or others but working</font>

with homeland DoD<font color="#CCCCCC"> White House those that</font>

804
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:54,700
are really in the policy space not the

805
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:55,749
legislative with a regulatory world so

806
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,419
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they understand what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the private</font>

00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:06,279
companies can work competitively and our

their jobs swinging in the breeze while

819

they go off and address security issues

820
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,200
it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an appropriate role of</font>

821
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,990
government would be to fund some of

<font color="#E5E5E5">those people do you see any outreach</font>

would kind of the process through the

that's not lobbying by the way that's

working with the departments and

people from the operator community do

851
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,250
play with the government people who are

852
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

853
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,750
what the actual situation is because the

854
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:44,870
the scale at which the government plays

855
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,980
and the technology with which they play

856
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:49,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know doesn't give them a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of real</font>

857
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">base to analyze when they hear things or</font>

858
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,600
to really see what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

859
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,070
internet and really understand what

860
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,090
happens by accident what could happen on

861
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,800
purpose what actually is happening

862
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,689
because they live behind a very fire

863
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,909
world world<font color="#E5E5E5"> with different kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:06,210
applications and different users I had

865
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:09,390
been involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this community for a</font>

866
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,670
few years earlier this decade and at the

867
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,710
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had the idealistic notion that</font>

868
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,840
the government could actually do some

869
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,010
good at actually helping put pressure on

870
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,260
some of the vulnerabilities that we've

871
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:21,270
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about for ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ralph</font>

872
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,220
filtering and address filtering and

873
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,379
things like that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that did</font>

874
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,820
disappoint me greatly was one of the

875
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,530
really good ideas that I thought had

876
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,780
come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that whole process which</font>

877
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:33,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mark had been involved in was the</font>

878
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:36,149
government using its purchasing power to

879
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:38,699
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say we will only buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

880
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,350
people who do certain things and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

881
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,200
instantly shot down by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lobbyists as</font>

882
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,820
soon as it was proposed and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my</font>

883
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,280
response to<font color="#CCCCCC"> todd is i think it is</font>

884
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">important that some people on some</font>

885
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,600
rotation as some as basically a charity

886
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,030
effort go and continue to provide food

887
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,030
so that Jarrod doesn't get stuck in this

888
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:59,520
role sec my question is thanks by the

889
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:01,440
way thanks I because we need some peers

890

afterwards but we'll find someone Marty

895
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,780
just trying to akamai we can look at an

896
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,940
ability of it but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know my question</font>

897
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,830
is do you see any more hope now than

898
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,480
five six years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago to the idea that</font>

899
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:24,809
government could have a constructive

900
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,029
role in helping to not legislate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not</font>

901
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:28,830
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to regulation or god help us</font>

902
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:32,669
legislation but actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

903
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:35,760
constructive role in helping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the</font>

904
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:37,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet more secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it'll work</font>

905
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,760
I don't know what you're thinking is but

906
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,100
there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are good people in</font>

907
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,019
government who want this to work one of

908
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,090
the really awkward things we find those

909
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:47,519
once they really get good at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

910
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,709
private sector buys them out and we kind

911
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,510
of have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over again and g bars</font>

912
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:54,320
on it happen to anyone in this room ya

913
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,940
know everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> hears truth loyal right</font>

914
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,200
but it but on the other hand if you go

915
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,340
back even though you in the private

916
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,659
sector you go that can work with the

917
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">federal government and kind of help them</font>

918
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:04,710
show them work with them almost a peer

919
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:06,330
relationship even though you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not on</font>

920
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,440
their payroll you're still providing

921
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the same type of insight as to</font>

922
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,010
what's going on it's just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

923
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:13,290
is is the purpose of the outreach effort

924
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,609
just mitigating bad things happening or

925
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:17,040
is there actually any hope of anything

926
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:20,129
good happen there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of threads one</font>

927
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,859
of the main ones is the particularly DHS

928
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:24,629
they want to do the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we know</font>

929
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:26,310
how it's done this is our world<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

930
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,469
what we live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in so by partnering with</font>

931
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:30,119
and we can show at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bureaucrat</font>

932
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision-makers exactly what's going on</font>

933
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">so there's no doubt about what the</font>

934
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,129
private<font color="#E5E5E5"> sector is up to help them with</font>

935
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:36,780
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision-making process now we</font>

936
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:38,759
cannot help the lobbying side

937
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,280
legislative side that has kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of its</font>

938
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,750
own momentum but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least from the</font>

939
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">executive branch if they understand what</font>

940
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the private sector is doing and what we</font>

941
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,119
do to protect ourselves our own

942
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,069
resilience it helps them with their
