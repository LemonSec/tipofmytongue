go with<font color="#CCCCCC"> some tools and not with others</font>

hey there we go next up is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy who</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really should have gotten credit for</font>

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,320
being the best bowler the other night I

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,060
did redirect the trope I don't know how

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,510
things got messed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up but he I'll bold me</font>

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,640
by a lot so whole bunches but anyhow to

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:33,930
talk about the NS sexy dns and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font>

11

here's Dwayne vessels so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is</font>

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,160
kind of a follow-up talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> suzanne's</font>

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,590
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation today this is actually</font>

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> seed root service that net you see</font>

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,920

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,520
a bit to forty percent but what's

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:30,180
troubling is this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit down</font>

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,039
here this yellow these are queries

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,899
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data is is whether those</font>

34
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:47,610
quarries also have the the do bit set

35
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,439
and this graph which is also fairly

36
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:54,570
recent this is from data in<font color="#E5E5E5"> march april</font>

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:57,408
this year shows down here that this

little this<font color="#CCCCCC"> little green bit shows that</font>

39
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:03,719
those queries that have easiness buffer

40
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,309
size 512 also have the the do bit set

41
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,020
and as we're moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> toward signing the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">root this looks like it could be a</font>

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:15,680
problem so

44
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:18,150
a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago org was signed and</font>

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,550
the folks at affiliates NPR were very

46
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,430
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share some data with us at the</font>

48
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:30,390
about is about that data so this graph

49
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:34,018
shows the the few hour period around the

50
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,779
time when they signed the the top is the

51
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:41,340
green shows UDP queries this purple

s buffer size 512 the blue shows UDP

54
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,458
responses where the truncated bit was

55
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,890
set and the red shows t speak queries

56
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,239
and it is quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear that at the time</font>

57
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,329
when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> signed there was a pretty big</font>

spike in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP Corey's coming in of</font>

59
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,489
course note that the scale here is

60
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:04,708
logarithmic so before signing they were

61
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:07,890
getting less than one tcp<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarter per</font>

62
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:13,040
second after signing<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're getting I</font>

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know by the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:23,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">is from their their note called YYZ one</font>

66
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,750
which from what I understand is not

67
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,970
necessarily their busiest snow<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,970

69
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:42,060
so this graph shows the response codes

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,700
for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP queries here something like</font>

71
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,320
eighty percent are our successful

72
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,600
responses that is there they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in X</font>

73
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,209
domains about twenty percent are and X

74
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:56,579
domains but the eighty percent are for

75
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:59,070
names that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist that obviously the data</font>

76
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,260
prior to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two signing here is very noisy</font>

77
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:04,549
and it's it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hard to draw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

78
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,549
conclusions about what's going on there

79
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:10,619
similar this this data shows the query

80
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,460
types for those for those TCP Corey's

81
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,760
coming in so we've got about sixty to

82
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,940
seventy percent a queries some MX and

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,930
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> some qua days and for comparison</font>

84
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:28,290
this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one shows the same</font>

85
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">breakdown for UDP queries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so they're</font>

86
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:36,030
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of similar although you'll notice</font>

87
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:39,390
that that in the teeth there's less MX

88
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:47,190
in the TCP and there's there's more

89
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:50,460
quantity than the TCP so we also did a

90
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:53,030
pretty simple analysis of the clients

91
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,669
sending those TCP queries using FP dns

92
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,950
and you know a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> caveats with FTD</font>

93
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:03,120
nest it hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really been updated in a</font>

94
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,560
few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it only it only</font>

95
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,830
gives you sort of rough rough ranges of

96
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,270
software versions but and again this the

97
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,000
analysis was done a couple weeks after

98
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,409
the the data was collected so that that

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,290
could perhaps account for the large

100
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,270
percentage of unknowns but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

101
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,720
percentage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was known it's sort of</font>

102
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:25,590
overwhelmingly identified as is a late

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,150

104
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,359
know since FB gns Evan hasn't been

105
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:36,590
updated x 9.4 is probably the latest

106
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:40,110
version that it that it can print out so

107
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,909
you know one interesting thing is is one

108
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,460
of the RFC's sort of says that if you're
