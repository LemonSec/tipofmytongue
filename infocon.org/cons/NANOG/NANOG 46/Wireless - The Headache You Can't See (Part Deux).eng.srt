00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,219
name is vikas khanna it's easy once we

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,440
stayed a few hundred times I'm from

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:17,279

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,480
that we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on so now I'm going</font>

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to kind of showcase some of the new</font>

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,830
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> new products that we got in</font>

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,810
and how it's working in comparison so

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,879
but before I start how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:41,790
actually work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> any form of microwave</font>

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,480
last year so quickly talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,280
why the fixed wireless business why it's

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,300
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the technology some of</font>

the lessons that we've learned to fly

<font color="#E5E5E5">max and what we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially expect</font>

23
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,930
to see going forward so you know at the

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,700
end of the day I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think everybody will</font>

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,170
agree it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dollars right</font>

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,450
so if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,710
data here and this is 2007 I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,409
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend the two thousand dollars to get</font>

29
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,389
the 2008 report but you know the

30
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,009
equipment manufacturers I mean they're

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,229
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the multi-billions now in</font>

32
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,540
terms of you know sales to their

37
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,509
three or four million and that's a good

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:37,170
blend of where a good blend between

the infrastructure challenges that they

<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're doing in the US which I'll</font>

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,049
that will potentially drive more

communities and light up facilities

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,899
there so this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning and</font>

89
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,970
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what you're also going to find</font>

90
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,359
is today what I talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically</font>

91
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">is fixed wireless but there's also</font>

92
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:42,070
mobile wireless which we're also going

93
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,829
to be exploring more so from a

94
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,600
technology perspective right again it's

95
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:49,540
fixed wireless as microwave technology

96
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,150
it's not Wi-Fi it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not UMTS not hshs</font>

97
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,350
PDA it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually my great technology</font>

98
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,239
and then the backbone network equipment

99
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,890
is still the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same but what we're finding</font>

100
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,420
today is some of the newer backhaul

101
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,700
equipment is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> mef certified and</font>

102
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,888
as a result of that we're seeing some

103
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,138
better performance better features that

104
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,690
did not exist exist just a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

105
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:09,850
so technology you know TDM<font color="#CCCCCC"> then switched</font>

106
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet announced combined frequency</font>

107
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,709
six to thirty eight gigs pretty standard

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">point to point although some vendors do</font>

109
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,530
supports and multi-point frequencies

110
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:22,350
finally really have you know enforcement

111
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,239
for qos and ultra-low latency guidelines

112
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,440
that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross wireless and this</font>

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,729
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funny considering the</font>

114
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,530
audience I'm speaking to but high

115
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:36,240
capacity and when we talk about high

116
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:39,559
capacity we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a gig a gig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,560
just want to make sure every resisting

118
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,370
so in the pre wimax world right you

119
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,050
bought this equip in you put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on a</font>

120
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,490
roof you aimed it line of sight and then

121
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">now you have internet access and you</font>

122
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,840
have 4 Meg's five MiG's whatever it is

123
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,190
no interoperability you had to stick

124
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,780
with one vendor if that vendor didn't

125
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,729
work out too bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you if they filed</font>

126
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,948
bankruptcy too bad for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're enough</font>

127
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:01,620
to get your equipment you know start all

128
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,940
over again very challenging frequencies

129
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,740
limited frequencies there again

130
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,139
unlicensed so anybody can hijack your

131
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,300
frequencies coverage typically update

132
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,910
miles capacity limited again because the

133
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,440
equipment can only manage so much a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

134
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,449
of it has to do with the RF utilization

135
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,789
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> link and you know line of sight</font>

136
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,050
is typically required and now actually

137
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,060
it's not reaching into<font color="#CCCCCC"> life they pretty</font>

138
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,280
much are employed and what you find now

139
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,229
is with the wimax<font color="#E5E5E5"> gear finally you have</font>

140
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,479
some interoperability so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I choose a</font>

141
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:29,250
vendor that<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't working out for</font>

142
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,560
whatever reason whether it be financial

technical I can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to a</font>

144
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,180
different vendor and find ways to make

<font color="#CCCCCC">the year work together we have now a new</font>

146
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,210
frequency that we're operating in the

147
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,760
five gig<font color="#E5E5E5"> bands are definitely very</font>

148
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,979
saturated now we have 365 although

149
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,570
within the 365 range we have to

150
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:48,479
potentially talk about interference with

151
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,219
radar coverage is still about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

152
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,979
miles but now we have wider coverage

153
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,940
that supposed to narrow coverage

154
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,550
capacity went from 10 megs to

155
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,240
potentially 45 megabits so huge jumps

156
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,520
first non line-of-sight support you know

157
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,930
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big problem depending where</font>

158
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,250
you are located especially in metro

159
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,650
areas you may not have direct line of

160
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,930
sight but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do some nls and you</font>

161
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,090
can still get the service overall

162
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,349
spectral efficiency so your channel

163
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,179
bandwidth across the link is actually

164
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,770
less but you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> more throughput</font>

165
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,710
and support for<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">clausen boss protocols and just overall</font>

167
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,818
improved processors again to give you

168
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:27,609
some perspective if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

169
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:29,860
the pre<font color="#CCCCCC"> wimax gear the subscriber units</font>

170
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,009
typically have an equivalent CPU of a

171
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,810
cisco 2600 so when you would have denial

172
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,430
of service attacks or other large or

173
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,900
other smaller packets come through with

174
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,159
a high rate it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kill the</font>

175
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,169
service and then what would happen is

176
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:42,669
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> would it kill the subscriber</font>

177
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,680
unit that would ripple up across the

178
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:46,060
wireless link and kill the access point

179
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,009
which would then ripple down and kill

180
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,659
everybody else so definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font>

181
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:53,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">in so with the technology this is</font>

00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:55,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's some sample photos and what</font>

183
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,460
you're going to find is it still looks

188
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,190
the challenges some old some you so this

189
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,900
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of one of my favorite slides</font>

190
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,520
because people don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a full</font>

191
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,888
grasp of what it can take to install

192
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,030
wireless gear and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as I point</font>

193
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,830
out here you know some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your tools</font>

194
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">which include cranes and helicopters</font>

195
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,639
because that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually does happen so you</font>

196
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:24,009
know while the technology and features

197
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,630
have greatly improved the physical

198
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">properties of links actually have it and</font>

199
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:32,469
therefore we're still doing a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

200
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,150
same things as we were before so on the

201
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:35,710
deployment side you know the equipment

202
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,969
installations have become easier due to

203
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,979
advances in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mounting apparatus</font>

204

everything like that to make everything

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FCC rules governing your network</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">alright not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet anyway unless you have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">proposition you still require true</font>

225

engineering so while the gear

226
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,040
potentially is getting more standardized

227
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,690
and easier to use there's an RF

228
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,130
component that really requires some

229
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,838
serious engineering there with different

230
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,510
tools and just mathematics in general

231
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,860
and the FCC still doesn't guarantee in

<font color="#E5E5E5">the into free interference-free</font>

now all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sudden you're stuck but now</font>

241
00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:00,029
we also have a new option in terms of

242
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:02,850
some bandwidth before is primarily 589

<font color="#E5E5E5">547 25 25 we have so many opportunities</font>

244

245
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,279
coexist with radars that's a big

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,230

247
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,790
there this is a photo<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

248
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,260
that represents what it actually looks

249
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,589
like this is in downtown San Jose

250
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,970
California and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have this</font>

251
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:22,320
first come first serve and you have to

252
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,970
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to coexist because that's</font>

253
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,370
what the rules say and so the advantage

254
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have with the new equipment</font>

255
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,550
is that you have a lot more flexibility

256
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,650
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of the spectrum and the options</font>

257
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use the downside is if you</font>

258
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,339
install your<font color="#E5E5E5"> new equipment then somebody</font>

259
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,770
comes and install some older equipment

260
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,180
right you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one who's going to have</font>

finding is you know with new<font color="#E5E5E5"> wimax</font>

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,860
that say this link will operate in this

286
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:31,540
frequency using this size channel

287
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,339
bandwidth to deliver this throughput

288
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,139
across the link so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

289
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:36,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering that goes up front but once</font>

290
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:38,259
the profiles have been created you

291
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:41,740
pretty much can replicating and get

292
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:43,869
through very quickly no more telnet

293
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,149
access all you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage to the lever</font>

00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:48,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> EMS and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now the field technicians you</font>

295
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:49,959
know they need some new time to

296
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,879
understand the Mutual's in the new

297
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,920
technology because what worked before

298
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:55,540
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily work the same so</font>

299
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,699
well RF characteristics are very similar

300
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:02,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">the deployment actually changes quite a</font>

301
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:05,670
bit you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiple channel sizes in</font>

302
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:08,290
wimax rights in to offer options and

303
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,719
congested RF environments you know the

304
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,569
RF environment spaces as long as it's

305
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,339
free it will continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get used by</font>

306
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:18,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">many people but what we're finding here</font>

307
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:19,990
is now you could do more with less of

308
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,730
the channel bandwidth sizes don't have

309
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,350
to be as much for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to obtain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

310
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,319
throughput as you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the deal</font>

311
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">faster you have improved improved link</font>

312
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,559
budgets and adaptive modulation to you

313
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,319

314
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:34,299
lft hem so this just makes the link in

315
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:36,248
<font color="#CCCCCC">the path much more resilient you have</font>

316
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:37,809
new radar detection algorithms to

317
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:39,429
operate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DFS fans because what</font>

318
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:41,469
happens is the radar link on the line or

319
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:42,490
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a similar path your radio</font>

320
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,860
needs to be adjusted because you

321
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,480
obviously can't change that radar and

322
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">GPS synchronization across the network</font>

323
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,869
that lowers the self induced

324
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,869
interference which existed in the past

325
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">wimax aps and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CBS are designed now for</font>

326
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,000
rapid outdoor installation again a lot

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this this information on this</font>

achieving economies of scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> and scope</font>

330
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,589
before it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very get one in somebody</font>

331
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,910
sits down they provision it and they

332
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,920
hand it off to somebody else who goes on

333
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,480
site<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually installs it now what we</font>

334
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,969
can do is you know get all this stuff

335
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,470
actually deployed in the field go over

336
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,700
the air provision the gear have those

337
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:23,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">people get out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we're</font>

338
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:26,280
done so it's improved quite a bit what's

339
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">next so you know some traditional wimax</font>

340
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,060
obligations you have your wireless

341

<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access which we've already</font>

talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here personal broadband in</font>

343
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,570
a service can be delivered<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a you know</font>

344
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,340
device and other location so for those

345
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,110
of you with your palm pre's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> iphones</font>

346
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,810
things like that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a start in</font>

347
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,580
the foundation<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know backhaul traffic</font>

348
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,530
up to 50 megabits I it recently had

349
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,970
somebody contacted me from Virginia and

350
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,189
they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to light at their little</font>

351
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,960
neighborhood because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> options is</font>

352
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,030
available for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them there weren't that</font>

353
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">good so we started talking about using</font>

354
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">this new gear and now with wimax stuff</font>

355
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,820
you get 50 megabits so it's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer</font>

356
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,510
the requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> of getting you know a</font>

357
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:06,120
smaller 8211 you know b<font color="#CCCCCC"> or g type radio</font>

358
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,200
and getting some pseudo throughput now

359
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,990
you're actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get</font>

360
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,660
native 50 megabits handle and then voice

361
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,100
and video / y max because now you have

362
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,459
end-to-end control mechanisms which

363
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,950
actually ensure good service ordering so

364
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,510
what's next you all have probably heard

365
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,460
about fixed mobile convergence right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

366
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,890
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was deutsche telekom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

367
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,150
t-mobile that had the unicellular and

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">then come inside the house or whatever</font>

369
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll switch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over to the Wi-Fi</font>

370
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,450
network and then you know if you look at

371
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,620
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new products that are</font>

372
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,950
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming to market you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

373
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,380
samsung your

374
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,670
amid the mobile internet device really

375
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,250
cool device if you've not seen it

376
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,469
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> works with wimax and Wi-Fi</font>

377
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,360
technologies as well and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

378
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,220
your fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> wimax</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ep's with the</font>

379
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,320
integrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Wi-Fi access point</font>

380
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,170
so once it actually you know uses Wi-Fi

381
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,670
inside hops onto the wimax portion then

382
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,140
it uses wimax technology micro

383
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,630
technology to actually that call it

384
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:02,080
perfect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the big thing you know</font>

385
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:04,390
you have LTE and then you have wimax<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

386
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,740
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it depends again on who you are</font>

387
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,780
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at verizon they actually</font>

388
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,550
are choosing their LTE vendors and what

389
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,589
we find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term evolution is that it</font>

390
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,569
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is what it is in the sense that</font>

391
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,970
it is just an<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension of what is</font>

392
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,460
already deployed today in many carriers

393
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,080
footprints but for a green field

394
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,790
deployment you know you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

395
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,770
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> maxon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so here's a story in</font>

396
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,959
network world recently where wimax

397
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,280
changes the lives in rural<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thailand so</font>

398
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,840
when you go to Greenfield deployments

399
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,980
depending on the economics the scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

400
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,440
scale of what you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at doing</font>

401
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,240
you know it may serve to be a better

402
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,310
proposition but there really<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a</font>

403
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,100
clear winner it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of time</font>

404
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">before the industry chooses which one</font>

405
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,920
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be and up until that time</font>

406
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:52,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the option above and that's</font>

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:53,579
it any questions not everybody at once

408
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:57,800
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an exciting topic</font>

409
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,800
wireless like the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy here doing it</font>

410
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:08,240
don't be obligated this agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anton</font>

411
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,310
capella voxel dotnet two questions one

412
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,720
v6 strategy on wimax I don't think it's

413
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,089
a problem to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what's the</font>

414
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,570
movement if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is any and the second</font>

415
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:20,640
question is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> naoko</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dad's got a lot of</font>

416
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,339
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's that are specifically</font>

417
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,800
designed for resellers and such is there

418
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,649
a similar plan or if there is what what

419
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,930
kind of shape is I take in so far as

420
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:34,440
canna provider say give me a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ugs like</font>

421
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,479
this are TPS like that on my reseller

422
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,029
tier quote unquote within this kind of

423
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,670
platform is there anything otherwise in

424
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:44,010
there nothing there yeah okay I that but

425
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,750
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the ipv6 portions so from</font>

426
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,120
