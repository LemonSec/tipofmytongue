1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
the bright side in pretend it's a golf

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:07,319
score<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm going to talk a little</font>

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,160
bit about list for those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning</font>

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,559
to sleep through yet another

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,780
introductory tutorial type session on

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,340
list you're going to be disappointed

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,079
because I have only about<font color="#E5E5E5"> four review</font>

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,810
slides and what list itself is and

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,369
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk mostly about some new</font>

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've developed to make</font>

11
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">least list easier to deploy at the sites</font>

12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,550
enough briefing on what's going on in

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF and then some probably familiar</font>

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,279
stuff about what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with the</font>

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,500
implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Polly meant there's a</font>

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,420
little bit of change their the most

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,040
press the most interesting development

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,290
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give away the secret now is</font>

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,640
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> really is work happening for</font>

20
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,860
in iOS for this implementation and then

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,120
I'll have the usual spec references with

22
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the slight twist and then some QA so uh</font>

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,780
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can i'll show you can see on the</font>

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,760
title slide this is actually the work of

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,789
a bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> people two of whom</font>

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,280
are also here namely<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew Parkman is</font>

27
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,270
here and Dave Myers here I guess I was

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,979
picked to come and give this

29
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,920
presentation because of a burning<font color="#CCCCCC"> desire</font>

30
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see Philadelphia and to visit east</font>

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,010
coast weather where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get a</font>

32
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,990
workout in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a shower all at the same</font>

33
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">time as I discovered during the hail</font>

34
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">storm yesterday that was kind of fun</font>

35
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,720
being in Northern California the weather

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,900
is really boring in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the summer so this</font>

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,450
is actually kind of an exciting change

38
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,710
anyway uh so getting back to a little

39
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,460
bit of history as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said they're going</font>

40
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be about for briefing review slides</font>

41
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,780
what provoked this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp effort</font>

42
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,570
basically there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a workshop held back</font>

43
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,700
in October<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 2006 sponsored by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IAB</font>

44
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,679
a bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people got together who were</font>

45
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,329
concerned about scaling of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

46
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,329
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> scaling of the Internet</font>

47
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,339
routing system and that's kind of what

48
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,289
originally motivated us to put the list

49
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,899
stuff together it actually came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up over</font>

50
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,079
during a dinner conversation that we had

51
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,960
back in October and it's since then no

52
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of preceded in fits and starts</font>

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,309
through various working group various

54
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,169
IETF working groups various operations

55
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,799
groups you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usual nanog you /</font>

56
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,420
cot right etc and is now actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

57
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,180
seeing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the light of day at some</font>

58
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,950
point not too distant future

59
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,440
again it was motivated by a desire to

60
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,940
scale the routing system this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

61
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,459
picture that everyone's probably seeing

62
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,709
thousand times by now actually brief

63
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,290
survey who here has seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list</font>

64
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,879
presentation before I expect to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see just</font>

65
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,500
about every hand in the room go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">good that means the review can be very</font>

67
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">short anyway as I said it was motivated</font>

68
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,950
originally by this graph you know growth

69
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,430
of the routing state it's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

70
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">right it's obviously not linear it's</font>

71
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,280
somewhere between quadratic and

72
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,340
exponential we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> according</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Jeff</font>

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,930
Houston's curve fitting and it continues

74
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,209
to proceed despite the global economic

75
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">meltdown one of the interesting things</font>

76
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,079
about the pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this graph is if</font>

77
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,959
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the period between 2001 and</font>

78
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:57,329
2002 there's a clear flattening that was

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,849
the bursting of the internet bubble we

80
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:01,349
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a similar flattening up in the</font>

81
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:04,078
upper right hand corner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide</font>

82
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,358
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though the economic decline is much</font>

83
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,440
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> pronounced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than it was back then</font>

84
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,819
that's interesting i don't know if it's

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,950
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be worried about or if it</font>

86
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,958
just reflects a different sort of

87
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,018
economic slowdown that predominantly

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,510
affected the internet in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 102 but is</font>

89
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,829
affecting everything now one comment on

90
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,690
the upper<font color="#CCCCCC"> right hand corner you see a</font>

91
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,940
spike there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and apparent decline and</font>

92
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,739
then a<font color="#E5E5E5"> resumption of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the curve that's</font>

93
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,380
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a decline that's a change</font>

94
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,380
in the data collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess Jeff lost</font>

95
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,030
one of his<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp feeds so a bunch of more</font>

96
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,630
specific routes that were contributing

97
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,340
to his count went away the curve has

98
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,489
continued up using pretty much the same

99
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,410
pattern as the saying goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have some</font>

100
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,859
good news and some bad news the good

101
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,870
news is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to plug a URL</font>

102
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I guess is visible more on there</font>

103
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,489
than it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here of a slide</font>

104
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,500
presentation that Jeff is planning to

105
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,900
give at some point in time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

106
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,849
suggests that stability of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP in</font>

107
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,980
the global routing system has actually

108
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:05,010
improved over the past year which is

109
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">something of a surprise it's it suggests</font>

110
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,590
that maybe we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry quite</font>

111
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:12,810
as much about the rate of<font color="#CCCCCC"> change causing</font>

112
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:17,639
causing problems with cpu utilization

113
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,440
memory speed etc as the saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes you</font>

114
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,570
know we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sure of our facts</font>

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,060
their quote mr. Spock from<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a famous</font>

116
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,860
star trek episode but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

117
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,570
you know the bad news is the trend is

118
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,870
still up into the right we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that</font>

119
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,090
sure about the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-home and</font>

120
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,620
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming is still hard and</font>

121
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,609
one of the nice things about list

122
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,270
because it actually makes the

123
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming problem easier to solve not</font>

124
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,650
only for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global routing system but</font>

125
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">also for sites it actually gives you</font>

126
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,090
some traffic engineering and some other

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,630
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of site pairwise source to</font>

128
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,489
destination site optimizations that you

129
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,930
can do that you really can't do with the

130
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,760
global routing system and sending more

131
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,470
specifics Dave did you have a question

132
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:05,539
or comment you will quickly stood up for

133
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:08,940
a second no was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> something good go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

134
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,490
so what is list<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it stands for</font>

135
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,560
a locator ID separation protocol it's a

136
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,260
way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the internet address space</font>

137
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,830
and creating to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> to numbering</font>

138
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,450
spaces out of it one is a set of

139
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,460
endpoint identifiers eid s for short

140
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,680
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> assigned to host they're not</font>

141
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,150
routed on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> global routing system so</font>

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,820
they don't contribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the routing</font>

143
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,159
system growth the other are a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,030
topologically assigned for most

146
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,070
practical purposes that means provider

147
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">assigns and they're used for a global</font>

the actual global routing system the BGP

149

between providers what that separation

150
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,660
allows us to do is it allows a couple

<font color="#E5E5E5">things it allows first of all it means</font>

152
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,340
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use both</font>

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,229
topologically significant numbering for

154
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,760
the routing system which is the best way

155
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,250
in fact the only way we know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

156
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,710
scale but we can also have topologically

157
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,419
independent assigned numbering for the

158
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,330
sites which allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have things</font>

159
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:09,479
like provider portability avoidance RB

160
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,250
numbering etc when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with lists</font>

161
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,639
there were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of kind of rules that</font>

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">we set for ourselves not surprisingly</font>

163
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,729
since most of the authors are Francisco

164
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,760
it's a network based solution rather

165
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:22,320
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a host based solution there are we</font>

166
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,820
don't want it but that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> was more</font>

167
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,990
driven by the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullet which is we</font>

170
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,000
lot more hosts out there than there are

171
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:31,889
core routers and in fact a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font>

178
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,500
said during I think an rrg meeting a

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,090
couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago you know deployment</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">wins you can't deploy something there's</font>

181
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,080
really no point in designing and it's

182
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">addressed family agnostic in other words</font>

183
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,050
it works for ipv4 and ipv6 and various

184
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,440
combinations of the above so this slide

185
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,960
and this ello plug for Dino all of the

186
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,030
non boring or less boring i should say

187
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,530
slides that have more than just text on

188

193
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,479
very brief overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how this works on</font>

194
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,430
the left side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide you can see a</font>

195
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,230
source right side is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> destination</font>

196
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,440
source wants to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the destination</font>

197
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:32,140
it has an eid for a particular host

198
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,820
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> the destination typically</font>

199
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,250
returned by the DNS that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you see</font>

200
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the little DNS entry here it looks just</font>

201
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">like an IP address but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not globally</font>

202
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,450
routed to get from the source to the

203
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,330
destinations it's not globally routed

204
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,680
there needs to be some sort of translate

205
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,289
it's not really a translation it's an

206
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,200
encapsulation that gives you a globally

207
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:56,380
routable routing locator<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

208
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,020
particular Eid the way that that works

209
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,030
is the source will send a packet the

210
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,370
source host sends a packet just as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

211
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,150
would send any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP open UDP packet</font>

212
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:09,910
whatever to its exit router which is a

213
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:12,609
ITR<font color="#CCCCCC"> our ingress tunnel router the ITR</font>

214
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:15,880
will then encapsulate it with an outer

215
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,040
header that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is routable and in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping</font>

216
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,350
the inner header<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has the source eid</font>

217
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,470
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> destiny ID and then an outer</font>

218
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,810
again an outer header that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a source</font>

219
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,300
locator going to a destination locator

220
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,950
which is globally routable I'll talk in

221
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,320
a minute about how it finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

222
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,870
appropriate mapping<font color="#E5E5E5"> it then sends that</font>

223
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,880
packet off into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet towards</font>

224
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever the routing destination is for</font>

225
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,830
the destination locator in this case

226
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,179
since this source<font color="#CCCCCC"> is connected to</font>

227
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,390
provider be it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to send it to</font>

228
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:48,130
provider be provider be will will route

229
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,260
it to provider ex since the destination

230
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">arlo is on provider ex is topologically</font>

231
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,720
assigns

232
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,780
network it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the destination</font>

233
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,630
the destination will look up the

234
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,430
appropriate mapping and then we'll send

235
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,930
back the response to the source which

236
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,140
then can install an entry in its cache

237
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:07,479
and then can send packets from source to

238
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,189
destination using an outer header with

239
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,680
the source and<font color="#E5E5E5"> destination locators</font>

240
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,290
added to the inner header<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has the</font>

241
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,079
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> and destination the IDS that was</font>

242
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,640
a lot to say and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully you've seen</font>

243
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,960
this as I said hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've seen</font>

244
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,449
this sort of stuff before so this is a

245
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">review if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are interested in more</font>

246

tutorial information let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we have</font>

247
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,660
tons of presentations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can point you to</font>

248
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,490
one of them a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to note down</font>

249
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,459
at the bottom the mapping entries have

250
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">some simple policy that allows the</font>

251
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,900
destination to control which of its

252
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,120
locators and others which of its entry

253
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,209
points from its providers to its site

254
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,980
are used and for what proportion of the

traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should be used the</font>

256
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,140
priorities control which are preferred

257
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,610
absolutely over others where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weight</font>

258
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,470
controls whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should be some</font>

259
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,660
proportional loading across the

00:09:53,470 --> 00:10:01,030
different locators along<font color="#E5E5E5"> with as I said</font>

261
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,880
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> previous slide I would talk about</font>

264
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,300
that's where this thing called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp alt</font>

265
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,450
comes in basically what list fault is is

266
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:17,079
it's an overlay network of tunnels we

267

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,790
advertised on an alternate logical

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,090
topology that's what we all stands for

273
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,550
of these tunnels so that something

274
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:39,550
connected to the alt virtual network can

275

277
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,500
they can get a map request from the

slides

287
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,890
or it could be just an alt router which

288
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,630
is basically could be an off-the-shelf

294
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,390
disappointed that they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

295
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,600
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of graphically how you</font>

use alt to find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> et are</font>

297
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:37,770
basically source has the source location

the source host has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PID that it's</font>

300
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:47,010
it off again to its exit router which is

301
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:49,439
a ITR the ITR has in the normal alt case

302
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,790
the ITR has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp connection energy</font>

303
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,830
every connection to the virtual network

304
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,439
it basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just routes on the</font>

305
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,600
destination eid which puts the traffic

306
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,040
on to the virtual network routed across

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,960
the virtual network to the appropriate

ETR that originated in an advertisement

309
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:08,280
or that<font color="#CCCCCC"> eid the ETR can then look at the</font>

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">map request look up the locators for the</font>

311
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,230
particular destination and return a map

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,790
reply a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to note if you</font>

313
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,680
look in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> upper right hand corner you</font>

314
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,810
can see two examples of each yards that

315
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">are advertising BG few routes into the</font>

316
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,819
alternate apology then you can see an

317
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,460
alt router that's aggregating them the

318
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,230
idea here is that the alt topology is a

319
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,630
virtual topology so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

320
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,520
dictate how it's connected it's just

321
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,960
tunnels you can check if you need to

322
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,160
move from one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the topology to</font>

323
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,960
another you just change a tunnel you

324
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,969
don't have to change who you're actually

325
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,430
connected to so we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the alt</font>

326
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,980
will be pretty well aggregated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

327
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly aggregated</font>

328
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,270
but because we can control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topology</font>

329
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,880
it can be the other thing to note is the

330
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue line at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom here that's a</font>

331
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,050
map-request that's the map reply that's

332
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,670
going back under over the underlying

333
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,490
technology I mean the underlying

334
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,740
internet topology basically from a

335
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,840
locator two locator it doesn't have to

336
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,940
go back over the alt virtual network

337
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">only the requests go that replies do not</font>

338
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,879
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this map server basically it's the</font>

339
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,379
easy way to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to alt one of the</font>

340

complaints we got when we came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,490
the alt spec was you guys are talking

about doing you know making<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing</font>

343
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,870

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,269
about doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming at least we've</font>

347
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,250
with all BGP well a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people know</font>

348
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:38,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just as difficult as much of a</font>

349
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,889
pain as regular BGP so what map server

350
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,259
does is it actually allows you to move

351
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:47,040
the DGP function into the alt routers

352
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:51,360
only and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use analogously to map</font>

resolvers and map server or DNS servers

354
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,069

365
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:28,110
there is a we use a IPSec authentication

to a map server which then is what what

00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:59,759
propagates it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the alt again</font>

the next slide is that the ITR is

432
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,420
it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> will strip off the outer</font>

will then take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original map request</font>

435
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,070
that was generated forwarded across the

436
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,960
all to a map server which will then put

437
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,429
in a dick but another header back on it

438
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,790
because it needs to route to

the the five core documents have all

will be quick Dave Vince I just want to

692
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,940
know do you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> offhand if there's is</font>

693
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,889
based on open list or is it entirely

694
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,390
independent it's entirely independent

695
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:38,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's interesting it actually runs</font>

696

on either linux or ns3 oh cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh 11</font>

comment kind of referring to the last

00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,660
presentation we hope that this will not

699
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">be an overnight success that takes seven</font>

you're next yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yada yada co</font>

702
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">ericsson so i had a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about the IPF</font>

704
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,730

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,280
the additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> information is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

multipath TCP which is basically

714
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:20,409
something that looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a regular TCP</font>

715
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,990
for applications but it's actually

716
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:27,490
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP sessions between address</font>

718
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">different trade off of of a solution</font>

719
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:37,299
than than less but it basically allows

720
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:39,699
you to pump more data through then you

721
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:43,320
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with as a single TCP</font>

722
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:46,539
session if you had multiple interfaces

723
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,090
so that's one thing that is is possibly

724
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:50,650
happening and the request part is is

725
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,809
that if you care about this space please

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,830
something here that that cuts down on

caching at the resolver which would

774
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,350
eliminate the delay for all the clients

775
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,270
of a particular resolver that need to

776
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,310
talk to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the sites that have been</font>

00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:04,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">things to note is that unlike like a DNS</font>

basically entire sites so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time anybody behind a</font>

particular resolver contacts Google

00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,510
anybody else that's using that resolver

785
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:20,640
would not suffer the first packet delay

786
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,800
but no we're not looking at doing we're

787
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,770
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at holding packets or trying</font>

to propagate them we<font color="#CCCCCC"> the alt spec does</font>

789
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,940
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of a data probe</font>

790
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,520
where you can actually forward the

791
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,590

792
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we can certainly consider</font>

793
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:39,540
if the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet delay is a major</font>

794
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,100

00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,100
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad scalability properties</font>

796
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,709
but I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said we're looking at adding</font>

797
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,770
more caching at the edge at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the map</font>

798
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,380
resolver to deal with that as for dos

799
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:56,010
attacks well the existence of the map

since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs don't have direct access</font>

808
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,580
like DNS resolvers map resolvers can be

809
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,409
any cast so that gives you a way to

810

spread out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> das attack among multiple</font>

812
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,340
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question it actually is</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be worth discussing</font>

on the list mailing list

00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,800
if you're doing caching that's great

00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what I was okay we're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it right now but with something that is</font>

with something we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">keep it very simple does not call for</font>

821
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,390
caching because there are some

differences<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the implement caching</font>

823
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:46,020
then you have to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the request</font>

response dynamics so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resolver</font>

instead of simply forwarding the request

826
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,149
it actually has to carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> state for every</font>

827
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:54,510
request so that it can receive that

00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,770
replies and cash them we've had that

829
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,740
we've got some ideas on how to do that

830
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,090
the map server map resolve respect does

831
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,980
allude to that but we're not

841
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:33,750
first step for everything yep so slide

842
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:36,659
10 please so I see etrs registering site

843
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:40,320
eid prefixes with only a pairwise trust

844
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:43,020
model and maybe having eaten the green

845
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,210
berries on one bush and making a really

846

bad stomach<font color="#CCCCCC"> ache makes me leery of all</font>

847
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:50,120
berries on all bushes but that sure

848
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:53,489
sounds like origin authentication

849
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,770
validation necessary being my answers

850
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:58,290
yet another protocol right now I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:01,320
than a decade from retirement maybe this

852
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:04,230
is just good fodder for interesting

00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,750
stuff to work on for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay well you</font>

854
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:08,490
know let me let me let me refer back

855
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,220
actually to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original spec on that</font>

856
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:13,259
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the authentication</font>

857
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,209
mexico's we're using bgp we basically on

858
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the alt will be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

859
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,920
advantage of whatever bgp authentication

860
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">mechanism is a mechanism is created for</font>

861
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,180
origination at the point where a map

862
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:28,190
server receives the request from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a map</font>

864
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,490
we're not trying to solve that problem

865
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:35,070
on our own because there's been tens of

866
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:38,819
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work already on things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SPG</font>

certificate delegation all that stuff

870
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:48,210
that's all equally applicable to all bgp

871
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:51,029
as it is to global bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when the</font>

872
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:54,530
map server starts advertising the prefix

873
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:56,760
yep they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be doing it in BGP</font>

874
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,500
announcements with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same sort of</font>

875
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,370

00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:05,430
work applies on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all correct and and</font>

the authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> header between the</font>

between the administrators<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,800
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that good is that your answer is</font>

00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that what you're looking for I sure hope</font>

883
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,590
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great two more questions and</font>

884
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are way over time so we're going</font>

885
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:27,960
to quit after that yes hey Parker given

886
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:31,620
how long locator ID stuff has been

887
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,600
chatted about with a desire to pursue it

888
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,940
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to see this kind of</font>

889
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,830
progress on something pragmatic well

890
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,560
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's something that's been</font>

891
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:43,650
talked about for since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1960s</font>

892
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,049
actually more recently in about 20 years

893
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:48,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago when the whole I PNG effort was</font>

894
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:50,820
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> along</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> milk kappa talked about it</font>

895
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,830
the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> invented ipv6 kind of</font>

896
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,660
totally missed the boat on this and now

897
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,680
we've decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

898
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's really fundamental that</font>

899
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have to now retro fit in and that's</font>

900
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,900
what we're trying to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> continues</font>

901
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,520
yeah these v6 largely dodged the

902
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,850
question of being created with with

903
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,790
addressing and and the stuff back 20

904
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:10,560
years ago that was frustrating was they

905
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:12,420
were there were ideas but there were

906
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,190
details and he can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

907
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,680
decisions about without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the details</font>

908
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,090
right and one interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to note</font>

909
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">of course is that one of our co author</font>

910
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,390
is no kappa who's been a great proponent

911
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:25,140
of this over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> years did notice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

912
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:28,710
yes in looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> over some of the</font>

913
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:32,089
documents they're all appropriately

914
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:36,420
technical and focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the how and</font>

915
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:38,650
what it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come across and what</font>

916
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,110
might actually help

917
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,960
the recruitment effort and later the

918
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,820
adoption effort is something which is

919
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,300
essentially a non technical document

920
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:51,460
that talks about value proposition and

921
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:54,130
cost-benefit where the cost part is

922
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:57,130
designed to address people's fears so

923
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:59,890
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example the use of DNS for lookups</font>

924
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:02,200
with packet handling was a huge fear in

925
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:04,029
the discussion 20 years ago and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

926
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,890
overcome that and but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

927
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,950
run into all sorts of resistant because

928
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:09,940
it's a deep psychological point right

929
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:13,600
we're already seeing that on various

930
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:16,090
manless sure but but a fairly brief

931
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,400
discussion which says here here are the

932
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:21,670
benefits being pursued and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

933
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,560
costs we think we have under control do

934
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,060
I detect a volunteer<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I knew you</font>

935
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,580
were going to say I would love I would

936
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,650
as I've heard said before I would

937
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,060
welcome suggested test<font color="#CCCCCC"> suits and why</font>

938
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,260
would welcome to suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want even</font>

939
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,910
collaborate but I don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

940
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,020
any of the details here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I can't</font>

941
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:38,640
say anything but I'm certainly willing

942
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:42,460
to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay contact us offline</font>

943
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,440
last question Ron<font color="#CCCCCC"> bonica one of the</font>

944
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,260
things that traditionally is made IP

945
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,150
unicast 40 well rather work so well is

946
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,730
that things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen in the</font>

947
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,410
forwarding plane don't cause state to be

948
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,330
creating things that happen in the

949
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:58,000
boarding plane don't cause control state

950
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:59,350
to be created<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay list may bend that</font>

951
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,760
rule a little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

952
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,860
caches that are required that you need

953
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be built and when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a cash you</font>

954
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,460
have to worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it being overrun and</font>

955
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,500
being attacked all that sort of thing if

956
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:12,220
you given thought the how you deal with

957
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,870
the problems of caching I'm not really

958
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right person asked that question but</font>

959
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,049
yes we have and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dino in particular has</font>

960
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:20,650
because he's done<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the implementation</font>

961
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:22,900
work but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean certainly at</font>

962
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,810
the IP layer what you said is<font color="#CCCCCC"> true that</font>

963
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,070
there aren't dependencies for unicast

964
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,720
but if you look at our PI mean art by

965
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:31,060
definition is<font color="#E5E5E5"> state this created on</font>

966
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,980
demand and is a cash well so there is a

967
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,680
there is a precedent for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that model</font>

968
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:38,260
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit different because you</font>

969
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,569
only are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your neighbor you don't do that</font>

970
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">much arcing because you don't</font>

971
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:43,769
that many neighbors whereas I think

972
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:46,859
enlist you have to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> state whenever</font>

973
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:49,348
you send a packet to a new destination

974
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:52,170
that may be multiple hops away to a new

975
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:54,329
destination site remember the cache

976
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:57,329
entries cover more than just individual

977

prefect in the individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> /</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 tues well</font>

978
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's apparently unbounded number</font>

979
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:02,279
isn't it though you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if this were</font>

980
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,949
globally deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'd be lots and</font>

981
00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:08,579
lots of destination sites there would be

982
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:11,459
on the order of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300,000 today assuming</font>

983
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:13,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't do any aggregation we believe</font>

984
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:14,549
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a man I mean that's clearly a</font>

manageable number in the global routing

986
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:19,109

987
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:22,549
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be a lot smaller when when</font>

988
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:25,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do reasonable aggregation of e IDs</font>

989
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:28,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">so yes we are aware that caching has a</font>

00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,900
cache entries is much smaller and they

998
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:49,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to be requested nearly as</font>

999
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:51,150
often so I we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's doable I</font>

1000
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:53,789
mean one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

1001
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:55,049
excuse or experimental RFC proposals is

1002
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:57,089
because there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of experimentation</font>

1003
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:58,979
to be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with a lot of operational</font>

1004
00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:00,959
experience we have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit we have</font>

1005
00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:04,729
a lot more to gain one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that might</font>

1006
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:07,319
help is if we could shed some light on

1007
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:09,629
what elements of caching work well and

1008
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:11,699
which ones don't work well and maybe

1009
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,440
explain away the bad experience that we

1010
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:15,299
already have with caching it's a good

1011
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,449
suggestion on one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I will note is</font>

1012
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:21,420
that the folks down at UCL and Belgium

1013
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:24,809
actually did do a study of you know kind

1014
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">of cash dynamics and prefix prevalence</font>

1015
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:28,499
and how many things a typical site needs

1016
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,269
to actually contact and the numbers

1017
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:32,848
actually much smaller than you'd expect

1018
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:34,769
so the cash according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their study the</font>

1019
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:36,479
cache sizes are actually going to be

1020
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:37,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">much smaller than even we expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1021
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:39,239
security analysis would also be

1022
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,598
interesting because the cash is a good

1023
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:42,859
thing

1024
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,269
back sure all good suggestions please I

1025
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:49,308
welcome the discussion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF let</font>

1026
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:52,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">the little I'd IETF melons that's it</font>

1027
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:52,549
enjoy the break
