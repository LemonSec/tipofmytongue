1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:10,769
good morning hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's awake</font>

2
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:13,740
we're I'm going to talk a little bit but

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:17,539
by my experience with with introducing

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:22,140
their satellite technology for it was

5
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:29,150
started out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago now in</font>

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,150
1999 in a coffee shop in Colorado so

7
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,960
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a brief agenda will go through</font>

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,340
the history then I'll show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a little</font>

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,670
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of deployments and some future</font>

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:45,570
development of<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology will basically</font>

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">where we're going from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here so we have</font>

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,460
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back in time and I'm sure there's</font>

13
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,460
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were there that time I</font>

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:58,370
see familiar faces around here it was

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:01,440
like 1998-99 there was a big rush to

16
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,269
deploy bandwidth because people believe

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd be running out of bandwidth</font>

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,630
within one or two years didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,760
turn out that way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then but we still</font>

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,740
have grown<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a bit since then and we</font>

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,200
ATM was was what we were deploying at

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,419
that time and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember it was it</font>

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,290
was expensive and maximum speed was

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,909
ossia<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelves and you know support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gates</font>

25
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,840
was on the horizon<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was going to</font>

26
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,329
be really expensive and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,700
needed to find some alternative it was

28
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:39,179
cheaper and maybe packet-based i'll sell

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,210
base since it already was very clear at

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,610
least in most people minds that that IP

31
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,380
was going to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world and</font>

32
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,460
there would be any ATM left after a

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,199
while so we were building a<font color="#E5E5E5"> network on</font>

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,610
the ground up right all packet based

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,670
services mpls was was an emerging

36
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,340
technology we didn't have a l3 VPN it

37
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,670
wasn't really popular but at a time you

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">know mpls was believed to be a better</font>

39
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,970
for forwarding because we make

40
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,280
forwarding simpler now it turns out that

41
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,460
because I p is really what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,620
forward we

43
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,140
actually build devices that forward IP

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,300
just fine and don't have trouble you

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,489
know much trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP although we</font>

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,950
have you know some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of routing table</font>

47
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:28,180
size issue these days but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

48
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">on that as well so in 98 and 99 we</font>

49
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,770
believe that mpls was was actually a

50
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,680
great idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move forward in the future</font>

51
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:38,410
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to actually as you know create</font>

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,410
new telecom market competition and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

53
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:46,049
new services<font color="#E5E5E5"> which would be a cheaper to</font>

54
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:48,850
deploy and make them widely available so

55
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,980
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said before you know the classical</font>

56
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,530
free meal ATM design was expensive

57
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,750
people built separate networks every

58
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,570
time you had to deploy one new service

59
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,690
year to deploy new network that that was

60
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:04,780
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost-effective didn't quite scale as</font>

61
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,570
far as a support as well so we want a

62
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,460
multi-service backbone and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old part</font>

63
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,100
is that this was you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> would for a</font>

64
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:15,370
service provider at the time so we

65
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">really wanted to use existing happier if</font>

66
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,980
as much as a you know proposition who

67
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,079
try and create something that would try

68
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use existing hardware that then start</font>

69
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,810
over and deploy a whole new network and

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,550
then deploy the service and that we

71
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,740
wanted a multiple better implementation

72
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:37,060
so that we would have you know

73
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:40,300
competition and the protocol get more

74
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,480
popular anything that's in historically

75
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,850
anything it's been kept close to you

76
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,049
know proprietary or fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> close as</font>

77
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,400
really not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone very far you know and</font>

78
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,610
it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> replaced eventually but</font>

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:04:00,100
something that's easier and more open

80
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:02,650
standard so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what how do we design</font>

81
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are so-called rough martini</font>

82
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:09,610
which is what what ended up being very

83
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:13,269
popular name<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually it had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

84
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:15,460
simple protocol I mean I had two people

85
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,320
would have to read it and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> well this</font>

86
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,540
is not the difficult let me just write

87
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,719
it up in a weekend or

88
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,030
thing and and do it you know you have to

89
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">use existing haggar and possible and</font>

90
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,109
we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see this in a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

91
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,130
in the capsulation if you ever ask

92
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,200
yourself who's white you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> did people</font>

93
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,090
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell walls with certain types of</font>

94
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,500
encapsulation and how the decision were

95
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,310
made to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should pick the</font>

96
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,710
encapsulation well one day criteria was

97
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,390
to say well what you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do when you</font>

98
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,789
put forward IP packet you basically

99
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,070
receive an IP packet you do a lookup you

100
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,010
rewrite the header and then you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

101
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,530
out the number port and and so this had

102
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,570
to do the similar thing so you had to to

103
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,669
basically you know receive the packet

104
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,490
rewrite<font color="#E5E5E5"> the head and put up in a report</font>

105
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,890
like inserting data for example was a

106
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,680
function that isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> Houston IP you don't</font>

107
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,900
really grow the packet in the router and

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,270
so that was something we couldn't use so

109
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,710
we had to to try and avoid functions

110
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,450
like that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> its hardware wouldn't</font>

111
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,739
support you now today's is no longer a

112
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,300
problem you could do whatever you want

113
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,770
in a packet processor but at the time it

114
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:25,260
was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more limited so we wanted to</font>

115
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">leverage mpls because we saw that as</font>

116
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,750
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future a very simple system</font>

117
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,680
and we could build a multi core network

118
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:38,190
with qos and all sort of secret based

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,160
you know designs or best effort designs

120
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,630
hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> ihop forwarding all of that was</font>

121
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,310
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mpls and you can just</font>

122
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,650
choose whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you with model you want</font>

123
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:50,130
and that suits<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad that's your your</font>

124
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:52,409
requirements so they were thing is we

125
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,390
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support existing service product</font>

126
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,270
protocol like you know ATM for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> malay</font>

127
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:01,620
ethernet at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had marketing</font>

128
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,260
people bugging me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a new cool</font>

129
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,000
protocol to run to the cpe<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

130
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,280
like mpls or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">resist that for many years because I</font>

132
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,049
just didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the advantage over</font>

133
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to you know do something new just</font>

134
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,960
to be different you know it since there

135
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,680
was no real technical or financial

136
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:32,039
advantage to doing

137
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:35,940
okay there's windows okay and and they

138
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">were part that you probably are you know</font>

139
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,380
fairly close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer so you to</font>

140
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,690
your search by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> custom so you</font>

141
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,760
understand better than a lot more over

142
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,190
people it is really the operational

143
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,490
mother is very important trying to go

144
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,500
and and sell a new operational model you

145
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,830
know that's not based on circuit at the

146
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,960
time okay and the new protocol any new

147
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,880
service and all that is much harder than

148
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,890
to go to somewhere and say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

149
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,570
just buy the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing as your t1</font>

150
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:06,830
circuits except now they're cheaper and

151
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,840
more flexible<font color="#CCCCCC"> and faster now of course</font>

152
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,460
you know now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a free VPN which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

153
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">never really thought it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be that</font>

154
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">popular but you know it is it is</font>

155
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:20,210
technically better than just a secret of

156
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:25,530
course but it was much more difficult to

157
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:28,560
to sell and explain so what was the

158
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,330
result well you know we had a lot of

159
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,600
vendors interoperate very quickly

160
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it was simple and</font>

161
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,640
easy-to-implement and<font color="#E5E5E5"> accommodated many</font>

162
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,650
hard work works at the time then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

163
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:46,260
know i stopped counting 2001 there was

164
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:50,130
no point after that we chosen a chosen I

165
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,940
for because I really like the way LEP

166
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:56,070
was built with<font color="#E5E5E5"> T lbs you know extensible</font>

167
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,350
design you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just set a bit if you</font>

168
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,849
have to send a new message that an old

169
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,350
device might not understand your set a

170
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,600
bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's supposed to ignore it</font>

171
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,250
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather nice if you do an</font>

172
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,710
upgrade you don't end up with something

173
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,510
closing their link or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know shutting</font>

174
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,659
down the session just because they don't

175
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:16,500
understand something so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can design</font>

176
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,960
new things to basically be graceful to

177
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:24,900
older implementation in deployment so

178
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:28,380
you don't you end up with with issues we

179
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,330
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I initially as tested</font>

180
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,729
only with point-to-point links because

181
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,189
it really was similar to what a key I'm

182
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:37,320
family it was easy to sell its what

183
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,789
people were requesting and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font>

184
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:46,620
there's a lot of that being requested

185
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:50,130
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for to transport void internet and</font>

186
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,770
so forth we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pls because what to</font>

187
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,140
do multi services we still had to the

188
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,110
you know to support ATM and family on

189
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:01,800
this network end as well support

190
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,630
internet the new the new transport that

191
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">was was getting very popular was</font>

192
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,920
internet actually at the time I really

193
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,440
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the most popular would be</font>

194
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:16,400
ATM<font color="#CCCCCC"> in family and I never thought it</font>

195
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:19,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be but I turn out to be wrong so</font>

196
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,600
the devil<font color="#CCCCCC"> part is the service management</font>

197
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,850
you know the granule Arctic scalability

198
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise really this is an interesting</font>

199
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,350
feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> mpls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it sometimes people don't</font>

200
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,500
think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it as</font>

201
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:34,830
granular as putting one a recipe te LSP

202
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,530
per customer link or a perfect customer

203
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:40,110
connection or you can make one for you

204
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:44,520
know of all the whole PE so you really

205
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:46,590
have a flexibility to to do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

206
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">want as far as managing your traffic</font>

207
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,540
where it goes and and so forth something

208
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not built into the protocol it's</font>

209
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,569
it's a policy the service provider can

210
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:00,089
can can heaven and I've seen you know

211
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,600
all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things from 1 SPT tunnel</font>

212
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:07,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">per set a wire to you know no other</font>

213
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,680
speaky all and just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> based LSPs</font>

214
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,620
and so forth so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interesting</font>

215
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,349
experience when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started this I</font>

216
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,270
talk to ya corrector at the time and he

217
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,030
said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can put this in the</font>

218
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,100
ATF but I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I cannot tell you</font>

219
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">what will happen at the other end of the</font>

220
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,720
process it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know completely</font>

221
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">change you might nothing might be</font>

222
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,680
changed and so forth so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

223
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,220
show you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit what the</font>

224
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,390
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happen in the ATF and</font>

225
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,790
you know I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in green here a little</font>

226
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,810
bit my estimate of what actually was

227
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,769
popular what deployed or not

228
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,599
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing that happened</font>

229
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:48,500
is I must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have believed in the doc in</font>

230
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,600
him at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least like 10 or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 times many</font>

231
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,190
many times<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was really fun of course</font>

232
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,300
first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened they change</font>

233
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:59,019
the terminology we we had the initial

234
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:03,380
meetings and and they didn't like

235
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:05,269
virtual circuits and and so they they

236
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,880
wanted to call this something else and

237
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:11,540
they called it set of wires and the VC

238
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,910
ID became a pw ID and so forth so it

239
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,410
wasn't too bad I didn't mind you know

240
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,670
didn't quite care about what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

241
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:21,469
called we did actually managed to remain

242
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,569
a hundred percent backward compatible if

243
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,779
you go to they have see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the dark</font>

244
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:31,639
martini which is a historical RFC was

245
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:34,189
published after the LFC 444 service or

246
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,260
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the number but you see that</font>

247
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,310
it's really backward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the percent you</font>

248
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,439
can still have an implementation

249
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,760
implemented this and work today<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

250
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,230
have all the features of course but

251
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:49,310
it'll still work what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a move at I did I</font>

252
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:52,220
tfd it is a defect 129 to you know get a

253
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:56,089
few over different provisioning models

254
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,889
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like sort of our</font>

255
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:00,350
status which is kind of missing in a

256
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:02,360
initial design<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree and that's that's</font>

257
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much deployed everywhere so we</font>

258
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">send the status of of what the endpoints</font>

259
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,449
are along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seller wire with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the added</font>

260
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:13,519
fermentation you know IP fermentation is

261
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:14,689
very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done in a router so</font>

262
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,389
you can imagine it's a dawat

263
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,069
fragmentation is even harder

264
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:20,779
fermentation reassembly and so there's

265
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:21,949
really very difficult to do in have

266
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,649
grand therefore that you know this

267
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:27,279
hasn't really been deployed anywhere the

268
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:30,709
Wildcats are wire was doing integrate

269
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:34,850
pin and I ATM PIN and I with cellular

270
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:37,760
signaling and that was didn't get

271
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,649
popular because<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin and I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

272
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,490
little deployment so it kind of died

273
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:46,579
before this this had a chance and we did

274
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:50,209
many specialty musicians for ATM this

275
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:53,899
was really new to a lot of vendor

276
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:55,849
and so forth for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and so they</font>

277
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:59,179
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDF solution was to standardize all</font>

278
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,339
of them which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would try to avoid if I</font>

279
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:04,339
were to do this again<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if nothing</font>

280
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">else is because they were there's very</font>

281
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:08,959
little bit moment of the strange a kien

282
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:11,569
modes right now but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some and</font>

283
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,388
it's mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> ER because nobody told those</font>

284
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:17,779
those particular vendors that you know

285
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:21,410
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the mode that is popular it</font>

286
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,449
just got a little bit confusing so but

287
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,819
it's not too bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then of course</font>

288
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's the ester tension there are some</font>

289
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:30,139
folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there that don't build a</font>

290
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,629
router with ECC memory and so they crop

291
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:34,429
packets what before we get for the full

292
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:38,509
of the routers so you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> always ask</font>

293
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:41,839
your vendor if he has ECC memory and and

294
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:43,970
so somebody wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add a frame</font>

295
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,129
check sequence in the packet so that

296
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,920
they settle our packet cross the router

297
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:50,689
would corrupt packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you detected this</font>

298
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,759
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really necessary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in most of the</font>

299
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:57,649
major deployment out there have methods

300
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,720
to detect any kind of the internal

301
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:02,809
collection and so forth a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

302
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,600
things minor things but basically the

303
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:07,759
design was was extended from what we

304
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,779
started with added a few a lot more

305
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,759
modes and it kind of progressed that way

306
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:16,069
now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a summary interesting part</font>

307
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,829
experience oops if I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> known what i</font>

311
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,420
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does it do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically makes sure</font>

312
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,399
that both handles of SATA wire have the

313
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,439
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> into you so that you don't end up</font>

314
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,589
with a terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> operational headache</font>

315
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:40,998
like a thank you Miss match where one

316
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:42,799
one side of the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know of the seller</font>

317
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:45,139
wire has smaller with you than the other

318
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,869
side and you know you could end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in</font>

319
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:49,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">situations where you load a webpage and</font>

320
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:52,189
everything loads except the images now

321
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,660
you your customer goes crazy because it

322
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:56,420
has a figure out how his images are not

323
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:59,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">loading and you know gets due to your</font>

324
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">your 1st level support and you know</font>

325
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:02,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and they have time figuring out</font>

326
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and so</font>

327
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:08,079
I for that I could this interface

328
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,779
parameters now it turns out that people

329
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,790
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not broken right now they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

330
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:15,850
care too much they want to just disable

331
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:18,339
it and and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of very crappy</font>

332
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,230
code where people have patched and to

333
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:23,230
use and and what the interface does

334
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,029
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what it's got capable of</font>

335
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,859
and so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah interface that report</font>

336
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:30,309
empty or 1500 bytes but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do</font>

337
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:33,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">3000 and and so forth so so that kind of</font>

338
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:36,639
turn out to be a big headache and and so

339
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:39,339
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I still have a</font>

344
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,329
unfortunately it just happens that both

00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:54,249
in the cisco and juniper there is a

346
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:55,929

00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:59,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually break your network if you want</font>

349
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:04,989
sounded<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a good idea it didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

350
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,759
out that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last one is a</font>

357
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,589
this out until like three years later

358
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,360
when everybody had deployed s already

359
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,889
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean of course you know it was a</font>

360
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,679
big argument but we said well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

361
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:35,769
it was deployed yes we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font>

362
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:38,230
this proposal function which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as</font>

363
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:40,449
efficient we should do but we never

364
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,540
really changed that so that was kind of

365
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:45,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">a an embarrassing oversight there but</font>

you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> three malaise is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not exactly</font>

367
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:53,289

368
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:56,100
deal anymore so a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployment</font>

369
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:59,289

emerging the<font color="#E5E5E5"> permits is just one flavor</font>

371
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:05,349
of it right now this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a real</font>

372
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:07,299

00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:10,119
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a metro eternal</font>

do a time at war

376
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:17,310
to aggregate no beads which are cell

378
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:24,899
in this cases is a small appliance box

379
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:27,780
that will either take<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATM and put it ATM</font>

380
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,760
oversell wire or do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret emulation</font>

381
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,860
over the set of wires this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cab type</font>

382
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">and seller wires we have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight metric</font>

383
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:38,790
to the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and goes to a head and</font>

384
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:45,120
router 7600 here that will then put it

385
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:50,659
back out as TD me1<font color="#CCCCCC"> zor a km / STM once</font>

386
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:53,129
and this is used because there is a huge

387
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:56,730
basically a huge growth in the mobile

388
00:17:53,130 --> 00:18:00,960
wireless and unfortunately the 3g

389
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:04,440
specification is done over ATM and it's

390
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,110
still the main deployment of technology

391
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,590
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four G's much at</font>

392
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:13,889
all yet and so we're growing ATM

393
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,770
networks in 2009 and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

394
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,960
extremely expensive and so what happened

395
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,980
is is if people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really looking to</font>

396
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,600
take those packets which are over ATM we

397
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,040
assemble them into packets and send them

398
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,980
over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat them in network instead of</font>

399
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:32,940
ATM and so so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could never have</font>

400
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,890
forecasted but it it turns out that the

401
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,080
biggest you know the flow mean outside

402
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,900
of Ethernet set of wires is ATM now

403
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:46,439
because of this particular application

404
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:50,370
here the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is just a you know</font>

406
00:18:50,370 --> 00:19:00,989
a you know a service provider that is

407
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:06,960
using vpls 22 with us and what what's

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:09,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening is is actually super yes this</font>

is the rice glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have reversed and</font>

00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:16,429
used to bridge over this and so you have

432
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do you know point your point layer</font>

433
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:21,110
two tunnels so you can clear out their

434
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,330
distances and so forth and so what you

435
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,979
do is you you make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call it</font>

436
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,840
you know sometimes people call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> hollow</font>

437
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">core where you can just run settle wires</font>

438
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,110
over your core and you have complete

439
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:36,830
separation between your customer data

440
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,959
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your core so you your customer</font>

441
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:44,658
routing runs on top of your core either

442
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:47,240
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> L free VPN or by being inside a vpls</font>

443
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:50,630
or all inside of SATA wire so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

444
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,899
this is another very popular deployment

445
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:57,590
it's a it both in service providers and

446
00:20:53,899 --> 00:21:03,340
in in enterprises I've seen this

447
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:06,590
University's many many places<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

448
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:11,149
next I want to to kind of go over a

449
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:12,470
little bit the new development one of

450
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:16,520
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we didn't focus</font>

451
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:19,460
initially and we we kind of didn't think

452
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,100
that we go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider or add between</font>

453
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:25,429
different regions or areas with this and

454
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:27,678
so what we came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a solution is</font>

455
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:29,390
called multi cycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wire where</font>

456
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,799
it's a similar exactly backward

457
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,340
compatible and the same as the initial

458
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,490
side

459
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,379
wire so the TP one could be an old p

460
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,540
that doesn't really know anything about

461
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">this technology and still work just fine</font>

462
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,580
and it will what we do is we terminate

463
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:45,620
the control plane at SB<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 in this</font>

464
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,770
example and then we start a new control

465
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:51,320
plane and so forth along the way they

466
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:54,770
said as ability to have a policy

467
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,149
enforcement point at a certain point has

468
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,220
one row back that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

469
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,110
configure every single hop so you have

470
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,990
to go figure the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4ps in this particular</font>

471
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,600
picture which is kind of undesirable in

472
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,570
certain cases depending on what your

473
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,810
policy is so in order to fix that what

474
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:16,189
we did is is I kind of followed a little

475
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:18,050
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the apms PVC model and said okay</font>

476
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:22,850
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assign a unique global</font>

477
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:24,800
unique address in at each end of the set

478
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,750
of water so I attachments<font color="#E5E5E5"> equity which</font>

479
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the end of the set of wire and then</font>

480
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,360
what we'll do is we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> take those</font>

481
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:35,300
prefixes similar like ipv6 this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 96</font>

482
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,919
bits and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just advertise mounting</font>

483
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,649
some routing protocol and there's a

484
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,380
choice you know bgp ospf ice is so forth

485
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:46,130
and and then what we'll do is we'll just

486
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:48,020
route the signaling message we just take

487
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,580
a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> message you know send it to</font>

488
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,139
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do a lookup on the</font>

489
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,120
address and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I keep sending a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single a</font>

490
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,820
message and we still have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> separate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

491
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,189
the only thing gets routed like IP is a

492
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:01,340
signaling message once that's end to end

493
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,350
reply comes back along the same path we

494
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,740
end up with the secret again now if the

495
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,659
routing changes unlike IP we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

496
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change right away we can just sit</font>

497
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,010
there forever or we can buy policy say

498
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,510
yeah I'll wait 30 seconds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

499
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:19,370
optimized and things of that so I'm

500
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:23,120
similar to what I recipe does I guess

501
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:25,790
but it's a hop by hop routing of it the

502
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,479
signaling message with a globally unique

503
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:32,270
address which I've learned from lv VPN

504
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,020
it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you must have the</font>

505
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,200
s number<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top bits like they you</font>

506
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,720
know they are the inner teen

507
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,429
VPN which didn't quite say that and so

508
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,039
everybody kind of went a different way

509
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:49,529
so now we end up with FD translation

510
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:52,919
tables so a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can do</font>

511
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:55,049
with this is is basically you can now

512
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,450
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a dynamically player</font>

513
00:23:55,049 --> 00:24:00,000
choosing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the appealing point you</font>

514
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:02,309
can actually if you have a break in one

515
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,370
of the cell walls you can re signal

516
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:06,600
through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different path you know lots</font>

517
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">of different things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do this</font>

518
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,529
might not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> as fast but the rubber</font>

519
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:14,730
tricks that are faster so we we kind of

520
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:16,740
opened it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the problem to to all</font>

521
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,940
sort of different solutions that we can

522
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,210
do depending on what the requirements

523
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,309
are last example fairly quickly so

524
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">hopefully this is can be it's a little</font>

525
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:30,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to read but i wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

526
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:33,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">say I've put a lot of OEM support into</font>

527
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:36,149
this system we can this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a BCC we</font>

528
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,750
trace example this series done some

529
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:41,489
virtual circuit connection verification

530
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:44,760
where we can since we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a single</font>

531
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:46,799
circuit what we do is we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at every</font>

532
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">heart verify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what the control point</font>

533
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,549
says is exactly what the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> claim does</font>

534
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:55,500
so we we built this and many over sort

535
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:58,559
of our status messages and so forth so

536
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,649
it's really very easy for operation oi

537
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,200
to to understand where the problem is if

538
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:06,389
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a failure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get notified that</font>

539
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,250
the NP exactly what the failure is and

540
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:10,918
what is happening and then you can use

541
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:16,049
to like this trace to verify that the

542
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:18,179
path is correct and so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

543
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:21,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">last topic I wanted to just mention</font>

544
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:25,710
quickly is it's been getting quite a lot

545
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:28,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> press today is mpls-tp so how does it</font>

546
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:31,740
relate to upsell wires well mpls-tp is

547
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:34,019
basically everything static take mpls

548
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,840
and put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all static when mpls was</font>

549
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:39,510
initially designed you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

550
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,850
thought well the days of static routes

551
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,800
in 1980s is over and

552
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,350
we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have nice routing protocol</font>

553
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,330
and so we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put static</font>

554
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:51,969
everything it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into any new protocol</font>

555
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,919
we create and so they didn't you know

556
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,920
you of course you could provision static

557
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,900
LSPs but it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really something that</font>

558
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:05,500
was I you know used outside the lab so

559
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,330
what mpls-tp is basically going back and

560
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,400
put him back all that's needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run a</font>

561
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:12,639
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's completely nms provision</font>

562
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:15,220
central centralized provisioning

563
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,670
everything is static with some OEM that

564
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,800
actually fits a static you know design

565
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,210
because if you have no IP you're not

566
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,480
ping you're going to place out so now

567
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:27,760
you need something different right so

568
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,310
set of wires are the current what they

569
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,770
call the client and IQ terms of mpls-tp

570
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:34,600
that we probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

571
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the future but right now the</font>

572
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,469
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that people are talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

573
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,820
is running a seller<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wairoa mpls-tp</font>

574
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,490
there's really no change subset of ours

575
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,850
you know they they do run over

576
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:50,050
statically configured LSPs and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

577
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:52,780
thanks to to some people in level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

578
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:54,790
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bugged me had to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep</font>

579
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,889
static configuration option in the

580
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:59,500
original doc martini we can start the

581
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:02,710
configure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell wires as well and and</font>

582
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really meant to to do lower</font>

583
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:08,460
costs are ethernet axes and sonnet

584
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:12,360
replacement to replace the solid models

585
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,710
how does it work in one slide well so

586
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,229
mpls-tp is by<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically able</font>

587
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:19,060
configuration every router hub so it's

588
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,640
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the input router it's every hop</font>

589
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,200
along and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will you have to go</font>

590
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,300
configure so basically if you were to

591
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,780
run everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in stock erupting that's</font>

592
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,820
about the same redundancy today is

593
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,950
picking figure by basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pic</font>

594
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:37,120
of figuring a backup path main path back

595
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:41,560
a path using a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean band message will</font>

596
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:44,110
call in a s VI for now that will take

597
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,000
you know tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that one of the links</font>

598
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,580
has failed because it's been detected by

599
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,180
you know link they light failure on the

600
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,879
port or something like that we can also

601
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,070
do the BFD monitoring

602
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,650
which is a vibration for the texture

603
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,080
failure detection monitoring which is

604
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,570
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> we send a packet and look it back</font>

605
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,560
and see when it fails we can trigger a

606
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">switch over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LF you labeled for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

607
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,990
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> its we decided to pick label 13</font>

608
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,880
it's a reserve label that tells when a

609
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:18,150
packet is on that particular less speed

610
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,950
says it is for you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next hop do</font>

611
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,870
not get you should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get forward</font>

612
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,930
anywhere and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is how we do the OM</font>

613
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:28,939
if we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do segment OEM to match</font>

614
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:31,350
the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have in SONET and</font>

615
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,660
otherwise it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a normal I'm Gillis</font>

616
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:40,459
LSP so in theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could put anything</font>

617
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:40,460
through it thank you if any questions

618
00:28:51,590 --> 00:29:00,978
questions

619
00:28:53,779 --> 00:29:03,009
I wouldn't still sleep all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font>

620
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:03,009
you
