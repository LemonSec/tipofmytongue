I'm looking around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and working someplace</font>

18
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:18,020
that d lv is anything like the mob I

assure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it isn't so I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

20
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,990
really talk too much about what d lv is

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most of us know and if you don't</font>

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use these slides for reference</font>

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:29,060
them suffice it to say that what d lv

25
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:31,369
allows you to do is deploy DNS SEC in

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,229
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> absence and do DNS SEC validation on</font>

your cash and resolvers in the absence

00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:39,140
of a sign route and or sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds and</font>

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,908
provides a mechanism for you to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,200
without having to maintain your own

trust anchor repository so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> would we</font>

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,600
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> who wants to deploy this stuff</font>

33
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:52,009
early well I didn't actually learn

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,780
everything I know on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new york city</font>

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,259
weekend and after a very long night out

37
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,060
with friends i was on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subway the</font>

next day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i found myself very close</font>

to one of those subway preachers and to

40
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,100
the extent that i could make out what

actually deploying something that that

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,790
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of useful for folks</font>

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,920
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6 as well</font>

55
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously that's not without some risk</font>

56
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,589
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have been able to remind my</font>

57
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,600
management that part of the role of a

research<font color="#E5E5E5"> university actually is public</font>

59
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,840
service and we should be providing a

60
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,739
sort of test bed environment for

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,260
interesting and new and innovative

62
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:53,450
things especially as they pertain to the

63
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and Berkeley has done that in</font>

64
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,459
the past we had their a very different

65
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,760
role today than we did in the past but

66
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:03,320
it's good for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that</font>

67
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,340
so what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do about a year</font>

68
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago at the time of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kaminski vulnerability when that was</font>

73
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,899
process led to the eventual

74
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,000
implementation in production by the end

75
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,739
of october two thousand eight we were

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,959
doing validation on all eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

resolvers into<font color="#CCCCCC"> any cast clouds think</font>

79
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,359
most of you know what that what that

80
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:41,090
would refer to so that's when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

81
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,680
it and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since then with</font>

82
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:47,269
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two interruptions ah this is</font>

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,030
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite right it's more like</font>

84
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,500
two failures in about<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine or ten months</font>

85
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've actually been paying very</font>

86
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,010
close attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it so a really about</font>

87
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,440
a year because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's when we started</font>

88
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">testing so it's actually been I think</font>

89
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,579
fairly reliable no one expected it or at

90
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">least I didn't expect it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work right</font>

91
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:05,480
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

92
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,388
brand new protocol and a particularly

93
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting way and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can interpret</font>

94
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,519
interesting however you want

95
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,260
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting with</font>

96
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,889
implementing that protocol when it comes

97
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,320
to DNS SEC validation we didn't expect

98
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:21,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">we would do that and that it would just</font>

99
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,780
work and it didn't necessarily just work

100
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,070
but it's actually worked pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well now</font>

101
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to gloss over these failures</font>

102
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,490
because this was a the problems that we

103
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,599
had the glitches I'm going to gloss over

104
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,160
those because this is a lightning talk

105
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,900
they're interesting and there's a lot to

106
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,610
talk about so if we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

107
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,450
it later you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know come up afterward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

108
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:42,080
around after the after we end at noon or

109
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:44,120
at before one but at any rate suffice it

110
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,419
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the impact of some of these</font>

111
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,849
was for example for the first one you

112
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,889
couldn't resolve names in gov for about

113
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:53,000
half a day that's kind of important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

114
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,120
Berkeley because we have Lawrence

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,560
Berkeley National Lab which is a gov and

116
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,880
we have Lawrence Livermore National Lab

117
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,050
and we actually a faculty who are

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">affiliated with those and get their</font>

119
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,910
email at those institutions so that's a

120
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,520
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal for us this turned out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be an</font>

121
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,910
error in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that bind versions</font>

122
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,639
handle certain versions of bind handle d

123
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,499
lv keys that they don't understand they

124
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,860
support instead of treating that as an

125
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:20,780
insecure zone or an insecure situation

126
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,999
they treated as a validation failure

127
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:27,049
which is obviously a significant thing

128
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:31,189
the second issue occurred when the DL

129
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:34,189
vis Sea Org zone was sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss signed</font>

130
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:36,050
the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is C uses to sign it</font>

131
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:38,719
didn't work correctly and I won't go

132
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,810
into huge amounts of details there but

133
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:44,840
the result is that a client<font color="#E5E5E5"> caching</font>

134
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:47,659
resolver with the proper<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust anchor</font>

135
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,810
key for the dl<font color="#CCCCCC"> V zone would have treated</font>

136
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:53,509
any query to that zone any response as a

137
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:56,779
validation failure because you're

138
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:59,090
caching resolver needs to use d lv for

139
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,729
every query it does eventually that

140
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,830

142
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:11,539
very significant at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time the</font>

145
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:20,810
patching work that was done for bind was

146
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,419
not only completed from ICS and very

147
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,460
rapidly but actually got into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number</font>

148
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:27,409
of operating system system distributions

149
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,419
by the end of the week that that

150
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:32,330
particular problem happened with<font color="#CCCCCC"> God and</font>

all the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix it so obviously why</font>

157
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:50,509
did I do this given that there are some

158
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,789
you know obvious issues and there are

159
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:55,339
some obvious controversies what has made

160
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,870
me stick with d lv I put these quotes up

161
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:58,009
here for your reference I actually agree

162
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,990
with a lot of them I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they make</font>

163
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,360
very good points I'm in a sort of gloss

164
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,969
over David's point here and go right on

165
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,680
to one very interesting point that Randy

166
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:09,020
has made a regarding trust how do I

167
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,120
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> dlb to do the right thing with</font>

168
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,289
keys I have to trust it really on two

169
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,120
levels and that's sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what David's</font>

170
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:16,430
point gets to as well I have to trust on

171
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,250
the level of these keys should be the

172
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,899
right keys they should be valid on what

173
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,080
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of vetting process is used to get</font>

174
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:26,089
the keys into the dl b repository and

175
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,789
also how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i trust is you to run their</font>

176
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:28,010

177
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">rectly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because now my infrastructure</font>

in their response to the previous

have come up I don't have a really great

188

answer to the question of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do I know</font>

189
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,760
to trust somebody that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

190
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,260
put the correct keys and they're going

00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put keys that they vetted in there</font>

00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,520
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I you know I have some</font>

194
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,940
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some understanding of how it</font>

195
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,700
works not everyone does and I realize

196
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,350
not everyone's in the same position

197
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,599
topologically with respect to ISC I have

198
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,400
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good you know peering with them</font>

199
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,470
pretty good infrastructure with them so

200
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,900
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of particular things about</font>

201
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,630
my situation that I can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

202
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,890
is see on a variety of levels I realize

203
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,960
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for everyone but it</font>

204
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,820
comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to a personal decision you</font>

205
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,219
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide who to trust you know</font>

206
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,530
anywhere in the internet you know what

207
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:37,020
PGP keys do you trust and who signs them

208
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:39,929
those sorts of things i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this point</font>

209
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,909
is also very interesting regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

210
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,098
fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have made decisions that are</font>

211
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,560
sort of causing my users to be captive

212
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,960
to my decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> i take a great deal of</font>

213
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,579
responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that you know the art</font>

214
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,710
students at Berkeley as<font color="#E5E5E5"> David points out</font>

215
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,350
in this quote are using my name service

216
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,030
they need to rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on me to make the</font>

217
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,730
right decisions that's extremely

218
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,959
important they can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose the art</font>

219
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,800
history students by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way they</font>

220
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually use unbound and the the dance</font>

221
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,329
students are maintaining their own trust

222
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,060
anchor repository and the drama students

223
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:15,210
are actually implementing DNS curve but

224
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:17,369
their drama students so anyway I made

225
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,700
the that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the joke portion of the</font>

226
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,980
talk I made the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision to trust is see</font>

227
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,320
I stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> by that decision and I also take</font>

228
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,060
responsibility for and management even

229
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,550
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of the the current failures</font>

230
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,260
management has been accepting of that if

231
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,640
it continues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there continue to be</font>

232
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,319
bad problems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should say not</font>

233
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,270
continue because these most of these

234
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,040
problems are in the past there haven't

235
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">been any recent problems if there were</font>

236
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,079
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be problems i'm sure i would get some</font>

237
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,670
questions

238
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,650
is to you know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a way you can do</font>

239
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">this that isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite as impactful but</font>

240
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,810
so far things have gone well and so far

241
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm still being supported by management</font>

242
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,329
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just sort of let you</font>

243
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,180
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> this because I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about out of</font>

244
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,010
time I think one way to improve the

245
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,040
kinds of dependency issues that david

246
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,230
conrad identified is to allow zone

247
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,089
transfers or have some mechanism for

248
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,870
hopefully an in-band but even an

249
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:09,060
out-of-band of grabbing of the dl<font color="#CCCCCC"> v zone</font>

250
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,040
or of a dl b repository so you can use

251
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,140
it locally instead of having to query to

252
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,079
someone else's infrastructure for every

253
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,490
query that you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm obviously known</font>

254
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,140
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's aggressive caching</font>

255
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,340
going on but you know essentially you

256
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,720
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on someone else's</font>

257
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,580
infrastructure I think zone transfers

258
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,870
would go a long way or some similar

259
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,400
mechanism and go a long way towards

260
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,900
fixing that there are lots of ways you

261
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on your own with lots of</font>

262
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,590
little scripts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know pull keys</font>

263
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,060
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different places and put them in</font>

264
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,500
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own trust anchor repository but</font>

265
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are also lots of things that can</font>

266
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,490
go wrong with that I think the zone

267
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,980
transfer type of mechanism gives you

268
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,700
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the best bang for the buck in</font>

269
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,590
terms of reliability and that slide is

270
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,060
duplicated obviously what I've learned a

271
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of this stuff I learned by the way</font>

firewalls are pain in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> butt it's not</font>

just 512 byte limits it's also

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,480
fragmentation they need to understand

00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,720
for everyone and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

303
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,019
follow-up make up the points yes we will

304
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:11,730
be making deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> v data available via zone</font>

305
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,939
transfers where we're setting that up

306
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:19,309
now and we're also working with a number

307
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:21,629
of large scale T&S providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

308
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,219
secondary the deal video is you know

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's on reducing one of the single</font>

311
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:29,720
points of failure so you know we're

312
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:35,489
learning to and taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> points on board</font>

315
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:42,149
judges for you if you run across a

316
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:44,819
server how would you like to get the

317
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:46,350
keys to trust is this a really good way

318
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:47,759
to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> other better things we can do</font>

319
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,860
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to advertise our keys at</font>

320
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,629
some point who is not silent if you go

321
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:56,249
directly to let me be very brief about

322
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:58,049
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I feel about that one of the</font>

323
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues or that sort of trade off with me</font>

324
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:01,049
and I'm not probably gonna be able to

325
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,689
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question directly but it's</font>

326
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:05,189
simply a question of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much do I trust</font>

327
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:07,169
myself in terms of being able to

328
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:08,998
maintain my own trust anchor repository

329
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:10,949
and not let geez expire especially if

330
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:12,749
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different keys in some</font>

331
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:15,689
cases I actually would like would rather

332
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:18,480
outsource that process so having someone

333
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:20,459
like ISC do it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually more</font>

334
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,199
trustworthy than having me do it in a

335
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:23,638
certain respect I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I know that</font>

336
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:25,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't answer a question directly but</font>

337
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,410
that that is one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like to see</font>

338
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:29,970
it is going into it either I tar or<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

339
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:33,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">place where is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get it and they</font>

340
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:36,319
can put it in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> dlb thanks very much</font>
