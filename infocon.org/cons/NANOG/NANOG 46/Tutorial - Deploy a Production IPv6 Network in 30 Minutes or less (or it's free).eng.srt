00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,340
30 minutes or less or it's free so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,110
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> work this out in advance with</font>

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,939
audience so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people out</font>

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">there that are running ipv6 networks</font>

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,619
that have been doing it for years that

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,910
of you know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of expertise</font>

14
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,370
out there a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of experience and</font>

15
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,929
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people who are ipv6 is</font>

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,000
outlets people who have really been

17
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,040
pushing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for quite a while and</font>

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
there's also a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,269
haven't been so this talk is

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,360
specifically targeted to people that

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,539
haven't done ipv6 yet for for whatever

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,640
reason so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concerns that</font>

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,250
I've heard our there's people that don't

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,070
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to risk impact to their network by</font>

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,359
turning on v6 there's people that don't

26
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,640
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend money on new hardware to</font>

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,320
do it there's people that have software

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,369
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just haven't adapted to handle</font>

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,600
v6 there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of general interest in</font>

30
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,439
letting other people get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the bugs</font>

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,369
first and then do it themselves there's

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,809
people that say well there's no

33
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,439
commercial driver no one's paying me any

34
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,670
money to do v6 so why do I care there's

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,080
people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to they just</font>

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,869
haven't gotten around to it and there's

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,720
people that just don't like be six or in

38
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,050
other words this talk is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cochin</font>

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,670
everyone point<font color="#CCCCCC"> out Aaron my child</font>

40
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,140
well I bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> that up because there was a</font>

41
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,820
threat of nanog the other day where

42
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,910
cochin said they weren't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do v6</font>

43
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:44,669
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just didn't want to well</font>

44
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,830
well the dusk oceans position and the

45
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,960
point being cogent has all the tools in

46
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,390
place to do it already they just haven't

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,880
done it yet and this is to explain to

48
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:59,790
them how I expect to copy of this on

49
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:04,199

<font color="#CCCCCC">schaeffer's desk by Monday the only</font>

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,880
known alternative to deploy ipv6 so it's

52
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,690
only if it only takes 30 minutes why is

53
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:20,489
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 minute Bob well don't ask me I</font>

54
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:23,370
didn't your schedule<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what I want to</font>

55
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:26,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about here is easy ways to deploy</font>

56
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,840
v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> its particular if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your dual stack</font>

57
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,340
networks I mean there's people out there

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are running tunneled</font>

59
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,680

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">know dedicated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,600 somewhere to do</font>

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,760
their v6 and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cheating</font>

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,829
and doesn't really scale or work anyways

63
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,109
and just creates problems and really

64
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,340
reduces the quality of v6 implementation

65
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,230
to the point where people don't want to

66
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">use v6 because the network sucks so bad</font>

67
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,660
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

68
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,329
dual stack with a native<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 network with</font>

69
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,970
minimal hardware upgrades or hopefully

70
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,989
not at all with minimum management

71
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,359
software changes with the police amount

72
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,470
of pain possible you know to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a make</font>

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,810
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale will make it easy to maintain</font>

74
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,730
and make it not a hassle implement and

75
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:16,079
of course not to break before in the

76
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:19,768
process so quick overview of ipv6 i'll

77
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:22,350
leave the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quote for you to read but</font>

78
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:25,560
honestly v6 isn't that hard I mean

79
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">really what it comes down to ipv4 had</font>

80
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,950
four groups of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 bits separated by a</font>

81
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,230
decimal now you've got eight groups of

82
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:35,160
16 bits by a colon and now it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font>

83
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,280
probably just so you can implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

84
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">dead beef cafe babe jokes it confuses a</font>

85
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,180
lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's not that</font>

86
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult</font>

87
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,180
and also you can encode ipv4 addresses

88
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,450
in ipv6 they just convert to hex and

89
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,879
that comes into play later and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

90
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,010
ease the headaches of a big long looking

91
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,510
number if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a big long string of</font>

92
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,790
zeros you can just replace it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

93
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,069
double colon so you get an address it's

94
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:04,780
not too hideously long and if you can't

95
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:07,950
do hex math<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use a calculator ipv6</font>

96
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,590
really is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like ipv4 with more bits</font>

97
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:14,319
except<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're not supposed to use</font>

98
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,079
the last 64 bits what's been suggested

99
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,048
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that have done the ipv6</font>

100
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">back is that we reserve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 64 bits</font>

101
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:25,599
for host addressing and just use the

102
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,190
first 64 bits for routing so that you

103
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:30,580
get automatic IP addressing plug your

104
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:32,050
computer in it's got an IP already at

105
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,620
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day that may actually not</font>

106
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,030
be a requirement because since ipv6 was

107
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,280
written they came out this thing called

108
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,659
dhcp you might have heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it kind of</font>

109
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,669
solves that problem and for a lot of

110
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,650
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to run dhcp anyways for</font>

111
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,229
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorization whatever</font>

112
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,370
the case may being so the the state

113
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:52,000
lists all the config isn't really

114
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">helping and if you do use this you</font>

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,260
probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font>

116
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,510
router interfaces the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> being it's</font>

117
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,760
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to figure out what the far</font>

118
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,580
side might be numbered and it also makes

119
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:09,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a really long nasty address that is</font>

120
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:11,800
just harder to keep track of so one of

121
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:14,500
the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

122
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,349
v6 rollout was the dual stack addressing

123
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,120
trick really what it comes down to you

124
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:22,090
is for most people the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,710
with rolling out ipv6 is layer a problem

126
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,299
they have to go update their management

127
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,060
software they have to go update their IP

128
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,400
allocation database their dns management

129
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,560
system whatever whatever it may be so

130
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,900
that you know how do you go provision a

131
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,610
whatever block for your customer

132
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,620
interface for your router interface how

133
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,120
do you go set dns it doubles the work

134
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,630
for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it requires a</font>

135
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of software changes so what I wanted</font>

136
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,570
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> was find a way</font>

137
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,280
you didn't have to do that where if you

138
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,909
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing v4 network you could</font>

139
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,919
roll it straight into v6 without with

140
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,450
all that headache and you know have your

141
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">DNS automatically set based on your</font>

142
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:03,500
before have automatic v6 addresses so i

143
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,650
just call it the ipv6 little stack

144
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,020
addressing trick so let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

145
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,380
example that you have this ipv6 blocks

146
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,719
you have this 32 what I chose to do is

147
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">just peel off a 96 to represent the</font>

148
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,280
current ipv4 space you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do it some</font>

149
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:22,280
other way if you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this</font>

150
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,469
happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it the shortest address</font>

151
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,789
and it looks good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trace route so if</font>

152
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:30,470
you just pick the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first you know thing</font>

153
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">there zero-based a carve-out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that 96 and</font>

154
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,330
use that to represent your current<font color="#E5E5E5"> V</font>

155
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,729
Force Base it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just works so when you</font>

156
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,969
convert your your netmask you just add

157
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:44,390
96 to it so where you once had a / 30

158
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,760
you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / 126 and you can</font>

159
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,340
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> just type in the ipv4 address</font>

160
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,710
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end there and it'll take up 32</font>

161
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,330
bits of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> last space and there's a</font>

162
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,039
lot of router code out there that will

163
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,599
just automatically convert this 2x4<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

164
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:02,030
and you'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a nice address and</font>

165
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:03,830
it just works and then it's really easy

166
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,229
to implement you don't have to go

167
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,690
implement additional software to do v6

168
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:11,120
allocations you just you have a v4

169
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,150
address already and then you just type

170
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,210
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 statement so literally you</font>

171
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,739
instantly get v6 deployed on every

172
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,780
router every circuit every<font color="#E5E5E5"> pier every</font>

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,510
customer interface on your network with

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">network it's really easy to copy DNS</font>

175
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,320
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yuri four zones so you don't end up</font>

176
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,330
with there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of networks out there</font>

177
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,460
where you run a big v6 traceroute and it

178
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,690
comes out with no dns because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

179
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,520
don't have the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> or energy to go</font>

180
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,830
maintain that so it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> all solving</font>

181
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,299
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't have to go modify</font>

182
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,640
your customer tools or anything like

183
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,430
that because the v6 dress is already

184
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,840
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt premier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before the</font>

185
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,169
disadvantage obviously is that it

186
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">requires before to do this so it's</font>

187
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:52,490
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> for networks that are dual</font>

188
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,610
stack which is everyone honestly you

189
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,100
just can't do a v6 only network anyways

190
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,020
there's

191
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,360
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing pieces that it doesn't work</font>

192
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,669
so it works if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it before</font>

193
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing network it doesn't accommodate</font>

194
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,540
customer allocations so you probably

195
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">still you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you might use this to</font>

196
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,770
replace<font color="#E5E5E5"> your / 30s or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 ones on your</font>

197
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,540
router's but you're probably still when

198
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:16,080
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that once a 48 give</font>

199
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,850
them real 48 and some older software

200
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,250
requires you to manually translate the

201
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:27,240
hex so juniper basically all known

202
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:29,010
versions that do ipv6 support you just

203
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">enter it in mixed form and it will</font>

204
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,789
actually stay in that form so you type

205
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,010
you know colon colon your before<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

206
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,240
and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay that way and if you</font>

208
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,789

<font color="#E5E5E5">quick conversion you can just ping</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">test with but any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the newer code</font>

222
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,400
you'll have to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversion</font>

223
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,600
yourself and for whatever reason it

224
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:18,120
doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be supported in XR so</font>

225
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,580
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about routing protocol support for</font>

226
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,700
rolling out v6 or network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have two</font>

227
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:28,010
choices ospf or is this don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:30,630
the word grip<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> G seriously let it die</font>

229
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,600
ospf is implemented with an entirely new

230
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,730
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the protocol called ospfv3 it</font>

231
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,680
runs in shipping the night configuration

232
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,420
so you configure your SPF you can figure

233
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,469
yours<font color="#E5E5E5"> p FP three exactly the same way</font>

234
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:46,219
but you duplicate all your

235
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:50,580
configurations is is supports v4 and v6

236
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,960
simultaneously so you may not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

237
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,339
any additional work at all if you run it

238
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,120
is

239
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:58,279
network but you need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a choice</font>

240
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,779
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do v6 as to whether</font>

241
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to run a single or multi</font>

242
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">geology config the advantage in doing a</font>

243
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:07,309
multi topology config is your v6 doesn't

244
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:09,860
have to match your v4 there may be some

245
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:12,050
router links that don't support it there

246
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,790
may be what we've seen is there's

247
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,920
there's still software bugs out there

248
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,480
where v6 forwarding stops working on one

249
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,979
particular interface for some reason and

250
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,779
you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to pull it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

251
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,509
network so if you run multi topology

252
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,069
it's a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just pull v6 on one</font>

253
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,050
particular link until<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can reload the</font>

254
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:29,240
router or recreate the interface

255
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,029
whatever the case may be the

256
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,850
disadvantage is you have to configure

257
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:36,860
metrics for v4 and v6 so you know

258
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,180
everywhere you have is is metric can you

259
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:44,449
know have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go type is is ipv6 metric</font>

260
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,819
10-4 v6 I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bgp pretty much</font>

261
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:48,170
every router out there has a modern<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

262
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:51,290
implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supports multi</font>

263
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:53,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">protocol that means you can have AV for</font>

264
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,149
bgp neighbor the TCP session can be

265
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,579
transported over v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the route itself</font>

266
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,459
can be a v6 address so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one</font>

267
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:02,748
session which carries multiple families

268
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:05,319
the advantage obviously is that it's

269
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:07,610
easier to maintain as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single session</font>

270
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:10,099
the disadvantage is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

271
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:14,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">a liveness test so like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said where</font>

272
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,790
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case where a router breaks v6</font>

273
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,920
forwarding only you may not know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

274
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp session is over before and so</font>

275
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,229
you may black hole whereas if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

276
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,878
have a separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6 s session</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

277
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,670
function<font color="#E5E5E5"> as aliveness test so it'll go</font>

278
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,439
down and stop trying around over it my

279
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,569
personal recommendation is that you do

280
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:35,420
multi-protocol for ibgp and do native

281
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:41,329
for ebgp that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a live miss</font>

282
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:44,199
test for ibgp anyway so some configs for

283
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:46,729
cisco you need to turn it on obviously

284
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:48,258
if you have some platforms where you

285
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,089
have to turn on stuff if you want it to

286
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:53,300
actually forward you know any number of

287
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:55,899
packets without falling over for certain

288
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:00,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">platforms you have to recurve the tcam</font>

292
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:08,640
what happens here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it pulls some space</font>

293

298

303
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:38,220
say you know route that you learn over

304
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,680

00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,670
redistributing all their stuff into

308
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,870
their ospf and then all of a sudden find

309
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:52,110
that they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any enough decamp</font>

310
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,940
for there before four 6575 hundred types

311
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,670
switches you obviously you have to set

312
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,830
some amount of maximum routes for your

313
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,270
for your stuff juniper doesn't really

314
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:05,250
require anything special to get started

315
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just there so really very simple</font>

316
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,070
configuration all you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is add</font>

317
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,750
your your ipv6 address cure interfaces

318
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:15,510
so here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where you can</font>

319
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:18,120
type in the v4 address based on you know

320
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you already have configured and it</font>

321
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,000
converts<font color="#CCCCCC"> the text for you or you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

322
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,810
convert a text and type it in yourself

323
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that way and this example is assuming</font>

324
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:30,209
that you're doing multi topology so you

325
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,240
you turn on this is you do ipv6 routers

326
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,390
is that of IP router is is and you type

327
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:40,410
your your ipv6 metric so<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty simple</font>

328
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:42,030
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> juniper all you need to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is throw</font>

329
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:47,130
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> family inet6 stick in your</font>

330
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:51,180

00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:59,189

334
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,750
ospf<font color="#E5E5E5"> blah the configuration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font>

335
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,280
pretty much the same except<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

336
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,950
few of knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know you had</font>

337
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,770
under ospf v2 that you don't have under

338
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,700
v3 but I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've configured ospf</font>

339
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,699
it's the same thing

340
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:18,719
for juniper<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's same story you just</font>

341
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:23,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">replicate your ospf over to ospfv3 and</font>

342
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,999
it's the exact same config for doing is

343
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:31,199
is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco you create a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

344
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:32,660
family so in this example I figured

345
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,639
multi topology you don't have to do that

346
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,829
you configure a new address<font color="#E5E5E5"> family under</font>

347
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,509
your existing is this config and you you

348
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:42,299
replicate some things like what your

349
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:49,639
reduce your bidding maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths</font>

350
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:54,420
there's duplication of my face but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow</font>

351
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:56,939
but it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much the same thing for</font>

352
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,479
juniper all you have to do is turn on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing and it's there it's</font>

355
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:10,889
uses all the exact same can face very

356
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,470
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> and easy to see that yours is is</font>

357
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:17,730
working now you showing up topology

00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,259
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's now an ipv6 address</font>

361
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:31,079
on there so you know your business is

362
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:33,629
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrying v6 ospf the same as</font>

363
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,910
regular as gift for your ibgp

364
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:38,369
configuration all you have to do is

365
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,110
create a new yearís family this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

366
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:44,639
new syntax for people that have used

367
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:46,199
before only basically you just go create

368
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,579
something and address family v6 and

369
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:50,069
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have eight the new config and</font>

370
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:52,229
it'll turn all your configs into there's

371
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:54,089
now a top<font color="#E5E5E5"> portion that just defines the</font>

372
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,369
session itself and then there's a

373
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,709
address family so anything in your v4

374
00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:00,509
will now separate part of your your

375
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,609
neighbor config down into the v4 address

376
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,290
family and you have to go into the

377
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,419
address family do neighbor whatever

378
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,579
activate and then you apply you know

379
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:10,649
your specific configurations there and

380
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:14,059
it's the exact same with v6 except you

381
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,059
going to address family I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> tv6</font>

387
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,480
really does operate the same way as it

390
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:43,680
it's you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn it on and here's how</font>

391
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:47,880
you verify that it worked you now have

one based on how it's referenced so this

418
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,870
is really handy for doing you know a

419
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,570

know it's based on what protocol is

423
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,280
applying it to for juniper a little more

424
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,520
complex you have to break<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out into</font>

added feature that you're able to

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:18,000
intermix them in the same policy at all

428
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,280
but I went back and tested the oldest

429
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,309
code that I had to test with was 91 and

430
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,168
it's definitely implemented

431
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:27,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're so you just break it out into</font>

432
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:28,509
term ipv4 to ipv6 in some older<font color="#E5E5E5"> codes</font>

433
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:31,059
you actually had to have two separate

434
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:33,879
policies you couldn't intermix a ralphs

435
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:36,639
filter statement at all but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you can</font>

436
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:41,519
do it with separate terms so for the

437
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:41,519
most part you can't go in the same time

438
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:47,710
it seems too easy doesn't it so you're

439
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:49,990
all the fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff where this starts to</font>

440
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,740
break cisco and juniper have different

441
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,909
meanings of next hop self well it's

442
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,429
funny because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually mean the</font>

443
00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:00,610
same thing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have different ways</font>

444
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:02,980
of implementing it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco when you say</font>

445
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:06,189
next stop self and you say Update source

446
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,929
loopback0 if it's a v4 route it'll go

447
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,759
find the v4 address and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ears of beg 0</font>

448
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:11,619
and if it's a v6 route it'll go find the

449
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,559
v6 addressing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look back 0 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

450
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:17,408
just works juniper<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hop self you're</font>

451
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,570
not specifying the interface you're

452
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:22,389
specifying an address so say you have a

453
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:25,600
v4 bgp session with local address<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

454
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:29,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">two three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four and now you have multi</font>

455
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,899
protocol bgp and you set<font color="#E5E5E5"> next top self</font>

456
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,509
when you hit a v6 route it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still going</font>

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:36,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">to want to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the v4 next top the</font>

458
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:38,889
problem being that that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

459
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,529
valid v6 address so what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

460
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:45,219
turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into colon colon your v4</font>

461
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:49,450
address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

462
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:52,600
want and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a design flaw so</font>

463
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:55,179
the best way to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> around this is just</font>

464
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,399
to make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valid address so under</font>

465
00:19:55,179 --> 00:20:00,970
your loopback0 under your family<font color="#CCCCCC"> i 96</font>

466
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:03,039
you go make a secondary basically where

467
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:07,240
you put your before address in this

468
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,590
colon colon before / 128 and now this

469
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be a valid address than anything</font>

470
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,869
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> originate from this router and</font>

471
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:17,580
do next<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> self on will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Valley</font>

472
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:17,580
doesn't solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next top here problem</font>

473
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,649
you'll be valid to you well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

474
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:24,850
basically the issue comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in ibgp</font>

475
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:26,590
when you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> jumper router that</font>

476
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,889
originates the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route it's going to set</font>

477
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,060
its next hop to

478
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,920
itself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you want it to be valid</font>

479
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,909
within your network when you cross

480
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,370
boundaries obviously when you do next

481
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:41,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">top self on a yeah it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to it's</font>

482
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,500
going to break if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do multi topology</font>

483
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,750
ebgp which is another reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to do</font>

484
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,280
that basically because you're setting

485
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,860
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop self based on your before</font>

486
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:57,750
address and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be going</font>

487
00:20:49,860 --> 00:21:00,479
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be supported exactly so you don't</font>

488
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:06,570
have to do next top self on your ebgp

489
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:09,510
that's implied so it turns out there's

490
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:12,149
not a lot of support for ipv6 and mpls

491
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,950
shortcuts or to quit<font color="#E5E5E5"> VJ kill the traffic</font>

492
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,600
engineer first you need traffic which is

493
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,530
why it hasn't been a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> for p6 so</font>

494
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:23,550
far but it turns out that iOS doesn't

495
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:27,990
actually have a way to do ipv6 into mpls

496
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:30,899
as a next hop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Juno s didn't add it</font>

497
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:35,070
until 93 but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 93 you can now turn</font>

498
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:38,400
on ipv6 shortcuts so you can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

499
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,659
your ipv6 traffic into mpls and expect

500
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,610
your network to work the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

501
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,900
would if you don't it's just routed

502
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,149
natively it just doesn't go into mpls

503
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,360
and you know that may or<font color="#CCCCCC"> may not be a</font>

504
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,680
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your capacity if you're</font>

505
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,120
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic engineering but you</font>

506
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,680
probably don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough v6 traffic to</font>

507
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,110
matter anyways ipv6 packet filtering so

508
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that are experienced with ipv4</font>

509
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:04,500
know that you use art to resolve an IP

510
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,629
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a mac</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and v6 you now use ICMP</font>

511
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,280
neighbor discovery so this turns out to

512
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,680
be a real kick in the teeth for people

513
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,780
who just<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter all ICMP and then expect</font>

514
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,640
things to work and this has happened

kicking the teeth<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people who rate</font>

00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,730
and there's also an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

where<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco actually tries to work</font>

535
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,809
there's a bunch of other issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> older</font>

just though the older<font color="#E5E5E5"> asics aren't</font>

doing hashing so when you start passing

543

a lot of traffic you may find that all

544
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,940
of a sudden it's going to end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one</font>

546
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,419
eventually when you start doing ipv6

547
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,750
traffic which may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for quite a</font>

while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also the size of the v6 packet</font>

549
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,490
besides the v6 address can consume a lot

550
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,610
more routing resources so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example on</font>

551
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:47,340
the cisco soup 720 you have basically

552
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:50,340
144 bit tkm entry there isn't enough

553

other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can match on so</font>

557
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:02,908
what happens is when you use an address

558
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,760
that's longer than a / 88 it turns off

559
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:08,760
your ability to do later for acls for

560
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,799
that route so that's something to

561
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:16,860
consider if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do ACLs in the cisco</font>

a perfect protocol there's still issues

564
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:26,309
that occur there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of situations</font>

575
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:49,770
we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a problem with seeing</font>

for other reasons and work around<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

major gotchas that I've seen people have

problems with and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you eliminate</font>

your routing protocol and there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:50,600
and that's it questions

600
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:15,090
how do you or can you can what I'm

601
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:18,120
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> router to router</font>

603
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,770
globally unique IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> spaces so you have</font>

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,560
they've always expected it to you could

607
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,900
use link local if you wanted to keep

608
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,030
that isolated and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a good</font>

609
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:36,960
alternative to using 1918 space that a

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're traceroute doesn't work so using</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">isolated is a good option what</font>

00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,239
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously that would apply only if</font>

621
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,239
you're doing next hop self off your

00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:11,779
router if you're if you're not doing

623
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:13,609
that you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to carry your next</font>

624
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:17,149
hop in your ITP which means you wouldn't

625
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:20,239
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the kögel yes hey Richard</font>

626
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:21,830
thank you you have 30 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> freak can</font>

627
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:25,849
you show us real real time how to do it

628
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:28,129
no no<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay add a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you mentioned</font>

629
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:32,269
you ran into<font color="#E5E5E5"> something with the soup 720</font>

630
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:34,369
with tkm space for layer for acls and

631
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:37,009
128-bit addresses can you explain that

632
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:39,320
in depth I mean basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just the</font>

633
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:40,999
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> of address space there's limited</font>

634
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,908
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hardware resources for a</font>

635
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:47,379
firewall look up and you can't do a

636
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:49,639
firewall match to the full 128 bits and

637
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:53,719
specify<font color="#CCCCCC"> a layer for port at the same</font>

638
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:55,549
time so if you're using a<font color="#CCCCCC"> address that's</font>

639
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,440
longer than / 88 you know the router

640
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:59,359
will throw a log and it'll say has gone

641
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,599
into compact mode and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll tell you</font>

642
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on an ACL that way I</font>

643
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:06,499
think if you can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just goes to</font>

644
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,799
the CPU<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a cpu</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> punt so you don't get</font>

645
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:11,869
hardware filtering but it'll it'll warn

646
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:15,049
you if you do that so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean if you</font>

647
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:16,249
configure an ACL that specifies a target

648
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:19,580
a source destination target<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

649
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:21,229
longer than / 88 so what happens is if

650
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,869
you can figure anything that's longer

651
00:28:21,229 --> 00:28:25,369
than a / 88 so this is an option i

652
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,320
forgot to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one</font>

653
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:31,220
reason you might not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a slash</font>

654
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,960
96 for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your roof or to v6 space is</font>

655
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,409
obviously you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to exceed that so</font>

656
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,549
you could you know pull out a 48 or a 64

657
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:41,450
or whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case may be in your</font>

658
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:44,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">network you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and use that there's no</font>

659
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:46,279
reason that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be all the way</font>

660
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:50,919
to the end it just makes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nicer</font>

661
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:50,919
 address good thanks

662
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,300
so it does get filtered but he gets

663
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,810
punted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU so on the telnet to the</font>

664
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:10,090
router anyways that's going to happen

665
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,830
but it isn't an issue for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me because I</font>

666
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:15,550
do filtering on them juniper side

667
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:17,919
anyways but it is a concern if you want

668
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:20,080
to do for full you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you want to be</font>

669
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,170
able to specify out that long but you

670
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,879
can you can look up ipv6 if there was it

671
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:26,530
throws an error message when you do it

672
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,150
is compact with something or another so

673
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:32,970
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look that up and see all the</font>

674
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">pacific rules but that's what I saw</font>

675
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:51,300
other questions yes well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

676
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">much the same as ipv4 if you filter your</font>

677
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:58,090
your path MTU discovery you're going to

678
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:59,800
have a problem so obviously you don't

679
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,300
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to filter all ICP but there's</font>

680
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,190
there's people that don't understand

681
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,260
that you need to make an explicit allow

682
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,770
for neighbor discovery so if you copy

683
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:11,050
your existing before ICP filters over to

684
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:14,200
v6 you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all neighbor</font>

685
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:15,550
discovery things like pack it too big

686
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,130
that they change the name around<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

687
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,450
few things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you'll be poking around to</font>

688
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:23,170
see a lot of changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name anyways</font>

689
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:25,300
but things like packet too big you still

690
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,340
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to allow otherwise you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

691
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,480
break path MTU discovery and you're

692
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do this off some people</font>

693
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:36,260
somewhere they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use jumbo</font>

694
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:45,320
frames any else

695
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:46,640
I guess not<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I don't know off the top</font>

696
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,419
of my head<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I know they raised it</font>

697
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,180
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,200 something they used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:59,150
576 minimum packet size<font color="#E5E5E5"> for v4 now it's</font>

699
00:30:53,180 --> 00:31:01,580
been raised<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so make sure your</font>

700
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,500
network supports that which for the most

701
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,889
part everyone's network is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,500 based</font>

702
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,890
anyway so

703
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:29,349
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that the question was if</font>

704
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:32,919
he's he's turned out v6 peers for people

705
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:36,700
he's had to shut in no shut appear to

706
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it to come up I would expect to see</font>

707
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,840
some period of time worth doing the

708
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:43,539
neighbor discovery but we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

709
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,658
into that issue I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the most part</font>

710
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:47,979
it's you you implement the neighbor<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

711
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:49,749
exact same way as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do with before</font>

712
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:51,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">except you do address-family ipv6</font>

713
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:56,919
instead of before and you use on a dress

714
00:31:51,909 --> 00:32:02,279
that has some<font color="#CCCCCC"> poland's in it yep that's</font>

715
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:02,279
that's how we've seen it anybody else

716
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:13,269
next time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've mentioned it to a bunch</font>

717
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:16,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people a bunch of times and they go</font>

718
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:18,460
we have what you're going to do so maybe

719
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:20,499
if you're a bigger customer with some

720
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,289
weight to sling around you might want to

721
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:28,239
complain about that apparently not what

722
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:31,919
you in for but yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> no information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

723
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:36,570
any plans to fix that<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time soon</font>

724
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,570
anybody else yes

725
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:43,370
and as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I'm concerned I make the</font>

726
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,710
network pass the packets and what

727
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,479
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that ipv6 is still broken</font>

728
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:51,410
enough that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably someone</font>

729
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,940
else's issue but you know at this point

730
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,370
there's a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there who</font>

731
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,900
really do have v6 requirements where

732
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,699
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to buy service from</font>

733
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,980
you if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't support v6 even if they</font>

734
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,680
don't support v6 yourself so my answer

735
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,240
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market driver is you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>
