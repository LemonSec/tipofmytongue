for talk about some areas of work that

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,849
might be needed some resources we'll

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,230
talk a little bit about how how folks

of understanding at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time but really</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not is it's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

52

protocol we use it very similarly but it

53
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:38,040
is in fact a separate distinct protocol

54
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:40,620
and we should look at it such so another

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,299
is we have another mode of operation we

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,350
call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stateless DSP v6 which</font>

58
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:50,370
generally speaking is something that we

59
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,569
don't we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in v4 land and this</font>

60
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,780
basically it's something that gets

61
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,040
coupled with with something like auto

62
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,440
configuration or static address

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,109
assignment where you have an address

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,640
through some other mechanism like static

65
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,049
assignment or auto configuration but you

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,268
still need configuration information<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

67
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:11,190
v6 address alone this is simply not

68
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:13,920
enough to be functional on on a v6

69

like your dns server ipv6 addresses

72
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,489
something that would be to prove to be

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,030
quite useful if you ever want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> surf</font>

as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned earlier it is simply not</font>

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:45,569
and again kind of kind of kind of nag

80
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,650
you about this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we in in v6 land</font>

81
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,920
we listen on port 546 for clients and

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:54,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers and relays this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> port 547</font>

83
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,048
unlike before we are we are solely a

layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 protocol we kind of highlight</font>

85
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:05,069
here the link local multicast addresses

86
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,069
that these vb 6 clients servers and

87
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,290
relays will communicate on so again you

88
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,380
know we you know as a layer 3 protocol

89
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,730
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very strong dependency on all</font>

96
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,130
or you can simply afford them along the

and challenges there but certainly

105
00:04:52,190 --> 00:05:00,380
something that is a viable if you wish

106
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:04,160
to do so we do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the notion of relay</font>

these pv6 messages we do employ a larger

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:47,810
option code space and you know while

122
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,270
there are some similarities with before

123
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are encoded using a different</font>

130
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,450
that sort of thing v6 is a bit more

131
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,620
cleaner from that point of view a lot

132
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,680
more cleaner for that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view a</font>

pardon my lapse of English so here on

135
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:30,530
this slide we do a comparison of v6 to

136
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:32,510
v4 messages as you'll see there are four

137
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,320
remaining the messages there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very</font>

138
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,469
much parallels that you can pull from

139
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,280
the v4 state

140
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,070
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are some things that are</font>

141
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">just they're absent right so for example</font>

142
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:49,780
we we don't explicitly have the notion

145
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,520
kind of go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point we talked</font>

146
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,190
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> nested real agent information and</font>

147
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,349
how we transmit and relay packets from a

148
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,560
server to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network from a client</font>

149
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,750
through the network to a server a kind

150
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,850
of onboard you with a rundown of all

151
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,680
these but for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who are</font>

152
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,419
familiar with these before you'll you'll

153
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,320
be able to to establish some

154
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:26,049
relationships as to you know to from<font color="#CCCCCC"> v40</font>

155
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:30,010
v6 so the role of routers in a v6

156
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:32,260
network so today when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> enable v6 on</font>

157
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,949
your on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop's essentially you</font>

158
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:39,460
you choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you choose to enable DVD</font>

159
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:43,810
to be before or<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a static address or</font>

160
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,270
or whatever in<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6 some of the core</font>

161
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,060
specifications call for router

162
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,609
advertisements to transmit information

163
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,360
on the local link that generally

164
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,760
instruct dhcpv6 capable clients what to

165
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,310
do right so particularly what we're

166
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,169
talking about here in you know on this

167
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:07,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide here are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rtm in the obits</font>

168
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:09,159
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess in theory and in some</font>

169
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,530
cases practiced the the m-bit is

170
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,680
designed to or into was intended to

171
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:17,500
trigger staple dhcpv6 messaging whereas

172
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:22,330
the obit was or is intended to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

173
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:24,490
of trigger stateless DS pv6 messaging we

174
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,440
see this in a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of operating</font>

175
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">systems and I can tell you that um to</font>

176
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,650
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead a little bit from a</font>

177
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:31,630
docsis point of view we actually

178
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:35,228
leverage and kind of employ this

179
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:38,169
behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows vista will also behave</font>

180
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:41,200
this way as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well max do not support HP</font>

181
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:43,390
v6 and nor does XP for it or whatever

182
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's worth about natively i should say i</font>

183
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,530
mean you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably put diddler or</font>

184
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:48,560
something else like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on there but</font>

185
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,689
but

186
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:56,349
vista comes with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft DCP client</font>

187
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,350
v6 client that seems to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly well</font>

188
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,630
so we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into any more</font>

189
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,730
of the behavior of<font color="#E5E5E5"> router's here that's</font>

190
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,439
probably a whole nother tutorial and a

191
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,870
whole nother hour and a half or an

192
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,540
hour's worth of time that we can we can

193
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,360
look at for another day so with that

194
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,900
we'll we'll keep will keep chugging

195
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,210
along here as far as your v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> is relates</font>

196
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,120
to some of the router behavior so just

197
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:28,070
through there is some I kind of recap

198
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,810
here at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Meo bit I'll kind of omit</font>

199
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,610
some of the information about prefix

200
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:36,439
information options that are transmitted

201
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:38,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">down the way one thing to note is if you</font>

202
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,060
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your if you send prefix information</font>

203
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,949
options down from your from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

204
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,040
northbound router and you have an a bit

205
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,050
set and your obit set to one as well

206
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,089
that's the scenario that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about</font>

207
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,089
earlier where stateless<font color="#E5E5E5"> TTP six would be</font>

208
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:55,070
employed for to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> the node get the</font>

209
00:09:53,089 --> 00:10:00,080
remainder of its of his figuration

210
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:01,339
information so in that scenario as well

211
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,380
if you were to statically assigned your

212
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:05,510
note and address and it received an obit

213
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,120
and you had a properly behaving DC v6

214
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,710
client or an IP node it would do a very

215
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,980
similar thing or it should do a very

216
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:18,380
similar thing so so now kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> off of</font>

217
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,230
the router space kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really want</font>

218
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to kind of get tied up in in in all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

219
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,089
business I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay focus on these</font>

220
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">vb 6 you'll find here we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

221
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:30,980
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the protocol particulars for</font>

222
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:34,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">these abusive so in in v6 we use the</font>

223
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,820
notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a DUI d a DSP unique</font>

224
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,430
identifier and it was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of funny i</font>

225
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">think on an an augmenting list not too</font>

226
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,229
long ago there was actually a debate or

227
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,279
a thread about this topic in particular

228
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,260
because duid is not the hardware address

229
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,839
of the interface where the transit work

230
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,330
of the client had sent a message uid

231
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,800
basically takes one of the three formats

232
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,380
that you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> below which are</font>

233
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,089
specified as part of 32 15 which some

234
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,569
you

235
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:06,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware address as its basis but</font>

236
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:07,930
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are there are derivation to it and</font>

237
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,220
there are a lot of folks out there who

238
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:14,138
use mac address as an access control

239
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,470
mechanism in our networks whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

240
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:20,559
knack of some form of a network access

241
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,360
control service or even in cable

242
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,269
environment where<font color="#CCCCCC"> where mech addresses</font>

243
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:30,339
are used to associate attributes and

244
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:31,839
places of service to to subscribers you

245
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,970
know folks on the mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> list were like</font>

246
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,529
well what am I going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now you know</font>

247
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,170
I I'm kind of missing some information

248
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,120
that I need we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will revisit this</font>

249
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,469
later on in the in the tutorial when we

250
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked a bit about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis to talk about</font>

251
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">how how we in cable industry had had</font>

252
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:52,269
kind of addressed this and and specified

253
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,059
what we needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of you know to</font>

254
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:58,509
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of support our deployment and you</font>

255
00:11:55,059 --> 00:12:00,699
know run our business there are two that

256
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,959
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> linked layer based one is strictly</font>

257
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,790
link layer based the other one is link

258
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,160
layer plus time and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

259
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,559
one that is uh that is vendor signed

260
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,769
which is essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> not based on</font>

261
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:17,410
anything physical pertaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

262
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:19,120
place so to elaborate we have we have

263
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,009
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of dig into some of</font>

264
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:27,639
the modes of operation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> DSP v6 here</font>

265
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:29,110
so the most probably relatable mode of

266
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,110
operation to everybody in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room is</font>

267
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,850
stapled ESP v6 and essentially this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

268
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,949
the mode of operation v6 that is very

269
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,499
similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we use today and we use</font>

270
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:40,628
this it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> foremost exchange solicited</font>

271
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:41,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">advertise request reply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we use this</font>

272
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:44,649
to obtain not only IP address

273
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:47,860
information but prefix prefixes as well

274
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:50,139
in in some cases as well as

275
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,889
configuration information there is a

276
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:56,829
mode of operation is stapled HP v6 that

277
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:59,889
again is different than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in v4 it's</font>

278
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:01,779
called a rapid commit and traditionally

279
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:03,790
we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> four message exchange solicit</font>

280
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:05,589
advertise for crush supply which is

281
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,429
analogous to discover offer request an

282
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:12,670
act and before in in rapid commit mode

283
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:13,400
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a stateful exchange allowing for</font>

284
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,170
that you know

285
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,310
the transmission<font color="#CCCCCC"> of both address</font>

286
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,800
information and configuration

287
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,719
information the only difference being is

288
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,609
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only two messages so it's a</font>

289
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,040
lighter-weight exchange now there are

292
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,110
of which kind of caused us to not look

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it consider this for use as far as</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Doc's influence our concern in our case</font>

295
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,250
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dhb servers that</font>

296
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,660
receive that request they will both

297
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,940
reply assuming that they are

298
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,620
authoritative authoritative<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee offering</font>

299
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> address to the client so now you</font>

300
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,080
have two needs to be serviced in a

301
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,070
network thinking that they've just

302
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:56,090
assigned an address to the same client

303
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:57,590
so maybe in your network that's some

304
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:01,700
that works that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a problem but but</font>

305
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:03,740
in certain networks having a common

306
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,140
understanding of who authoritative<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee</font>

307
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,570
issued the the binding of the lease is

308
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:14,990
very important particularly if conflicts

309
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:18,620
arise at some point so again as part of

310
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:22,010
stable DS vb6 we transmit configuration

311
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:25,070
information some of which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

312
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,080
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here at the top of the slide 36 46</font>

313
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:31,520
which is basically dns server ipv6

314
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,110
address information and it you know

315
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,050
obviously it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandatory the one</font>

316
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,660
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take note about as far as TTP</font>

317
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,270
v6 is concerned and this is a more

318
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,000
lesson observation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it was</font>

319
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,970
it's not it's not inadvertent is DC

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,740
servers and clients will rigidly adhere

321
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:52,820
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> option request option unlike some</font>

322
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,250
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen over the years in</font>

323
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,740
v4 land so if if a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP server is</font>

324
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,800
configured to transmit more options back

325
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,510
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> ass than a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client requests the the</font>

326
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,520
extraneous options won't won't be

327
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">transmitted back the fundamental</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> premise</font>

328
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,360
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you're going to ask me for</font>

329
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,860
exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

330
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,490
only give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you back what you want nothing</font>

331
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,930
more right so that's kind of important

332
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,760
because we've had people ask well if I

333
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:21,560
can figure it why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

334
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:23,630
why doesn't serve<font color="#E5E5E5"> a descendant well it's</font>

335
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,630
that's a difference and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

336
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,040
to be mindful of particularly on a

337
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,300
client implantation side because you

338
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,980
have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that if you are</font>

339
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,390
expecting options to be sent down to

340
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,600
clients that you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that those</font>

341
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:39,170
clients are asking for them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

342
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,960
just kind of a reminder typically staple

343
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">these bb6 is is triggered when the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> M or</font>

344
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,190
the management in the router

345
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:48,980
advertisements<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the one obviously you</font>

346
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,120
could manually initiate the HP v6 on the

347
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,040
command line which is happens on most

348
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux platforms whether it's you know I</font>

349
00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:01,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">cs.ds pv6 client or even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> diggler on</font>

350
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:05,959
Windows what happened so here kind of a

351
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:08,410
very simple graphical illustration of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

352
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:13,089
DCP exchange on a flat on a flat network

353
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:16,520
again very similar to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ESP before now</font>

354
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:20,510
that's interesting so the nanog folks

355
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:26,410
had asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to essentially hide the all</font>

356
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:28,640
this packet detail largely to kind of

357
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,530
prevent us from having to go look

358
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,020
through and do the eye chart thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

359
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,630
live during the tutorial apparently when

360
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:39,110
we convert it to PDF that didn't work

361
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,460
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> too well so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to not go</font>

362
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,600
through all those packets races in

363
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,160
detail unless there's something I want

364
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:49,100
to call out to your attention that's

365
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:53,000
different in in v6 land so here in this

366
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:57,230
case you'll notice that this DT v6

367
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,620
transaction uses a DUI d and you'll see

368
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:04,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dy D with the link layer plus</font>

369
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:07,490
time format and just as an aside if

370
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,709
anybody wants the actual sniffer traces

371
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,689
for these four so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can look at</font>

372
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,220
them and take a closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> look I think I</font>

373
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">have my email address at the back feel</font>

374
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,420
free to drop you know and I'm happy to

375
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,948
share those<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you because I know look</font>

376
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:23,360
at them like this text format might not

377
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,800
be the most usable format and you'll see

378
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,448
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we have an option request option</font>

379
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,360
here and again we're explicitly

380
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:31,880
requesting the the name to recursive

381
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,280
name server list and Adam

382
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,540
search list so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this appear of course is</font>

383
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,370
the solicit which is originating from

384
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,960
the client then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been advertised</font>

385
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,969
which is a response back from the server

386
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really not going to bore you</font>

387
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,290
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google kateri one of these so I'll</font>

388
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,710
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cruise through most of them and</font>

389
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:52,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">then we have request and then reply now</font>

390
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,140
as we as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned earlier there is a</font>

391
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,600
mode of operation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> state ball nature</font>

392
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,870
called rapid commit but it's a kind of a

393
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,490
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an abbreviated exchange you'll</font>

394
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:05,959
see that this essentially is solicit and

395
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:07,310
reply and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is stateful so we are</font>

396
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,270
exchanging addressing configuration

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:16,340
information here as part of this

398
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:19,400
exchange and you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that you'll</font>

399
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:23,270
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the top the second column the</font>

400
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,610

401
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,550
rep and commit important point to note

402
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,639
here about about rapid commit a client

403
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,899
can advertise its capability but it's

404
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">really up to the server whether or not</font>

405
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,380
he wishes to honor that so if server

406
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,330
basically says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm cool we'll grab</font>

407
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,460
the committee I'm just going to reply

408
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,770
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a reply you know we're done</font>

409
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,480
however if a<font color="#E5E5E5"> deist be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> server-side said</font>

410
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna support rep commit he can</font>

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,150
simply reply back<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an advertised and</font>

412
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,710
that will for compliant DSP clients that

413
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:55,870
should trigger them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete the</font>

stateful for message exchange for HPV 6

415
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:04,430
so kind of an extension to staple these

447
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:26,720
we have we have kind of the details of

448
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,330
the packets here you'll notice that kind

<font color="#E5E5E5">of halfway down the first column here on</font>

00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">subtle but it's very important thing to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know if you see enough of these</font>

457
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:54,770
chained together it'll be kind of

458
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:56,450
eye-popping because I'm extent so I'll

459
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:00,020
kind of flip through the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:05,080

462
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,940
of these bb6 in a real environment

463
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,830

466
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:20,679
so switching gears a bit too stateless

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:23,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">sees bb6 we we mentioned earlier that</font>

468
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,720
the implication here is that you have a

469
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,189
node that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten its ipv6 address</font>

470
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,690
generally only its address from some

471
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,660
other source or the static assignment or

472
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,880
odd configuration and in this case this

473
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,490
daily seats bb6 exchange is essentially

474
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,360
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 message reply information request</font>

475
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,490
and a reply which will supply the client

476
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,840
with the configuration information it

477
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:49,790
requested in its orl and this mode of

478
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,918
behavior generally is triggered when the

479
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:55,480
obit and the

480
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:59,109
advertisement is set to<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and we have</font>

481
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,080
a graphical representation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of of the</font>

482
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:05,799
stateless message exchange assuming kind

483
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,649
of somewhat of a flat<font color="#CCCCCC"> network noticeably</font>

484
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:11,619
smaller message<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not asking for</font>

485
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:16,570
as much and there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> two message</font>

486
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:17,619
exchange so a little bit about prefix

487
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,230
delegation I probably should have

488
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:23,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">brought this up probably movies up more</font>

489
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:28,480
behind more so behind the the stateful

490
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:31,210
DSP v6 section again as part of a staple

491
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,159
exchange a client can ask for not only a

492
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:37,799
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of essentially a unicast address</font>

493
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:40,299
but also asked for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ni a pd or prefix</font>

494
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,369
and they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done as part of the same</font>

495
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:45,100
message generally done as part of the

496
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:47,830
same message so this isn't implying that

497
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,539
that you're forced to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple</font>

498
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,210
message exchanges to get first the

499
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:55,269
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the prefix you can you</font>

500
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:59,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you can do this in practice with 11</font>

501
00:22:55,269 --> 00:23:02,200
message and again it's one or more ad

502
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,739
prefixes which could be coupled with one

503
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,509
or more prefixes as well which again is

504
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:09,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a somewhat of a different constructs</font>

505
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:14,169
or behavior than what we've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

507
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:21,730
the message flow here kind of not going

508
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:22,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">to bore you with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pretty graphic what</font>

509
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,600
you're going to see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this slide</font>

510
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:28,418
here is again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nested relay message</font>

511
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,908
for the nested a dc-6 relay message and

512
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:34,690
then off to the second column you'll

513
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:36,249
notice that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ia the identity</font>

514

<font color="#CCCCCC">Association for previous delegation</font>

515
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:43,779
ultimately this will be used to trigger

516
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:46,320
the previous delegation for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

a client and the server

518
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:54,100
and then we'll just follow the message

519
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:56,020
flow through like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier same</font>

527
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:26,980
we've allocated a / 56 of that of that

00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:35,800
with that prefix information to this

529
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:38,560

530

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 we have the ability to transmit</font>

539

you'll reply back to and ultimately the

we'll show you how these are these are

leveraged DCP v6 preference dc-6 server

599
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:08,300
preference is essentially something that

600
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,610
a DSP p6 server will transmit as part of

601
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,120
its advertised back to a client and it's

602
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:15,129
an indicator of exactly that

603
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,020
reference relative<font color="#E5E5E5"> to other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advertisers</font>

604

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a client may may see and</font>

605
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:28,330
essentially the 33 15 specifies the

606
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:30,280
semantics behind behind the option if

607
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:33,370
there's no preference it's an indicator

608
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,559
that the purpose is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 a purpose of 255</font>

00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,530
is essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most preferred it is</font>

610
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,910
the highest preference and anything

611
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,680
preference less than 255 there is

612
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:45,100
explicit behavior while there's

613
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,870
specified behavior their clients must

614
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,530
adhere to as far as waiting for

615
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:52,209
additional responses the good thing is

616
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,250
it's not like it's not like the waiting

617
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,540
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the specified timers are an</font>

00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,309
eternity right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would that</font>

619
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,770
would kind of be problematic<font color="#CCCCCC"> from uh</font>

620
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:02,590
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a deployment point of view but but</font>

621
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:05,050
but I can assure you that that this

622
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:08,678
notion of preference is functional and

623
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:13,770
it actually has it actually has utility

624
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:16,000
in in in a real in a real deployment so

625
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,889
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> continued in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notion of</font>

626
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,990
things that that we've you know that

we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of looked at as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far as v6</font>

630
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:36,220
notion of reconfigure some of you may

631
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:39,639
may kind of equate this to force renew

632
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,250
in before land I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of say that this</font>

633
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,650
is I kind of call this the the right way

634
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,620
to do what we originally had tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

635
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:49,990
in before and this essentially the

636
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:53,020
reconfigure behavior is the ability of a

637
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:56,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">DSP server to essentially remotely</font>

affect a client and<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect it in a way</font>

639
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,080
where you're basically sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> at every</font>

640
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,110
configure message and providing that

the and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's past you</font>

645
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:12,480
essentially can affect a client and tell

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,399
it to you know you know renew or revine

647
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,970
and in some parts of some environments

648
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:21,310
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> desirable behavior right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

649
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:23,770
you know once once you kind of send some

leasing information to a client you you

651

kind of tolerance is for that in your

657

deployment how you use dhcpv6 something

658
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:44,210
like reconfigure it could come in

659
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:51,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">awfully handy just a side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> note about</font>

660
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:52,610
this reconfigure in particular in my

661
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,679
mind represents the opportunity for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

662
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,899
to leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> octave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u6 most of time when</font>

663
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">people talk about v6 they say well you</font>

664
00:30:56,899 --> 00:31:00,379
know so why should I could I'd p6 now

665
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,610
you know how am I going to has going to

666
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,470
bed for me how am i gonna make money and

667
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,850
most of time you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of knee deep and all this I well</font>

00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:09,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know you're going to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

672
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:15,679
of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas technologically that</font>

673
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,350
offers us so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good opportunity</font>

674
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:22,250
right so imagine if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will if you can</font>

675
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:24,740
take a lease for these PB 6 client and

676
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:27,020
extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for a long period of time</font>

677

longer than normal than what you

678
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,520
normally might and now you have a lot

679
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,710
less activity a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot less churn lot less</font>

to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network you know packets that</font>

682
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:40,700
you'd normally would have kind of

683
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,740
essentially created on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network so</font>

684
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,090
that you had constant connect a constant

686
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,770
physics fine but now imagine you know in

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,330
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network you got lots of nodes and</font>

688
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,539
kind of give all these nodes and

689
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,039
extended and extended extended lease and

690
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:56,360
you no longer fear that you'll be able

691
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">to kind of get back in contact with them</font>

692
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,189

719
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:13,099
many of them leverage leverage vendor

720
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:14,989
information options quite a bit from a

721
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:16,970
minimalist point of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> to very extreme</font>

722
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:19,340
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis is one of those that we'll</font>

723
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,200
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shortly where i'll show you</font>

724
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,259
how we've how we've kind of leveraged

725
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,259
those vendor information options to for

726
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:29,960
the benefit of our deployment and we've

727
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:33,259
kind of use them the way to kind of make

728
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rtv6 clients are sending</font>

729
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:37,789
and able to receive kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

730
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:39,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need to to provision them in v6</font>

731
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:41,720
mode and operate those devices

732
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:45,649
essentially vendor information options

733
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,320
as part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 13-15 give us the give us the</font>

734
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:51,459
option space within within the core

735
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,889
protocol where we can actually specify

736
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,960
under our own under a unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enterprise</font>

737
00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:59,330
ID options that are specific to that

738
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">Enterprise I do I won't kind of</font>

739
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,139
elaborate too much on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

740
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:05,809
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of create some discontinuity around</font>

741
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:07,939
what we're going to talk about later but

742
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:09,889
again providing flexibility right so

743
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,770
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about essentially vendor</font>

744
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,029
options you know kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ability to</font>

745
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:18,379
leverage vendor options as part of the

746
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:19,639
core protocol definitely it definitely

747
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:21,679
had some flexibility but at the same

748
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:26,270
time from from a primer<font color="#E5E5E5"> purist point of</font>

749
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,950
view represents the opportunity to kind

750
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:32,690
of get a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> overzealous depending on</font>

751
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:35,058
depending on how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it yeah so</font>

752
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,190
I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the misuse right so and</font>

753
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:39,619
again what we've done not to kind of

754
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,089
talk too much about before but very

755
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:45,909
similar constructs have been specified

756
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:45,909
and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> added 2 g's B before as well</font>

757
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:54,630
ok so these be four<font color="#E5E5E5"> and b6 coexistence</font>

758
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:57,150
so you know what kind of at a place now

759
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:59,430
where I were on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same page before v</font>

760
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:03,270
six different protocols different ports

761
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:05,370
you know you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they going to you</font>

762
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,780
know how do we how do we kind of live<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

763
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,750
a world where there are coexisting to

764
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:12,210
another right i mean you know if

765
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,410
anybody's seen the actually this

766
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,740
dismantle network is a perfect example

767
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:19,109
right we are today in an environment

768
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:22,109
where we have v4 and v6 coexisting with

769
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:24,240
exception of people who are running you

770
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">know well actually I put this</font>

771
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,060
differently people who are running

772
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">windows are actually living in an</font>

773
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,330
environment where this is the case right

774
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,010
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it thought my mistaken stateful</font>

775
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:37,440
deep-sea v6 should be functional on this

776
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,240
network so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are coexistence</font>

777
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,260
considerations and there's I believe

778
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,180
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeds out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there that kind of</font>

779
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,210
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this when you when you have a</font>

780
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,440
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an independent before</font>

781
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,090
transaction and independent v6

782
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,320
transaction you get information that you

783
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,510
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially conflicts with another</font>

784
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,360
these are coexistence issues that that

785
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:57,560
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of as you know we</font>

786
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:00,960
deploy ipv6 and when a<font color="#CCCCCC"> leverage ctp says</font>

787
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:07,100
things like dns server IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

788
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,100
search<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths and the sort of thing the</font>

789
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,340
this extends<font color="#E5E5E5"> further into how you want</font>

00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deploy it so for example you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are there are these be server</font>

792
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:22,319
implications out there where v4 and v6

793
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:25,290
are part of the same the same the same

794
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,720
binary and ultimately the same process

795
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,940
within the system others basically allow

796
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,950
you to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two separate</font>

797
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,310
distinct processes one for me for 156

798
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:37,830
there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one size or one shoe</font>

799
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,150
that fits all right based on your fist

800
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,500
your own deployment and your hip

801
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,770
implementations you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to</font>

802
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,870
choose which model works best for you so

803
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,280
some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider as part of this</font>

804
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:51,420
and we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked a lot about this</font>

805
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,460
internally you know you do stand-up dude

806
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,880
you go as<font color="#E5E5E5"> extreme</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want stand</font>

limitations and side effects of that all

810
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:06,250
the way to you know you know upgrading

something to be my club there is

least in in broadband environments when

841
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,400
we talk about delegating prefixes it

842
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:26,710
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that these bb6 is really the</font>

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,539
the most the most common approach to to

<font color="#E5E5E5">other techniques you know kind of</font>

846
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,609
evolving routers and that sort of thing

847
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:36,069
but from from what we've seen as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

848
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:37,869
scalability and kind of the ability to

849
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:40,990
kind of do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a central centralized</font>

850
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:42,660
manner you know these bb6 really offers

851
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:46,709
us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest exploded but again</font>

852
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,710
different strokes for different folks so

853
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,480
no we talked about this system<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ago</font>

854
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:56,140
so there's definitely there's definitely

855
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,599
incineration when it comes to how you

856
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,390
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll out these p6 if you're</font>

00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,589

858
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,960
hopefully this will get a bit more

859
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:09,360
interesting unless less

860
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:13,470
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> draw one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

around how v6 redundancy would work for

these pv6 there you know there is some

of this work in the DC working group at

883
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:21,420
essentially kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what I'll call an</font>

884
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:23,970
interim architecture for how we could do

885
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,010
these PVC fantasy and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:30,930
press details behind this in the next

887
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:34,890
few slides and it's both for unicast

888
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:36,629
allocations as well as prefixes and and

889
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:40,830
the one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you'll note about the</font>

891
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:47,279
delegation is ultimately going to it

892
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:50,190
seems to ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to push for</font>

893
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,560
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of proper or done c protocol</font>

894
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,660
right now because you know once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

895
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,850
start allocating you know fairly sizable

896
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,049
chunks of address space you need you

897
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:01,529
need some way to kind of synchronize

898
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:04,500
that between DSP servers if for nothing

899
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:06,030
else it's kind of as part of larger

900
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,070
systems within within service prior

901
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,980
networks there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are systems</font>

902
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:13,130
that interact with DSP v6 or DB servers

903
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:16,110
in general that require that information

904
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,339
so having<font color="#CCCCCC"> that available information you</font>

905
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,979
know available reliably

906
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:21,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's very important and like I said you</font>

907
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:24,509
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become more challenging</font>

908
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:29,160
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us well as we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of move more and</font>

909
00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:30,869
more into prefix delegation so I mean

00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can you can keep this as simple as</font>

overlapping prefixes on one or more DSP

914

basically these<font color="#E5E5E5"> P servers will these be</font>

of variables what you're going to see

here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more detail is something</font>

920
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:04,288
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the notion of of ranges</font>

921
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,180
which you'll see in some of the

922
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:09,180
configurations here from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IC DSP</font>

923
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:13,019
server where we've we've basically taken

924
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:15,690
unique or split essentially the split

925
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:20,519
prefixes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> assigned into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one more DHCP</font>

926
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:23,160
servers we leverage we leverage the

927
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:24,749
preference option sent down by the TTP

928
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,729
servers so in this model if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

929
00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:30,419
most simple model where you have 2 d's

930
00:42:26,729 --> 00:42:33,210
pv6 servers one with one part the first

931
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,219
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a 64 which would be a 65 and</font>

932
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:37,170
they other than the second 65 on the

933
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,930
second ESP server since you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

934
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:42,059
them with you know just for simplicity

935
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:45,719
sake one with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero preference and</font>

936
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:47,279
one with a 255 preference you says<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

937
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:49,349
have a model now where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have notion</font>

938
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:52,829
of a primary and a secondary HP v6

939
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:55,049
server clients would generally prefer

940
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:57,029
the server that sends to prep the server

941
00:42:55,049 --> 00:42:59,700
that's that sends advertisements with

942
00:42:57,029 --> 00:43:01,140
the preference of 255 so over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

943
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,029
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have one server that</font>

944
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,650
generally I guess statistically<font color="#E5E5E5"> price</font>

945
00:43:03,029 --> 00:43:06,440
safe to say it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it's</font>

946
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:09,119
going to carry the bulk of the bindings

947
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,450
because once the client receives<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

948
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,769
advertisement he'll then have to he'll

949
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:16,129
complete the exchange with the one DSP

950
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:21,149
server which will basically leave

951
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:24,859
somewhat<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an imbalance but generally</font>

952
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,859
speaking not not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

953
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:32,230
and and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that we that</font>

954
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:37,000
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed about this person particular</font>

955
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:39,880
is we had to make it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

956
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,220
timer's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> preferred the valid and the</font>

957
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:46,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">t2 timers are actually very close to one</font>

958
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:48,250
another not for the protocol behavior

959
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:50,740
between a client servers and relays but

960
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:54,190
because having those having this tree

961
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:56,830
timers too far apart essentially created

962
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,570
a gap or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a void and timing where a</font>

963
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:01,660
client would be on the network with an

964
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:04,180
IP address and if and its server that

965
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:07,060
allocated address went down there was a

966
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:09,220
point in time where an extended point in

967
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,080
time potentially where we wouldn't be

968
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,819
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get information about that that</font>

969
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,259
client anymore from from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC server</font>

970
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,760
that allocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> so by keeping those</font>

971
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:19,290
timers close together<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially what</font>

972
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do is we force the client to renew</font>

973
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:24,130
and then ultimately rebind and attempt

974
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,500
to get it acquire a new address<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

975
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:29,530
other operational server very quickly

976
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:31,210
when when it can't renew from from the

977
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,609
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server that originally that</font>

978
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:36,490
allocated the original IP address or

979
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:38,590
prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very very</font>

980
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:43,689
important detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that that we took</font>

981
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:45,790
a look at and this this seems to kind of

982
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:48,359
help us suppress some of that some of

983
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:52,060
that undesirable behavior from from a

984
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:54,400
availability point of view so what

985
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:57,490
you'll see here is basically some

986
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,070
configuration examples and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

987
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:02,470
should be cut and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pasted directly into a</font>

988
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:04,570
dot-com file for the ISE DSP server<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

989
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:08,459
actually forget what version of the

990
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:11,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">server i used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it was a 41 or 401</font>

991
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:14,560
but these are these are pretty

992
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,119
fundamental so these shouldn't be it

993
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,049
should be usable with just about any

994
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:22,090
version so again we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 server</font>

995
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:25,210
model here and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one for</font>

996
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:27,130
split ranges this one here and so you'll

997
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice here that that the prefixes are</font>

998
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:34,599
basically two unique ranges each being

999
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,950
at 65 from the same 64

1000
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:41,140
and then these overlapping was

1001
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:45,339
essentially to to DCP servers same

1002
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:46,960
preferences same prefix same range each

1003
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:48,609
with each with different considerations

1004
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,509
as far as deployments<font color="#CCCCCC"> botha's is</font>

1005
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:53,950
concerned I would encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

1006
00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it a try I mean I think it a bare</font>

1007
00:45:53,950 --> 00:46:03,779
minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be kind of cool to give it a</font>

1008
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:03,779
whirl yeah uh-huh

1009
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:10,290
nothing no because ultimately what'll

1010
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,430
happen is you'll get and I can see if I

1011
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">enable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two replicas min here so there's</font>

1012
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,580
no rap commit on this one so in that

1013
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,720
case so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was is there any</font>

1014
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,920
under the under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the table</font>

1015
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,169
synchronization that has to require

1016
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,840
everything you see here requires no

1017
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,710
special nothing special just works the

1018
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,420
weighted so what will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

1019
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,820
case in particular with the preference

1020
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,470
being the same it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be timing right the</font>

1021
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,580
client is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get both advertisers</font>

1022
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,200
back and he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make some</font>

1023
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,200
decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> based off of behavior that</font>

1024
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,390
specifies part of 33 15<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide which</font>

1025
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,310
one he's got you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know he likes better</font>

1026
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:40,009
right and then he'll go ahead and

1027
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:42,180
complete the transaction with one and

1028
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,770
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be no synchronization right</font>

1029
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,149
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the problem right which</font>

1030
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">is part of what we hoped you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1031
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,930
hopefully we can resolve in the

1032
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">not-too-distant future but there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1033
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,830
no synchronization the in this case only

1034
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:55,110
one of the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers will have</font>

1035
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:57,779
authoritative knowledge of the actual

1036
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:00,030
binding itself unless you use to rapid

1037
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:02,220
commit whereas rep commit you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1038
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">been both committed at the same time and</font>

1039
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you'd have I don't want to say a</font>

1040
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,520
replica because I'm not that's that's

1041
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,520
accurate but you'd have essentially copy

1042
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:13,259
so they were the same I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1043
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,550
you'd have you'd have you had a date

1044
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:18,180
over there as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so but but they're</font>

1045
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:20,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you unsynchronized in nature right</font>

1046
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,060
right i said<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's part of the is</font>

1047
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,060
part of the rub

1048
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,840
that's a good one so I said okay right

1049
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:35,530
so in this case in particular would all

1050
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:38,510
happen is if you try to do an allocation

1051
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:41,480
server be server be gave out in a dress

1052
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:42,650
x server a isn't aware of the servi gave

1053
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,030
it out but he now let's try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it</font>

1054
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:45,080
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and he ultimately does he says</font>

1055
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you right over</font>

1056
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,730
there in Row 3 well you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say</font>

1057
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:50,839
well I can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I he's been given</font>

1058
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,680
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do what all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i pd</font>

1059
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,380
others do and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say oh</font>

1060
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,790
look you know I did a dad and I got an

1061
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:58,190
answer for it I did duplicators

1062
00:47:55,790 --> 00:48:00,500
detection so the DS P clients should do

1063
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:01,850
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> decline and ultimately run through</font>

1064
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,190
the cycle again and get an address right

1065
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:05,750
so you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have any any</font>

1066
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:08,180
predetermined way under the covers with

1067
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,200
a DSP server to say oops<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't give</font>

1068
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,540
this one out because I already gave it

1069
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">out but it could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be back to say well I</font>

1070
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,869
got a decline message which means you

1071
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:20,690
know some other node on the network has

1072
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:22,280
that address so try again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it's</font>

1073
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:24,950
like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's functional it's not</font>

1074
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not it's not pretty it's not</font>

1075
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:34,339
perfect and pretty is relative right but

1076
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:36,410
perfect indeed is not right and this is

1077
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,270
what this is what this is what we're

1078
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:40,990
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we're going to you something</font>

1079
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks just like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1080
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:51,750
so some links<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resources which I'm</font>

1081
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:54,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure you're all aware of you know the</font>

1082
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:57,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">dicey code I don't know if you know high</font>

1083
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:58,829
seas<font color="#CCCCCC"> here or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not but uh it's a it's kind</font>

1084
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,140
of been coming around here for the last

1085
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:03,240
couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> did some early work with</font>

1086
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,618
these folks I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier with these</font>

1087
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,560
folks a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago on the on the</font>

1088
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:09,930
front end of their or a v6 imitation

1089
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:12,779
it's definitely come a long way and it's

1090
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:15,118
a it's a software package i encourage

1091
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:21,630
you to take these configurations to get

1092
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:25,440
in the world so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a basic</font>

1093
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:27,240
configuration for DTV b6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe</font>

1094
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one includes if you look about</font>

1095
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,430
two-thirds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way down the page some</font>

1096
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:37,109
configuration statement for prefix

1097
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:39,089
delegation as well so we have the first

1098
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:42,240
range the first range which should be

1099
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:44,869
just generic State Police<font color="#E5E5E5"> bb6 and then</font>

1100
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,549
we have the second one below which is a

1101
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:50,490
individual allocations<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus prefix</font>

1102
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:53,490
delegation so I also included the usage

1103
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:57,149
here largely<font color="#CCCCCC"> because i know that when</font>

1104
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:58,680
when I when I struggle to to you know

1105
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:00,329
figure out how to start things up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1106
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,740
often say<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself boy I wish somebody</font>

1107
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:02,790
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that down and shared it</font>

1108
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,220
with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the front end so i thought i</font>

1109
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,450
would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of do that as part of</font>

1110
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">these and make it so that you could</font>

1111
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:09,419
literally just if you want to give this

1112
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,300
a try you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just cut and paste and</font>

1113
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:15,270
and and hopefully be up and running in a

1114
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:19,260
very short period of time here we have

1115
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">some client examples generally speaking</font>

1116
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,270
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you don't have to use a</font>

1117
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,609
configuration file but if you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1118
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:29,040
instruct a client to do rapid commit you

1119
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:30,450
would put that rap commit statement into

1120
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,550
a configuration file make sure that you

1121
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:36,290
told the client whereas configuration

1122
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:38,819
file is and each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those each of those</font>

1123
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:41,009
examples below it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you an</font>

1124
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:44,130
explanation of what what with client

1125
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:45,270
will do in each scenario really agent

1126
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:48,240
and this is the one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular that</font>

1127
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:52,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh that i was kind of struggling with</font>

1128
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,368
believe it or not this guy here was the

1129
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,630
real agent<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think with something that i</font>

1130
00:50:53,369 --> 00:50:58,440
see added actor

1131
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:59,940
fact the<font color="#CCCCCC"> real age and so when when this</font>

1132
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,549
became available<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I want to prepare</font>

1133
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,839
this tutorial for now<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 45 I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1134
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:05,759
offer I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk with you folks</font>

1135
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:07,380
really and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks back then as well</font>

1136
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:09,509
something that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could they could</font>

1137
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,799
like you know not have to pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> money for</font>

1138
00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:13,380
they can go download it off the internet

1139
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:15,779
fire it up compile it and give it a try

1140
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:18,809
so I actually added my way to make us

1141
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:21,269
that we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a full</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a fully open source</font>

1142
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:24,000
example of what you can do with these

1143
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:26,490
vb6 and the real agent was the last

1144
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,349
piece that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I see added so I</font>

1145
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:30,508
mean I was sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add this as well as</font>

1146
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:33,180
part of the as part of the tutorial so

1147
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:34,200
hopefully you find it useful like I said

1148
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,859
I certainly encourage you to give it to

1149
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,558
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a try okay so docsis and then</font>

1150
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:43,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of home stretch for us here</font>

1151
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:47,130
how much time do we have we've got got

1152
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:50,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">some time okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some some generic</font>

1153
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:52,349
terminology here cable modems see MTS's

1154
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:53,789
so see MTS's in a cable network

1155
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:58,319
generally provide the relay agent

1156
00:51:53,789 --> 00:52:00,509
functionality and MTA is you is the

1157
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:03,660
device that<font color="#E5E5E5"> provides voice function to</font>

1158
00:52:00,509 --> 00:52:05,519
voice services in a in a cable network

1159
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:09,538
and a set-top boxes a set-top box for

1160
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:11,008
video when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have an MTA or estb or an</font>

1161
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:13,170
stb that has an e in front of it as

1162
00:52:11,009 --> 00:52:14,819
simply implies that there it's kind of

1163
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:17,069
physically embedded with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cable modem</font>

1164
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:20,180
but still logically<font color="#E5E5E5"> two separate devices</font>

1165
00:52:17,069 --> 00:52:23,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">and docsis networks we have we have mtas</font>

1166
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,019
there that and and and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cable</font>

1167
00:52:23,069 --> 00:52:26,549
modem is a prerequisite right cable

1168
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:29,308
modem provides the underlying docsis

1169
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:31,230
connectivity which enables the logical

1170
00:52:29,309 --> 00:52:33,930
device MTA or a separate box behind it

1171
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:36,660
to come online<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be provisioned right</font>

1172
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:39,779
so we have docsis which is basically the

1173
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:42,299
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cable standard system</font>

1175
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:46,980
that one Pat<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that basically defines</font>

1176
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:49,019
how Cal docsis devices like cable modems

1177
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:52,259
are provisioned on a network packet

1178

1181
00:52:56,789 --> 00:53:00,690

<font color="#E5E5E5">of this conversation DCP is considered</font>

1183
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:07,330
part provisioning so will you know

1184
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:08,680
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it at that DTV we would</font>

1186
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,660
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're pretty clear so what</font>

1187
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:16,090
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and tftp which is actually quite</font>

00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:18,640
heavily used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> docsis is the trivial</font>

1189
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:24,990

1190
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:29,520
day this<font color="#E5E5E5"> page here is some pointers to</font>

1191
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:34,120
the actual specifications for<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis</font>

1192
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:38,230
ipv6 as far as modems are concerned is

1193
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:40,720
supported in both 30 and and in some 20

1194
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:43,450
docsis devices so we have 20 devices

1195
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,730
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to support ipv6 and and 30</font>

1196
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:48,910
is kind of naturally a part of the 30

1197
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:51,070
specifications and there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1198
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:53,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">reference to least query RFC at the</font>

1199
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:56,650
bottom there's also both least query RFC

1200
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,850
that should be here<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1201
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,010
we'll kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> make reference to how that</font>

1202
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:04,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">applies here it's not i'll try to</font>

1203
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:06,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember to do so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before finished so</font>

1204
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:09,130
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part of the doc suspects</font>

1205
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,720
both three on two aspects we specify how

1206
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:12,040
these devices are going to be

1207
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,680
provisioned right so essentially what

1208
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,880
that means is in a nutshell all the

1209
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,960
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> e2b options and all the</font>

1210
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,460
different flows<font color="#E5E5E5"> all different air</font>

1211
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,320
actions that have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1212
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,840
order for this modem to come online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1213
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:27,700
allow you to get a data service or voice

1214
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:29,950
service into your house in<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis we we</font>

1215
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,569
specify different modes of operation so

1216
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:34,529
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable modems can operate in</font>

1217
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:37,300
ipv4 mode only I've to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> six mode only</font>

1218
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,920
dual stack which is both v4 and v6 or

1219
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,720
what we call alternate provisioning mode

1220
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,180
right so basically is it a fallback mode

1221
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,689
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modem that tries to</font>

1222
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:51,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up in an ipv6 but fails so he'll</font>

1223
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:54,040
not he'll he'll punt and then go to ipv4

1224
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:56,020
so the mechanics of all those modes will

1225
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,750
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of steer clear up here today and</font>

1226
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:01,780
we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how how we've</font>

1227
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,920
implemented v6 into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dock to space so</font>

1228
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:09,070
that you can actually see a real live

1229
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:12,640
use case for DSP v6 and docsis or DC v6

1230
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:14,860
I'm sorry again some some reference to

1231
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,390
some other technologies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doxies</font>

1232
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,160
leverages to you know we talked about

1233
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:20,500
txp Tod since long

1234
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,618
SNMP is heavily used to kind of manage

1235
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,839
and monitor devices and it is important

1236
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:29,289
to note that staple dhcpv6 is required

1237
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:32,049
to provision<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis devices in on 36</font>

1238
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:36,760
mode so what that says is we we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1239
00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:39,069
really have<font color="#CCCCCC"> docsis devices that can be</font>

1240
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:43,000
provisioned using stateless auto

1241
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:45,579
configuration on cable network and of

1242
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:50,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">course this before is that remains</font>

1243
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:53,890
generally the same so in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis</font>

1244
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:57,280
environments again we we used ESP p6 to

1245
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:59,288
not only acquire individual IP addresses

1246
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,510
for cable modems<font color="#CCCCCC"> for management but also</font>

1247
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:04,839
for anything behind it assuming you can

1248
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:06,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">support it there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be also will also</font>

1249
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:08,859
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to provide out to be 6</font>

1250
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,020
addresses for unicast address as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1251
00:56:08,859 --> 00:56:12,549
prefixes so again pointing back to you

1252
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:14,890
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use of these bb6 for previous</font>

1253
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:17,288
delegation that's what we use it for as

1254
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:21,220
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are certainly using it in that</font>

1255

1266
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:54,970
i'll definitely elaborate on some on

some options<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we specify that and</font>

that we heavily leveraged to tonight of

enable v6 on the docks inside of the

we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have modem capabilities which</font>

1282
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:41,999
are very much docsis constructs and we

1283
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:44,460
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a device identifier right so</font>

1284
00:57:41,999 --> 00:57:47,399
if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> think back you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1285
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:50,519
however many slides back<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned to</font>

1286
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:53,160
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in DSP v6 we have a DUI d and</font>

1287
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:54,419
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UID is essentially not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and generally</font>

1288
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,269
not a mac address right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1290
00:57:56,269 --> 00:58:02,999
so what we did is part of making sure

1291
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:06,299
that we orchestrated this to support our

1292
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:08,459
adoption of you six we under our own

1293
00:58:06,299 --> 00:58:10,890
enterprise ID we basically specified a

1294
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:13,170
device identifier option which which

1295
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:15,960
basically contains the 48 bit mac dress

1296
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:17,609
of other device so any device that

1297
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,339
adheres to the docks of specification

1298
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:22,650
which includes cable modem or or you

1299
00:58:20,339 --> 00:58:25,980
know mtas or set-top boxes or what have

1300
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:27,329
you will contain this information this

1301
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually very subtle but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1302
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:32,849
important we leverage this heavily to to

1303
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:34,288
not only minimize the impact of optic

1304

<font color="#E5E5E5">change you know the model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is</font>

itself one thing being in stocks is

1333
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:53,789
version the second bullet here which is

1334
00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:57,569
a kid my mac address is essentially the

1335
00:59:53,789 --> 01:00:00,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">equivalent to the remote ID behavior in</font>

01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:31,019
that we saw earlier let's see so now so

1346
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,369
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually came from a cable modem</font>

1348
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:42,750
we've specified for the support of

subsequent slides here that we are not

1353

we are not in this case using rapid

1354

<font color="#CCCCCC">have a I think it's just as link layer</font>

plus x UID and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that you</font>

1357
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:12,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">should take note of in this slide this</font>

1358
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:15,569
slide here is this is pretty ugly this

1359
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:17,609
this sniffer text cat that the text

1360

version of this temper trace<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger</font>

1361
01:01:17,609 --> 01:01:23,279
because the stipper trace is the

1362
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:26,069
Wireshark adapters today don't know how

1363
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:28,319
to decode the cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> abs vendor</font>

1364
01:01:26,069 --> 01:01:30,900
information options so one of my

colleagues up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable industry and</font>

1368
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:41,399
functionality to Wireshark we're going

1369
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,750
to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because you know when you is</font>

1370
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,549
it's inevitable that will be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1371
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:47,130
stiffer traces for DC v6 packets and

1372
01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:51,900
clearly looking at this mess here is not

1373
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:54,319
going to be quite so useful so so

1374
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:57,299
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really did leave it in there</font>

1375
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:59,190
deliberately to kind of kind of indicate

1376
01:01:57,299 --> 01:02:00,930
to you that you know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:02,670
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to do out there as</font>

1381
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:10,440
we've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that we've got</font>

01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we augment those tools to</font>

1383
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,410
support the support again so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

1386
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:21,779
again I you know kind of not to belabor

1387
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:25,549
the flow here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again list advertise</font>

1388
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:28,260
requests reply and all these are

1389
01:02:25,549 --> 01:02:29,400
generally available as part of the you

1390
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:36,720
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide deck that you can</font>

1391
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:39,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">download and next I'll show you kind of</font>

1392
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,759
reconfigure in action and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1393
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially the flow for reconfigure so</font>

1394
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:48,390
in our case will trigger this from a DSP

1395
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:50,430
v6 server generally in our case you cast

1396
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:53,700
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the modem in this case</font>

1397
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:57,240
and and subsequent that it'll trigger

1398
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:59,189
renew in this case a renewal so you'll

1399
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:01,200
see that the reconfigure message is

1400
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,910
being sent down and I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1401
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,649
have the header portion of the packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1402
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:08,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">here the reconfigure message is being</font>

1403
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:12,480
sent down to the client and followed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1404
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:17,250
the renew message from from from the

1405
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:21,680
same client and then ultimately reply so

1406
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:27,960
that is that is the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tutorial</font>

1407
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:30,359
that is essentially you know my my

1408
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:35,130
overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these people sick for you</font>

1409
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:38,190
and a use case in doc says happy to take

1410
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:43,339
some questions if anybody has any by all

1411
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:43,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">means sure yeah probably a spy good idea</font>

1412
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:53,990
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much for this thing I'm we</font>

1413
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:56,299
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any need at the moment for</font>

1414
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:59,200
dhcpv6 on our network but it's very

1415
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:02,270
instructive to learn how this is working

1416
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:06,919
can you tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that last slide where</font>

1417
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:10,759
the the dhcp server wanted to force a

1418
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:13,580
given client to to reconfigure to come

1419
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:16,790
back and ask me again how does it know

1420
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:20,090
which relay agent to send that to in the

1421
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:22,070
dhcp were before case generally the

1422
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,570
relay agent was sort of in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of</font>

1423
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:26,300
the transaction during the transaction

1424
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:28,250
but afterward the server could forget

1425
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:30,440
all about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you relay agent it</font>

1426
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:32,570
was really just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that I have</font>

1427
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:36,470
given<font color="#E5E5E5"> this IP address out to this guy</font>

1428
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:37,850
way far away yep so so so the component

1429
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:39,830
clarification in this case in this

1430
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:41,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">example it was actually unicast from the</font>

1431
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:42,950
server to the client so it wasn't sent

1432
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,930
to the relay agent it was sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1433
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:46,640
directly to the modem and serve on the

1434
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:48,919
server knows that because he's got he's

1435
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:50,509
looking in his database for and he has

1436
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,670
two binding right so you if you can

1437
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:54,500
envision like a user interface where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1438
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:56,240
could look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the all the bindings</font>

1439
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,160
computer and DSP<font color="#E5E5E5"> service I oh look</font>

1440
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,330
there's an IP address I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click</font>

1441
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">on it and that I want to send a</font>

1442
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:03,950
reconfigure message to it so now

1443
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,050
assuming that you have you know you know

1444
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:07,430
reckon you know connectivity<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the</font>

1445
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:09,620
server and the client which you should

1446
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:10,700
have that'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> double unique as message</font>

1447
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:12,710
now there is the ability to send

1448
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:14,450
reconfigure by the right by the relay

1449
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:16,430
and you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's probably</font>

1450
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">these packets the server is aware of</font>

1451
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">with real agent it's alright so the</font>

1452
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:21,770
server would have to record that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1453
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,660
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from yeah it would ya</font>

1454
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:26,780
otherwise it has otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

1455
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:28,790
have to specify<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the fly as a user or</font>

1456
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,710
you're simply without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the appropriate</font>

1458
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:37,300
reconfigure by a reply real agent<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1459
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:43,570
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and my other question is about</font>

1460
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:47,860
prefix allocation that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP now I</font>

1461
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:50,510
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to distinguish between</font>

1462
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:51,170
regular dsl customers who are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1463
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:53,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be behind</font>

1464
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:56,630
a home Pat router and just need one

1465
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:58,549
address but then if they say Oh what can

1466
01:05:56,630 --> 01:06:00,470
you give me several addresses it becomes

1467
01:05:58,549 --> 01:06:01,490
a whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh hold on a minute I'm</font>

1468
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:03,549
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a statically</font>

1469
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:06,109
assigned address I'm gonna have to

1470
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:07,520
remember somewhere which<font color="#E5E5E5"> sub that you</font>

1471
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:10,430
were assigned I'm going to have to put

1472
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:13,730
the static routing into somewhere and

1473
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:15,649
redistribute it to somewhere and it

1474
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:18,290
seems that this whole process has been

1475
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:19,609
thought about a lot in dhcpv6 but pretty

1476
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:21,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">much anybody is going to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

1477
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:25,460
give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little / 56 any whole time</font>

1478
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:27,410
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool I see how it works in the</font>

1479
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,849
dhcp server itself how does it work in

1480
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:30,980
the rest of the infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> how does</font>

1481
01:06:28,849 --> 01:06:33,680
the that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great bloody IP route blah</font>

1482
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:35,329
to blah get injected into your router

1483
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,950
that's a really good question it's kind

1484
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:38,720
of timely because one of the things that

1485
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:43,129
were working on as<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the working</font>

1486
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:45,169
group is there's a there's a really it's

1487
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:48,349
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rant option and it essentially</font>

1488
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:53,589
is an option that gets transmitted as

1489
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:55,670
part of the response back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP and</font>

1490
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:57,349
it's kind of been in a working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1491
01:06:55,670 --> 01:07:04,069
a bit we had it we had it refreshed in

1492
01:06:57,349 --> 01:07:06,440
in advance of ITF 70 in San Francisco 74

1493
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:10,040
and basically it is an option that

1494
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:14,329
specifies that that is sent back by the

1495
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:17,599
server detected by the relay agent and

1496
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:21,589
allows for the injection essentially of

1497
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:24,020
a route into the relay agent so the

1498
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:25,849
questions you're asking I think is ok if

1499
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:28,579
I'm a home gateway and I've now we've

1500
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:32,210
gotten been delegated the prefix me

1501
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:33,650
learning my default route is not so big

1502
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:35,059
of a deal I can just use router

1503
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:37,010
advertisements<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my North my router to</font>

1504
01:07:35,059 --> 01:07:38,510
do that but how do I make sure that the

1505
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,920
rest of the network oops sorry about

1506
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:44,809
that no the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network knows</font>

1507
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:46,430
that that router ever there is right

1508
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:47,900
right so this R an option you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should you</font>

1509
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,980
should take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at if you want to</font>

1510
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,510
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because in your point</font>

1511
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:53,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but it's really for the benefit</font>

1512
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:55,940
anyway so it's a fantastic question it

1513
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:58,099
really it's the enabler that that you

1514
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:01,130
that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used to for the initial</font>

1515
01:07:58,099 --> 01:08:02,930
route injection so if you also so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1516
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:03,930
solves the first problem right now how

1517
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:05,370
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get that</font>

1518
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:08,759
how you create awareness in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

1519
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:09,990
as to where that prefix gets all the

1520
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">charm for that previous gets routed to</font>

1521
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:14,879
brand option is kind of the initial you

1522
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:17,580
know could provide the ability to

1523
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:21,660
provide that initial injection of the

1524
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:23,850
route you'll recall<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsequently in the</font>

1525
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:27,569
deck here we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rico lease</font>

1526
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:31,020

1528
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,310
tended to basically allow for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font>

01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:39,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">agent that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially responsible</font>

1530

1531
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:46,439

1534

1549
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:23,490
routing information that could provide

1550
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:25,679
for that that's ultimately mechanism

1551
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:28,590
that can be used to to keep it current

1552
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,940
to keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> fresh so there's there's kind</font>

1553
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:31,110
of two bits and just kind of two pieces

1554
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:32,669
in play there right there's the initial

1555
01:09:31,109 --> 01:09:34,679
there's the initial population and then

1556
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:36,810
there's a subsequent kind of refreshing

1557
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,670
of information routing information if

1558
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:42,810
the infrastructure that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great</font>

1559
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:46,130
that sounds it from the if everything is

1560
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:51,270
as automatic as you're describing that

1561
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:53,430

01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:56,280
it could bring down the cost to the end
