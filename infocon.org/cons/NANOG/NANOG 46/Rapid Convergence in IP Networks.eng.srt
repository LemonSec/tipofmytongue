1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,360
okay hi I'm Tom<font color="#CCCCCC"> shal with ATT and I'll</font>

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,820
probably be the last presentation before

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,660
lunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> so people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> walk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out I don't know if</font>

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,619
it's because they're leaving it they

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,970
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it anyhow this</font>

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,039
presentation is going to be about rapid

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,750
convergence and IP networks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,000
basically just get things out of the way

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,619
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of urgent we're not talking</font>

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,029
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know Twitter Facebook Linkedin</font>

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,439
different applications coming together

12
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,060
it's nothing like that we're

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,278
specifically talking about perversions

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,239
as it relates to high IP networks route

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,530
around failures and network changes and

16
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,839
basically we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,190
the injured in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network not talking</font>

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,600
about external of what happens when

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,640
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> EBG preparing to all</font>

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,140
different autonomous systems this is

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">just really with inside your own domain</font>

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,840
your own house so you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,980
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> really trying to solve when</font>

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,780
dealing with the convergence and

25
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,390
basically events occur within you know

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,850
IP networks that can typically result in

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,079
traffic being dropped and one that we

28
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,059
have traffic being dropped there's

29
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,830
typically the you know the result of it

30
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,810
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be due to congestion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd be a</font>

31
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,548
<font color="#CCCCCC">forwarding errors such as a link has</font>

32
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,720
gone down traffic's getting black hold

33
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,610
it could be some sort of forwarding

34
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,140
issue on your actual equipment where

35
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,790
traffic is not being written to the

36
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,770
right line card and then it drops and

37
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,420
finally the last option is TTL

38
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,950
expiration which is pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

39
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,720
sign if you are experiencing a large

40
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,729
amounts of TTL expiration that there's

41
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,200
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a routing loop at play</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that or</font>

42
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's actually just traceroute but</font>

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,340
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttls are good signed a point</font>

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,320
that something's actually looping back

45
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,729
and forth and basically the whole idea

46
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">is all what the convergence is really</font>

47
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,320
the time that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can recover from some</font>

48
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,610
sort of event like this and you know why

49
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,158
is this bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know why we're</font>

50
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,140
bringing us about you know IP networks

51
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,280
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know rapid convergence is that</font>

52
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,259
you know frequently a lot of people

53
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">compare sauna and other types of</font>

54
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,310
transport services to IP and you know

55
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,619
the notion or<font color="#CCCCCC"> its you know the rumors</font>

56
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,479
say or different people say that you

57
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it you can't get IP networks to</font>

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,780
actually go that fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can tree</font>

59
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,969
converge that fast it's best<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for</font>

60
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,439
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few seconds and and the reality</font>

61
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">is you can actually do some pretty</font>

62
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,469
interesting things within your you know

63
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,350
within your own autonomous system and

64
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,840
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to right around failures</font>

65
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,038
it is feasible but and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of</font>

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,860
presentation covers pretty much what are

67
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,450
your options and

68
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,400
regarde if you actually do try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to aim to</font>

69
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:20,260
do it and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what kind of</font>

70
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,610
things will run into so really who who

71
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who actually do care</font>

72
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,750
about rapid conversions and you know the

73
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,570
specific applications um you know voice

74
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,070
over IP IP based call<font color="#CCCCCC"> centres some of</font>

75
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,269
them are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggressive in terms of</font>

76
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,070
what happens when they drop a few

77
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,780
packets for several seconds they'll

78
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,070
terminate a call there's some phone

79
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,920
handsets that will actually you know

80
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,700
soft reboot if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to their</font>

81
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,980
central device that they're

82
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,230
communicating with another one is in the

83
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">video space</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and just IPTV and other</font>

84
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,760
types of video<font color="#CCCCCC"> that very sensitive</font>

85
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,310
dropping any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of frames depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the codecs that are used video is</font>

87
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,120
another sensitive one and finally

88
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,620
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one would be secular mobile</font>

89
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,410
networks where you have like cig Tran

90
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,090
signaling you have voice traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing</font>

91
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,209
and some mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> network save you know</font>

92
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,830
gone from having you know from mobile

93
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,180
you know voice data<font color="#E5E5E5"> going over ATM</font>

94
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,100
networks that they've actually some

95
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,020
places actually replaced it with IP mpls

96
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,209
networks and they're running pseudo

97
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,950
wires to keep part of that ATM

98
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,560
infrastructure still<font color="#E5E5E5"> alive and in those</font>

99
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,170
cases they're still running you know the

100
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,910
actual older architectures on your IP

101
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,100
networks but they still have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me meet</font>

102
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,690
that level of reliability and basically

103
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,920
the other one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much anybody</font>

104
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,260
who's been buying legacy you know

105
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,780
transport services who is accustomed to

106
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,950
a particular type of behavior and you

107
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,330
know maybe they're transitioning into a

108
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,738
layer through VPN and they have the

109
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,120
expectation that hey it should just be

110
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,709
fast as what I had before um so what are

111
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">the kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forgets that you</font>

112
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,530
know if you're a service provider you

113
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,540
know whatever you're building you know

114
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,280
what what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe would you have to</font>

115
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,230
support from your individual customers

116
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,150
right and what it comes down to is each

117
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,260
application has its own you know amount

118
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,590
of threshold of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it can handle</font>

119
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">before things degrade or break and one</font>

120
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,160
common thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does seem to come up</font>

121
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,040
quite a bit is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a 50</font>

122
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,390
millisecond goal or golden standard that

123
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,829
everyone tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build to or at least</font>

124
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about or at least demand as a</font>

125
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,980
requirement right and they say we you

126
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have 50 milliseconds</font>

127
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,359
that's on it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know or you know in</font>

128
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,370
some cases even sub-second are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for</font>

129
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,320
some people but 50 milliseconds is

130
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,269
really the name comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up quite a bit and</font>

131
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,420
would it really come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from well the telco</font>

132
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,920
world not a surprise

133
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,050
and it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

134
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,360
standard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was set for the heel time</font>

135
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,160
on sonnet rings and but the thing was

136
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,720
there was really no specific application

137
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,400
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the end user space it said</font>

138
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,720
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need 50 milliseconds there was</font>

139
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,580
nothing out there it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much a</font>

140
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,820
standard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was set and everyone's</font>

141
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,090
been trying to meet it so um next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

142
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">is well going back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the convergence</font>

143
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,810
topic well you know now that we know

144
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,920
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is 50 millisecond</font>

145
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,630
thing that you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

146
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,490
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet some people try to get</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole operation can take a</font>

to even seconds in a few cases depending

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,370
on the hardware how busy that hardware

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,820
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do make some kind of change</font>

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,380
router is doing different functions

183
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,080
somebody might be processing<font color="#CCCCCC"> PGP</font>

184
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,640
somebody's SNMP walking in other box you

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,960
know SPF is going to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's going</font>

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,840
to its<font color="#CCCCCC"> runtimes going to be different on</font>

187
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,609
every box throughout the network so it's

188
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,640
a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a ton of us action unnie unnie</font>

189
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,370
trotter so you know what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of happens</font>

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,810
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a HIV convergence type of event first</font>

191
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,340
of all you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect it right and</font>

192
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,690
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's hard enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in some</font>

193
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,179
cases because depending on the media

194
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:21,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have you know if you have layer</font>

195
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">3 adjacency protocols setup you have</font>

196
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,850
dead timers that you can set and you can

197
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,080
crank down to be lower but basically the

198
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,210
first thing you know you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

199
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">about coverage you've detected well once</font>

200
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,049
you detect it then you certainly need to

201
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,050
advertise the topology changes within

202
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,860
the network right so tell everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

203
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,000
will happen and then

204
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,259
you have to take all those updates they

205
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,590
have to push down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the individual</font>

206
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:43,360
interfaces and packaged out then what

207
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,008
everybody does hear about the event they

208
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,389
have to recalculate SPF then once again

209
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,219
you know update the local ribbon the

210
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,569
router and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then finally update the</font>

211
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:51,639
forwarding plane which is actually what

212
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:55,090
you know makes the difference when it

213
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,139
comes to where the traffic is going you

214
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,758
know so if you're going to embark on

215
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,349
this path of you know you know want to

216
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">do something better than just a default</font>

217
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:03,909
config you know defaults aren't going to

218
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,310
cut it right you're going to have to

219
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:08,229
tweak a few knobs when vendors ship

220
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,879
boxes you know new code updates they

221
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,349
don't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of convergence changes</font>

222
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,400
in the default command lines right

223
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,779
because there's somebody who's probably

224
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,799
running with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a default</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is happy with</font>

225
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:15,909
that and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have you</font>

226
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,830
know upgrade code and all of a sudden

227
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the behaviors change so typically</font>

228
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,949
there's going to be a few knobs that

229
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,878
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to tweak and those</font>

230
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,800
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those are going to vary from</font>

231
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,159
playing with SPF intervals throughout

232
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,180
Alzheimer's flooding controls some

233
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:30,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">commands that are going to be related</font>

234
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FIB</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and programming some</font>

235
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,580
things within the rib itself and then

236
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,020
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all you're going to have to</font>

237
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,789
worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the rap you know failure</font>

238
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,229
detection and there's a few things there

239
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,360
you worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about layer to keep the lives</font>

240
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:43,690
you could do things with the lowered<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

241
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,520
timers although then that's one way

242
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,740
another way you know certainly BFD works

243
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,789
as well if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and scale</font>

244
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,319
it pretty well but on top of defaults

245
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,909
you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to converge really fast</font>

246
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,740
right and so far up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this point we</font>

247
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,419
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know recalculation has</font>

248
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,860
to happen right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you really want</font>

249
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:01,628
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fast and you want to you know get</font>

250
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,069
it to be somewhat sub-second you're

251
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,419
going to have to rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on something</font>

252
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a little bit better when</font>

253
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,948
interacting with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FIB is to getting</font>

254
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:10,810
traffic routing on the right path um you

255
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,990
know with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right knobs even with just</font>

256
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,669
plain vanilla<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP depend how large you</font>

257
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,960
know your internal routing table is you

258
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:18,639
can still get within the hundred

259
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,198
milliseconds range I mean that it's

260
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,400
certainly feasible but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

261
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,039
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have to for whatever</font>

262
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,589
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know aim you know go for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

263
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,270
lower value there's really two options i

264
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:31,060
really come about and that's basically

265
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,860
the IP faster ero and mpls te fast free

266
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,089
round so just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have another</font>

267
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,269
slide here just kind of going into IP

268
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:38,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">faster ear out and then you know the</font>

269
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:41,860
rest of the talk kind of goes into some

270
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:43,718
that dilemmas associate<font color="#E5E5E5"> EE but if I</font>

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">p-pass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're out basically one really</font>

272
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,029
nice thing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is it doesn't</font>

273
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">require on pls so if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

274
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,529
committed to using labels and you don't

275
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,060
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

276
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,610
labels or you don't want to continue to

277
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:56,859
use them this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is possible viable</font>

278
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:59,029
option for you it basically builds to

279
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,490
you know some implications that are out

280
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:03,319
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe XR has it today in Isis</font>

281
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,990
and you know I think that will

282
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:07,339
eventually go to ospf and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

283
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,139
if any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other vendors actually support it</font>

284
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,209
today but basically it does provide a

285
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:13,850
rapid way for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp to actually you</font>

286
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:16,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">know have the alternate routes already</font>

287
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,490
in place you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some issues</font>

288
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,439
with sr LG should risk link groups and

do any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of explicit path routing but</font>

304
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:56,599
that's because you're not you know

305
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,100
clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing anything with labels so I</font>

306

mean it's got its own trade-offs but

307
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,699
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit not as heavy-handed</font>

308
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:06,199
isn't you know committing yourself to

309
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:07,729
our for VTE the other way is with mpls

310
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:09,649
te faster you're out which has been out

311
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,819
for you know quite a while and there's

312
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,680
really two ways you can kind of do this

313
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,420
right you can basically have you know a

314
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,559
head on<font color="#E5E5E5"> over outer when you build an LSP</font>

315
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,540
somewhere you could basically have a

316
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,399
secondary LSP that's standing by and

317
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,259
ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so as soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as it gets a path</font>

318
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,790
error message<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can then switch over to</font>

319
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:26,120
your second path right in that second

320
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:28,069
half to be explicitly created or you

321
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,809
know you could you have it defined or

322
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:30,979
you know some routers implementations

323
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:33,679
will actually go off and try to build a

324
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,839
second LSP from a diverse path from what

325
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,129
was originally created the other option

326
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,069
is that you could do it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a per link by</font>

327
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:42,319
link or<font color="#CCCCCC"> facility based bypass LSP which</font>

328
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:43,969
lets you protected individual tunnels as

329
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:45,559
you go hop by hop through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network or</font>

330
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,660
individual links as you go across the

331
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:48,920
network and the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fib</font>

332
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,689
is pre-programmed with instructions

for right now

340
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,160
and then we notify everybody who had a

341
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,449

343
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,660

you know doing te FR because you're

346
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,940
taking traffic that's on a path it's

347
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,440
typically you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially shorter</font>

348
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,970
and now you could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting it on a</font>

00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,389
task the problem with you know is having

the visibility is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the layer one network</font>

and knowing where actually things route

00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,029
if you can get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that</font>

374
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,529
it's it's definitely great to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

own<font color="#CCCCCC"> your facilities you obviously have</font>

380

381
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,979
that's certainly good but even then you

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,139
still have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to parse through the data and</font>

depending on what you could do um you

know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are lucky enough that you</font>

you go to actually build your backup

if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go on the path of how</font>

are you know bandwidth or sorry by

bandwidth on the backup path right you

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,229
know building capacity if you know just

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,109
you know bypass LSPs are you actually

420

gonna have the bandwidth in place there

421
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,750
or otherwise you're just going to be

422
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,239
dropping<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets and what's the point of</font>

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,260
doing it anyways in the first place and

424
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">then on top of that do you have any</font>

latency limitations right if you're

426

punting people on a backup<font color="#E5E5E5"> path is it</font>

427
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,470
going on longer path do you have SLA

00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,589
prove it right you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> log into the</font>

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,470
routers and say oh well we've got the

531
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,710
it must be true but once again the

control plane on a router doesn't always

533

match up what happens to the forwarding

538
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,030
they log in the routers I say well the

541
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:25,000
we think that's what the convergence

568
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,470
boat of okay well some people get this

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,000
exp value but if they want our service

570
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they give this other exp value and</font>

571
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,700
then they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on this different</font>

set of tunnels and you know the

00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,240
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really how can you you know if</font>

579
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,130
you do have some kind of desire to do is

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,200
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> from defaults to something and</font>

581
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,690
playing with knobs a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just put</font>

some simple you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know little bullets here</font>

584
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,050
definitely search online more about

these commands in iOS as well as in

know one to two second hold on that

595
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:08,840
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font>

knobs that are related to how stuff is

598

you know your mileage may vary once

602
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,730
again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp there's plenty of knobs</font>

are as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of SPF</font>

throttling by default SPF initial the

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,190
initial SPF is five seconds is that

606
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,710
something you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be waiting for or</font>

607
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,210
do you want to drop that a bit lower you

I think a linkage between the route you

clean and then on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> juniper side you</font>

616
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,770
know it next hop in direction and which

playing with some of the SPF timers as

619
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,710
well so um this is just some cheat sheet

620
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,090
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas you know if you want to look</font>

621
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,130
into this there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

622
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">there there's a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wikipedia wiki pages</font>

623
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,460
out there they have some tips on things

624
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do and of course it varies on</font>

625
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,040
different platforms as well so 76

626
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,510
hundreds GSR is totally different so

627
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely worth research if you want to</font>

628
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,660
have a place to start that would be

629
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,100
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go but you know you definitely</font>

630
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,750
ask yourself when you're building a

631
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,219
network you know what are you really

632
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,050
trying to go you know what is your

633
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,610
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it one specific customer who</font>

634
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,930
wants us and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it really has a</font>

635
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,040
you know in fact across your whole

636
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,650
network because if you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> building</font>

637
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,850
towards one specific target um you know

638
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,620
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make things a bit more</font>

639
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,270
complex and you know you have other

640
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,229
customers you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to serve as well so</font>

641
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:40,730
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely lot to think about so</font>

642
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,730
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sound if there's any questions</font>

643
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,940
hey Tom no question but I know when the

644
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,690
50 milliseconds comes from if you want

645
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,669
to know gr 253 there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in GRE</font>

646
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,230
253 that declares 50 milliseconds force

647
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:58,730
on switching it it comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old</font>

648
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,460
data storage networks of the old days

649
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">think like EMC time frame they require</font>

650
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,240
15 milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch over how it</font>

651
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,559
worked its way into the telephony world

652
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:15,080
I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you but 200 is the</font>

653
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:18,440
magic number i think all right and hung

654
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">capella voxel net so mr. shoal thank you</font>

was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the result um I haven't level udld</font>

661
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,500
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean in the past you know done</font>

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,650
some work at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ft and was he other one</font>

just<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP stuff like into in practice did</font>

664
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,780
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any good data out of this the</font>

666
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,960
mean you know past experimentations I

667
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:50,480
mean it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pretty much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the heb</font>

668
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,250
stuff is if you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> small scale</font>

669
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,200
routing you know not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of prefixes</font>

670
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,000
not a lot of adjacencies the box isn't

671
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,490
too busy you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can crank down the</font>

672
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">igp timers pretty well and you know do</font>

673
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,360
fine but otherwise you know that that

674
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,799
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for everybody and BFD works</font>

675
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,899
out but then<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD has its own skin</font>

676
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,540
limitation so it's definitely you know

677
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,059
that they certainly work it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends</font>

678
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:14,470
what what box you're using how loaded is

679
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:19,970
it and how big is your network right

680
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:23,179
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quick question so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

681
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:26,059
assuming you did this for our<font color="#E5E5E5"> column our</font>

682
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:28,070
legacy vanilla type IP cores have you

00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:30,230
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same analysis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,830
bgp free course that all of our vendors

685
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:37,130
are trying to convince us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move to yes</font>

686
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:39,168
same results um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean taking vgp</font>

687
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,559
off the boxes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cord as does</font>

688
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:44,809
wonders i think in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of if you have</font>

689
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,520
a full table on it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

690
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:48,260
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't need to be there and taking</font>

691
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,000
it off<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it definitely helped in</font>

692
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:55,220
terms of cpu utilization but I mean how

693
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,840
much I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not all that sure I mean it was</font>

694
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,730
nice to get on this particular case

695
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,559
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> beach be off was nice because</font>

696
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,510
having on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full table routes</font>

697
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,690
and different you know neck when there

698
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:07,760
was convergence I recall there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some</font>

699
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:11,240
some some delays associated with it I

700
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:16,100
mean it I think overall it helped having

<font color="#CCCCCC">bgp off the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> core boxes thanks Richard</font>

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:26,480
delegate if you have a modern

705
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,049
architecture with distributed forwarding

706
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,030
t series and 3 20 MX things like that it

707
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:33,860
will run your life for example your BF d

708
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,559
or your other<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep alive processes</font>

709
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,030
directly off the cpu of the line card

710
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,850
instead of the routing engine and that

711
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,720
can help performance yeah definitely

712
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

713
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,730
was on the junipers you can distribute

714
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:49,190
the ppm process which handles all the

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,419

718
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:56,330
actually has to run on the routing

719
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,860
engine for like things like pseudo wires

720
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:03,678
or link bundles where it can't be

721
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:06,139
distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so that's it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>
