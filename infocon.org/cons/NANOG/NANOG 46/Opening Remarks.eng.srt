119
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:36,289
know the protocol is not to wear a tie

120
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:38,360
but in fact I have to be somewhere right

121
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:41,389
after this where they're expecting it to

122
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,039
wear a tie and if somebody would be you

123

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,710
here in center city and I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all</font>

143
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:32,779
of you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take some time to do that i</font>

144
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,789
thought i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a few minutes just</font>

145
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking a little bit about part of what</font>

146
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,360
we see and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think you would find</font>

147
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,849
hopefully that there's some common

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,169
ground or understanding here and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

149
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,899
the things that's driving our business

150
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:46,339
is this digital generation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really</font>

151
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,360
wanted to spend just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second on who</font>

152
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,520
they are and what are the

153
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,860
locations of that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know these are the</font>

154
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,159
Echo Boomers I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion</font>

155
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,590
these are folks that have more value

156
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:59,000
around time than perhaps money although

157
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly changed in the last</font>

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,289
six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see over</font>

159
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,349
400 attendees given the<font color="#CCCCCC"> current economic</font>

160
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:08,120
climate here at<font color="#CCCCCC"> man</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on 46 but this is an</font>

161
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,800
interesting generation because if you're

162
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,259
like me some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we now</font>

163
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,419
work with today we've seen these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

164
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:16,250
come into our lives at a certain period

165
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,159
of time but there's a whole generation

166
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,439
of folks who work and just born into the

167
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:23,479
natural availability of well pcs have

168
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,430
been here forever and so has in cell

169
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:27,830
phones and so hasn't you know 500 TV

170
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,180
stations these are the true multitaskers

171
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,008
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watch some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my kids</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are in</font>

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">college in high school it's kind of</font>

173
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:35,000
unbelievable<font color="#CCCCCC"> their ability to multitask</font>

174
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,979
but that has implications for all of us

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,479
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some big implications</font>

176
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,449
and we see that around the needs of

177
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,438
social networking and how they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

178
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:44,509
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always talk</font>

183
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:55,490
into one funnel so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could get to me</font>

184
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:58,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I find that we're all connected</font>

185
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,779
we're all very reachable over many types

186
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,180
of media and now we're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is</font>

187
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:04,250
managing our offline presence which is

188
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,110
quite interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> these folks are into</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">industry is really driven what I call</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of nonlinear product growth I mean</font>

195
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,919
these are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry</font>

196
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,560
has been dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with throughout</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

198
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,789
product rope I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that translates</font>

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,438
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things here technology</font>

00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:32,088
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure explosion I think</font>

201
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new message to</font>

202
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,500
anybody here but if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

203
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:38,120
increasing number of servers if you look

204
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,440
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the increasing amount of storage</font>

205
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,779
that's been shipped not only

206
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,579
commercially but personally and you look

207
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,980
at the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic that's on the</font>

208
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:47,870
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet all of these facets are</font>

209
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,820
being driven and grown exponentially and

210
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,329
I think largely the digital generation

211
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,130
and a lot of the applications that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

212
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:57,529
basically come into play and will

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,870
continue to evolve are driving this kind

214
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:00,529
of infrastructure so this is really not

215
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,779
great

216
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:04,100
new news to this group but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought it</font>

217
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,069
was important to kind of point that out

218
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,709
now as it relates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Tanana just some</font>

219
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:11,329
thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share and this</font>

220
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,529
is not you know new to the group as well

221
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,859
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing this for many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

222
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:17,420
in the previous 45<font color="#CCCCCC"> knots is to really</font>

223
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,939
look at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these inner working and</font>

224
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,610
operability opportunities if you will

225
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:26,209
with IP as a technology with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the various</font>

226
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:28,879
connectivity layers not just IP and both

227
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:31,008
the bearer and the signaling planes of

228
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,360
what we do so I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

229
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:34,399
working groups that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a lot of</font>

230
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">things but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just want you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's not</font>

231
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,990
often that I get the opportunity to sort

232
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:40,699
of provide a point of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this so in</font>

233
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,290
addition to all the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups and</font>

234
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:44,329
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been happening in nanog</font>

235
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,649
and are continuing to happen here are

236
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:47,930
some areas that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wanted to draw a</font>

237
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:50,240
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to in terms of</font>

238
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,459
interoperability on 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig optics I</font>

239
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,889
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're at a moment in time</font>

240
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:57,439
where in fact this group in this room

241
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:59,930
the service providers the technology

242
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:01,790
companies it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important from my</font>

243
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">point of view that as an industry we</font>

244
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,569
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to make hundred gig</font>

245
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:07,128
optics interoperable especially as we

246
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:08,930
interconnect our networks and grow and

247
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:12,050
scale perhaps we can do that as a

248
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,508
foundation so that even beyond 100 gig

249
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,128
whatever the next stop might be 400 gig

250
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:18,500
that we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way that it's a</font>

251
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,000
repeatable process second I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

252
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a couple of opportunities here</font>

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">in terms of the IP and the optics layer</font>

254
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:26,750
and the control plane signaling and the

255
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,699
types of things that perhaps can be done

256
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,319
with redundancy and resiliency in the

257
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:31,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's work</font>

258
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:34,399
going on here that's really really

259
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,399
important to tie the layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> one optics to</font>

260
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,410
layer through a layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three IP layer</font>

261
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,180
third securing and protecting the

262
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,709
infrastructure I think this has always

263
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,779
been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the Charter it's always</font>

264
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,969
been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the priorities but my</font>

265
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,160
sense is is that this awareness and the

266
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,750
priority around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this continues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

267
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,540
escalate and I know there's working

268
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,009
groups around pgp security and things

269
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,639
like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big area</font>

270
00:10:55,009 --> 00:11:02,870
for us to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time in nanog also</font>

271
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,970
ipv4 and ipv6 interworking this is an

272
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,160
area where the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been working</font>

273
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,050
on it for a very very long time I think

274
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,689
there's different states of acceptance

275
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,790
adoption denial you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all of those</font>

276
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:15,230
things but as we look at that

277
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,000
digital generation and the number of

278
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,230
devices connected to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and a</font>

279
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,780
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of applications in that</font>

280
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,610
escalation I think our ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font>

281
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the inner working and how to</font>

282
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,890
commercially make a great experience for

283
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:31,160
our mutual<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers as we have a mixed</font>

284
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,870
world of ipv4 and ipv6 is very very

285
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">critical and there's a whole bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

286
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,450
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the groups are already</font>

287
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,130
working on didn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not draw</font>

288
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,930
attention to those but I thought it

289
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">might be important just to shed a little</font>

290
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,550
light on a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

291
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,640
mind so in the way of conclusions you

292
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,439
know hats off and applause<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the group</font>

293
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,760
here and all of the former and previous

294
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,890
and attendees who weren't able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

295
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">it i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's in my opinion been</font>

296
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,300
extraordinary advancements across the

297
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,580
technology across the service provider

298
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,290
and operator community and not just in

299
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,510
North America but across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the globe and</font>

300
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's attendance here from not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

301
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,210
North America the journey continues of

302
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,230
course and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this rapid innovation</font>

303
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,970
coordination across some of the service

304
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,920
providers and the technology companies

305
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,230
is really important throughout the

306
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,300
entire ecosystem at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day I</font>

307
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we all know understand and</font>

308
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,130
appreciate the fact that this global

309
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,230
infrastructure has to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for everybody</font>

310
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,820
and putting that together in a way where

311
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,420
it can scale is really really important

312
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:32,300
so in closing you know I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

313
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,579
you know ask everybody to take a little

314
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,810
time outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conference but enjoy</font>

especially under these rough economic

320
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,080
times I know that the technology

321
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,280
discussions will be spirited and I

322
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,530
really look forward to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

342
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:48,609
thing is we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying something new at</font>

343
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:50,649
this nanog which is informal box so if

344
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,630

345
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,250

346
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,560
between five and forty other people

347
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss with you there's a</font>

348
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,189
signup board outside I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's closer</font>

349
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,990
to the registration<font color="#CCCCCC"> desk put your diet</font>

350
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,820
idea up there if you would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

351
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,529
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what those ideas are and register</font>

352
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,360
your interest in them go sign your name

353
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:08,890
next to one of them we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

354
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,540
program committee will take the top

355
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,449
three ideas and allocate them rooms

356
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,569
tomorrow so this is sort of a if I could

357
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:19,029
use the overused<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-word crowdsourcing</font>

358
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,279
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crowdsource this it's</font>

359
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be awesome I want it where is</font>

360
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,490
Stacy Hughes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stacy use I wanted to say</font>

361
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,140
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for putting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together the</font>

362
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,550
newcomers breakfast I met some newcomers

363
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,410
and hopefully people who are here for

364
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first time met some people who</font>

365
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,980
aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> here for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time it's a</font>

366
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,540
relatively friendly group and the

367
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,890
largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage of it as the people</font>

368
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,230
who are here so if there's someone you

369
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,699
need to meet just go meet them and if

370
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,290
you can't find them grab any random

371
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:43,029
person and there's a nonzero chance that

372
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,189
they know them<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all I</font>

373
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:47,189
have on administrivia so
