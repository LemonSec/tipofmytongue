1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:13,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is a panel let's talk about</font>

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,509
new data center cooling technologies got

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,669
some subject matter experts up here

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:21,449
Richard Donaldson<font color="#CCCCCC"> from six connects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

of facility engineering at aramark so

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,500
why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talking about this well it's</font>

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,120
all about power if you take the US for

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,790
example two to three percent of all

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,570
power is consumed by data centers

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,250
computing rooms engineering spaces and a

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,309
large percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that power is a</font>

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,079
direct result of cooling needs power

17
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,699
usage and needs continue to grow of

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,890
course so those who understand the

19
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,320
return on investment for reduction of

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,969
that power usage or the slowing of the

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,129
rate of growth are going to have better

22
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,630
margins so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important to all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

23
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,429
us so current technologies we're not

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,810
going to discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> much most people</font>

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,810
understand the basics of perimeter

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,840
you're welcome to talk to any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,130
guys after this presentation but we're

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,509
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip them for the purpose of</font>

31
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:27,089
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about new ones so Richard could</font>

32
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,600
you start by describing what<font color="#CCCCCC"> pua and CD</font>

33
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,600
i er

34
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:42,609
just real quick by show of hands anybody

35
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,049
here Peter<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcie before one okay for the</font>

36
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:45,610
routing group I guess this is sort of an

37
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,049
odd topic on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cooling infrastructure</font>

38
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,729
but peewee very simply is power

39
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:50,109
utilization efficiency it's an industry

40
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">term it's just coming about where we put</font>

41
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:55,030
the ratio of total effective electrical

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,030
power going into a data center over the

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,679
IP load there's a competing metric

44
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,479
called DC<font color="#E5E5E5"> ie that the Department of</font>

45
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:04,179
Energy's pushing that's data center

46
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,469
infrastructure the end of the day we're

47
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:07,119
kind of getting ratio down the committee

48
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:09,340
IT load against the infrastructure mode

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,170
EPA just did a study of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up recently</font>

50
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,700
where they identified it was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

talk about Hughey and pcie useful

67
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,720
metrics that are out there right now so

68
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,480
there's a there's a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">new technologies that we're using that</font>

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,989
we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use today that are</font>

71
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,610
considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly new cooling</font>

72
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,710
technologies and there's also some

73
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,970
bleeding edge cooling technologies that

74
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,350
we will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into if we have time</font>

75
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,420
obviously this is going to press up

76
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,260
against lunch so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the new</font>

77
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,459
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

78
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:19,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">close-coupled cooling technology then</font>

79
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wow haven't acted this is this morning</font>

80
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,610
it hurts some of the topics going on

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,220
inside this is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

82
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,350
topic so so the fact that very few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

83
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,540
you have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pua is not surprising</font>

84
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,989
at all what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really driving this as</font>

85
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,459
Aaron and Richard mentioned as a is

86
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">efficiency and really for three reasons</font>

87
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,959
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is social responsibility</font>

88
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,580
when we talked social responsibility

89
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,100
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree hugging etc</font>

90
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">etcetera Greenpeace etc the greening of</font>

91
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,850
the industry that's not what's really

92
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,100
pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it though that makes for good</font>

93
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,440
marketing etc what's really pushing it

94
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,930
is cost as we increase our efficiency

95
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,000
the cost of the the utility<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use</font>

96
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,800
to power our data centers which is which

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,140
is outrageous for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> our facility</font>

98
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,480
in Miami our monthly power bill is six

99
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,640
hundred and sixty thousand dollars so if

100
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,310
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can if we can improve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our pua by</font>

101
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,260
point one that's close to sixty thousand

102
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,820
dollars a month we're saving and then

103
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,649
the third<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these legacy</font>

104
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,720
data centers are out there have a lot of

105
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,519
stranded space they don't have any more

106
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">power or cooling to give to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,200
so it's stranded there by increasing

108
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">your efficiency you then release</font>

109
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,760
capacity both power and cooling to serve

110
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,080
into that space so how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing it</font>

111
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,479
well the data centers are really looking

112
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,010
at one thing right now to improve their

113
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,440
efficiency and that's managing their

114
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,090
airflow separating that hot<font color="#CCCCCC"> air from</font>

115
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,500
that cold air and there's a lot of

116
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,479
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Aaron mentioned going on</font>

117
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,950
there's hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll cold I'll there's hot</font>

118
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,990
aisle containment cold aisle containment

119
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then something called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close coupled</font>

120
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,040
cooling that's where we take the cooling

121
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,200
element in moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> it move it very close</font>

122
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,970
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source of the heat and legacy</font>

123
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,830
data centers you have perimeter coolers

124
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,960
where you draw your hot air<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the</font>

125
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,550
data center to the perimeter cooler make

126
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,919
it cold push it back under the

127
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,870
luregon that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very long path of that</font>

128
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,240
error follow and it's not very efficient

129
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,860
whereas if you put an inroad cooler

130
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,900
right in your cabinet lineup and you

131
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">suck that hot air right out of the hot</font>

132
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,919
aisle and blow the cold air back into

133
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,110
the cold<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll hear a whole lot more</font>

134
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:18,030
efficient that's all I got to say about

135
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">close-coupled cooling thanks Ben how</font>

136
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,770
about containment and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to talk</font>

137
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">about containment looks like there's</font>

138
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">been a fair amount of publicity around</font>

center servers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO shipping</font>

141
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,230
containers and there are numerous

142
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,080
vendors that have introduced these

143
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,230
products improperly about these trade

145
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,940
this from an energy perspective it's a

146
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,500
fairly simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that is similar to</font>

00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,630
network equipment producing heat and you

152
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,850
are attacking that cooling problem right

153
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,310
at the source that means you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,770
expend less energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move air within</font>

really free but we'll talk about free

207
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,220
cooling there's really two kinds of free

208
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,050
cooling on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market out there there's</font>

209
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,430
air side and water side and even within

210
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,470
air side there's two different kinds

211
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,660
they're not calling it airside free

212
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,670
cooling or economization and fresh air

213
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,080
cooling fresh air cooling is where you

214
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">really take the cold air from the</font>

215
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,969
outside bring it into your data center

216
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,890
untreated and cool your equipment that

217
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,080
causes some problems particulate matter

218
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:34,510
humidity a lot of issues associated with

219
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,890
free air cooling but it's been done and

220
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,390
it works and especially if you've got a

221
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,770
data center that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> overheating your</font>

222
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,569
chillers are down and everything what's

223
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,130
the first thing you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you blow open</font>

224
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">the doors and you use fresh air</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

cooling<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then let the stuff catch</font>

226
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:50,290
fire now real free air side cooling now

227
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,580
you filter it you then heat it up a

228
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,889
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit so you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adjust the</font>

00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,379
humidity and deliver it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

230
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:57,629
or still pretty efficient some problems

231
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,519
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is smoke if you've</font>

233
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,449
your filtration system doesn't take that

00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:05,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">smoke out you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems with your</font>

with your smoke detection your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vesta</font>

236
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:09,509
your fire suppression system etc you

237
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:11,189
want to watch that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

238
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:12,389
we're just now learning about airside

239
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:14,608
free cooling and you never would have

240
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:16,589
thought of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is the pesticides</font>

241
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:17,999
used with crop dusting now you would

242
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,259
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought nobody's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crop-dusting near</font>

243
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,569
me well they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be all that</font>

244
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,459
close and you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need that much but</font>

245
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:25,378
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that pesticide and</font>

246
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,699
there's certain ones get<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto those</font>

247
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,189
printed circuit boards they are

248
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,660
extremely corrosive not quite sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

249
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:32,579
you filter that out or even<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

250
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,160
check to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those problems</font>

251
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,988
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> area so those are airside free</font>

252
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,189
cooling great way to be more efficient

253
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:40,379
because you're not running your chillers

254
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:42,689
as much or at all if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing in</font>

255
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,609
cold air from the outside alternatively

your chill water outside running it

258
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,119
through fan coil units and using that

00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:53,160
cold<font color="#CCCCCC"> water on the outside the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cold</font>

00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:59,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment and bring the chilled water</font>

263
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:00,959
back inside to cool your equipment and

264
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,879
that can be extremely efficient we're

265
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,529
using that in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> culpeper facility and</font>

266
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,839
we also couple that with chill water

267
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:09,059
storage tanks so during the winter we

268
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,679
may be completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our free coolers or</font>

our waterside free coolers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of not using</font>

our chillers at all during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the summer</font>

271
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:16,498
obviously we're up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our chillers we</font>

274
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,829
and at night to use those free those

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,480
free coolers those dry coolers and and

276
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:26,819
then during the day when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes time</font>

277
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,949
to turn on those chillers we will have

start firing up those chillers and start

283

consuming an enormous amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy</font>

284

you're also seeing some this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> dope</font>

brilliant blend anybody want to take on

299
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:15,029
improved crack units what kind of

300
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:29,130
improvements are being made<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crack</font>

301
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:31,470
units a quick question we talked about

302
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:34,199
just briefly about<font color="#CCCCCC"> close-coupled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cooling</font>

303
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,089
that's where you bring a transfer media

304
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:38,370
or any transfer device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and much closer</font>

305
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the load which would be your switches</font>

306
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,800
routers etc quick show hands would if we

307
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about bringing chilled water due</font>

to the cabinet level how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

310
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:58,740
nervous about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright a few one of</font>

311
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:02,399
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be done in this area</font>

312
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:04,259
also is to do a transfer some

313
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,120
methodology with the refrigerant based

314
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:09,149

based refrigerant close to pipes and is

316
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:13,649
converted to a gas it's not obviously

317
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,360
not the same as water because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

sounds feasible or reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

323
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:33,269
that's one that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be talking with the</font>

solutions today our capital intense and

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,029
the paybacks may not be as short as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

334
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,240
thank you the biggest thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say</font>

335
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,459
Robert you're talking about being

336
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,020
expensive that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot if you actually</font>

337
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,400
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get higher densities and you</font>

338
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,350
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> past to where data centers</font>

339
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,329
originally built you got to put in more

340
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,470
coolers in place and to pay for those

341
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,300
you're going to be charged for cooling

342
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,130
premium because it's taking extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> tread</font>

343
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">water deliver that air closer to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

344
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,000
to actually move it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

345
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,620
jack the price on you so you can get it

346
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,990
but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pay for it but yes</font>

347
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,180
the water is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be closer yeah but</font>

348
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,830
go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the days in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the 60s</font>

349
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">and 70s every data center had water</font>

350
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,830
under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> floor everywhere and that's</font>

351
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,870
how it was being delivered<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

352
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,090
big computer super computers were<font color="#E5E5E5"> liquid</font>

353
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">cooled so are we going back to that is</font>

354
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's is that what's going to happen a</font>

355
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,650
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years ago on this panel we</font>

356
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,360
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing spray cool and all</font>

357
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,829
these other things it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> never happened</font>

358
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,350
everybody's just still pushing air

359
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,270
around so yeah maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe eventually</font>

360
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,850
going to reach our limits maybe not but

361
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,230
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the sold out so I think as a</font>

362
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,760
user though I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're</font>

363
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,010
struggling<font color="#E5E5E5"> with is if you're going to</font>

364
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,450
save any money are you passing that

365
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,860
savings on or you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue</font>

366
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> charge more for break or down and the</font>

367
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,380
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still saying well wait a</font>

368
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,579
minute I've got more cooling I've got

369
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,189
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things but I'm not seeing you</font>

370
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,600
passing that efficiency on and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

371
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,670
that's where the you know we're we're

372
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,340
struggling with so instead of New York

373
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,260
for example night bird is offering

374
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,260
rebates so if you can figure out a way

375
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,960
to actually use ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> or used outside air</font>

376
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:20,060
you can get a rebate but I can assure

377
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,410
you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when service provider figures</font>

378
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,560
out how to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that rebate he's not</font>

379
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,120
giving everyone a service credit on your

380
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,920
KW or your brick or damp usage so or

381
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,750
we're trying to put we're trying to push

382
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,750
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> board using that that</font>

383
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,860
savings as a way to fund the capital but

384
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think the customers that they're</font>

385
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,220
struggling with how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many more</font>

386
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,310
break good answer you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna allow</font>

387
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">me to draw so so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking of</font>

388
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:46,099
customers when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're we are interacting</font>

389
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,720
with the prospect how much knowledge do

390
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,490
they have and how much do accrued and

391
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,230
technology's impact your sale at this

392
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,580
point or they still under under educated

393
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:57,430
enough what they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking about</font>

394
00:14:52,580 --> 00:15:01,250
power it really depends on your on the

395
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:03,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">prospect but in primarily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of financial</font>

396
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,760
services we're seeing a much more

397
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,560
sophisticated customer

398
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,550
asking about cooling and processing

399
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,900
clearly when we come<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a group like</font>

400
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,569
this and if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with your</font>

401
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,810
content folks they get it they've either

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many times he's got the he has</font>

405
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:32,689
a tough conversation in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course of a</font>

406
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:36,500
month with a service provider the the so

407
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:38,300
so we we you know telex we're finding

408
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,520
that there is still a subset of

409
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,839
customers that understand that you know

410
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,689
we understand we have to pay for power

411
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,820
we move on because that's not really

412
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,980
what's driving their app there is a

413
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:53,540
larger subset of customers that it comes

414
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:56,810
up every single sales call and you've

415
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:00,349
also got this<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> models right so</font>

416
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,750
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reit model of paper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> KW on</font>

417
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,330
a metered basis people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

418
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,680
drive that to the cabinet level

419
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,970
difficult to get it to the cabinet level

420
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,380
because we just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> build our senators</font>

421
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,320
that way especially the legacy centers

422
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,540
so it's coming back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

423
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,570
question the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cabinet price seems to have</font>

424
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:20,870
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very honest price somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

425
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,880
eighteen eight hundred dollars in a 1200

426
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,830
dollars per cabinet equivalent but you

427
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,960
cannot continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to charge two thousand</font>

428
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,360
to five thousand dollars for your power

429
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get to that cabinet so we're we may</font>

430
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,950

431

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't specifically care how things are</font>

433
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,550
cool just that it's cool enough to not

434
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,990
melt their servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so a Richard</font>

435
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,880
you sit on the board of data center

436
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,790
pulse could you tell us a little bit

437
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,950
about what data center pulse is and and

438
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:52,010
some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learning through</font>

439
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,210

441
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,030

444
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">right we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting there all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font>

445
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,290
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a handful of organizations</font>

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,750
behind it was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> react to not just</font>

461

customers but a pending regulatory

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,460
to start thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about cooling</font>

when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i heard that the other data</font>

483
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,710
sometimes kind of fun but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even these</font>

484
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,200
vendors are competing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the management</font>

485
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,540
of the data center space so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look</font>

486
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,860
at the entire information plant or what

487
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,270
we call the stack your inputs

488
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,189
electricity or outputs or bits and bytes

489
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,480
with you guys control but in the middle

490
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">of all this is this electrical</font>

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,230
consumption and woeful and efficiencies

492
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,150
they're out there and cooling is the

493
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">low-hanging fruit but there are a lot of</font>

other innovations coming along and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

495
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,130
managing the under utilization of the

computing resources that exist within

497
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,420
that environment as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so that's</font>

498
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:49,760
kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work adage their balls</font>

499
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:52,840
sounds pretty cool so Dave maybe believe

500
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,920
it that the air is static and

501
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,750
temperature you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can set it on one</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">temperature data center stays the same</font>

503
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,440
you don't really have to do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

504
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,030
the reality is<font color="#E5E5E5"> air flow is actually</font>

505
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,100
quite flux temperatures are quite flux

506
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,010
and we need some technology to monitor

507
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,770
this kind of data so data centers have

508
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,540
to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sensors and how to react</font>

509
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to changes in air flow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and temperature</font>

510
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,920
can you tell us a bit about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix</font>

511
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,419
is doing to a monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and what</font>

512
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,790
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing with the data if you're</font>

513
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:24,679
making live changes or if it's aggregate

514
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:27,860
data that's useful with 42 data centers

515
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:30,200
around the world with about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years of</font>

516
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,479
operating experience we've developed a

517
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,850
number of methods that we use to capture

518
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,039
operating parameters<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then to</font>

519

optimize the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation center for both</font>

520
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,600
an efficiency perspective but also

521
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:43,789
making sure that every piece of custom

522
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,459
equipment is operating in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an environment</font>

523
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:48,860
that's acceptable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">combination of when we look at the data</font>

525
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,719
center initially we use computational

00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:57,169
fluid dynamics to model that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center</font>

527
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,850
because it is a very once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a data</font>

528
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:02,419
center running let's suppose that all

529
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,340
the customer equipment is at a nominal

530
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:07,039
operating state there's actually very

531
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,350
complex air flows along inside that

532
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,929
environment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can be modeled and</font>

533
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,459
they also can be measured with

534
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:15,230
distributed temperature sensors with

535
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,659
that data you can make adjustments<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

536
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">this environment but as customers make</font>

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:26,740
has changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> significantly you will see</font>

539
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:29,899
some variation so it's a it's a fairly

540
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:32,720
well-developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> methodologies in the</font>

541
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:34,908
industry but I'm not aware of any one

542
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,279
that's taking instead of dynamic

543
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:38,510
coupling between that data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually</font>

changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Opera</font>

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:44,150

out there not aware of any successful

547
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:51,510
implementations might be now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just saw</font>

548
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,660
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of weeks ago some interesting</font>

549
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,490
new power strips that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out</font>

550
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,350
with some sensors built into the strip

551
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,140
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could pull individually on every</font>

552
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,480
cabinet the problem of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the you</font>

553
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,910
know getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of outlets you</font>

554
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,170
need on a strip and and the density you

555
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,690
need in order to get these sensors in

556
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:12,120
there as well we saw a few vendors that

557
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,790
were building some things but they

558
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,159
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite have the density down I</font>

559
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know as soon as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

560
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,710
get over a few hurdles for stuff we'll

561
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,600
start to see more and more of these

562
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,660
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we can actually do</font>

563
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,678
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data as the</font>

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,090
granular data on every single cab in a

566
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,190
data center becomes available of course

567
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:34,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost-effective and we'll add we have one</font>

568
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:38,190
customer big financial who actually

with us than a telephone call orders of

problems looks really<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting come in</font>

573
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,649
again this kind of underscores the point

574
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the concept of</font>

575
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,510
the stack this only illustrates the

576
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,639
coupling of all these district systems

577
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,100
within the data centers that if not

578
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,020
taken as a holistic view you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these</font>

579
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,790
kind of disparate events going on so as

580
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,920
heat rises or heat bubbles move around

581
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,780
in this micro cama climb apology within

582
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,540
the data center it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very complex and</font>

583
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,370
very overtaxed it has reaction

584
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,260
throughout the entire city center on

585
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,790
servers performance and everything else

586
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,230
that's going on so each of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these little</font>

587
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,670
components need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of come together</font>

588
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,679
under one vision and there are some

589
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,520
systems and if Johnson Controls is out

590
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,050
there trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring this together</font>

591
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,580
another couple companies that are trying

592
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,928
to kind of optimize the instrumentation

593
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the data center at a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> physical level</font>

594
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:29,900
but that's a really new kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

595
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,730
yeah sure and one of the other issues

596
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to see a lot is in</font>

597
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:37,100
places that have both facilities and

are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really talking with facilities</font>

601
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:45,740
and there's still protocol issues where

602
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,399
a lot of crack units don't support SNMP

603
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:51,590
or a lot of facility based collection

604
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,720
objects are not designed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with</font>

612
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:10,700
you run facilities and there's also a

613
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:12,530
big IP team engineering team well we're

614
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,120
a little bit different in that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

620
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:27,200
a pretty sophisticated private network

621
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,120
within our facilities that collects all

control itself based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that return air</font>

630
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,790
primitive and in today's power densities

00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,190
the environments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in today you just can't do</font>

633
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,790
that anymore you need to have sensors

634
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:51,380
out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your cold aisles and you have</font>

635
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,090
lots of cold aisles out there and you've

636
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,220
got lots of cooling equipment out there

637
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,919
and you need algorithms that collects

638
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that data opens a valve turns up a</font>

639
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,490
bowl<font color="#E5E5E5"> or turns down a blower and learns</font>

640
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,439
that this is what I need to do to

641
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,000
maintain a certain temperature in this

642
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,620
certain point on the floor and that

643
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,210
certain point on the floor and the

644
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry really isn't quite there yet</font>

645
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:14,179
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they recognize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the need and it is in</font>

646
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,169
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in that direction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

647
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:16,730
so these are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the newer</font>

648
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,679
technologies that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at right</font>

649
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,420
now for cooling now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

650
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the bleeding edge ones I</font>

651
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,600
got a list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't even know what</font>

652
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:27,320
half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things are and someone</font>

653
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,209
tell me what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kyoto cooling is sure</font>

654
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,159
there's a there's a product<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

655
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,640
coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an air site of Commons</font>

656
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight</font>

657
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,680
ization it's a skin meeting for my

658
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,230
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look it up online basically</font>

659
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:42,170
this is a gigantic composite material

660
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:44,750
wheel that takes air as it comes out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

661
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the datacenter that's hot captures atop</font>

662
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,850
the wheels the wheel spins<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually</font>

663
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,890
cools and it returns cool air back so

664
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,750
it's kind of a composite<font color="#CCCCCC"> material that</font>

665
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:56,270
doesn't cooling for you in a very

666
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,160
gigantic sort of honeycomb looking

667
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,990
spinning object outside the data center

668
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,150
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very James Bondish if you want to</font>

669
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,660
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it it's kind of cool literally</font>

670
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,830
so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there a</font>

671
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,020
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> deployments out in mass kinner</font>

672
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,149
employed it yet so they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

673
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,620
to right now but again these are all all

674
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,120
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues are kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to push</font>

675
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,350
the innovation within cooling in fact

676
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that point there's another</font>

677
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,939
company I just found out that as now

678
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,890
attack air conditioning as its main

679
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,390
engineering focus and this is something

680
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking for granted for the</font>

681
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,260
better part of 30 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 some-odd years</font>

682
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,419
and this companies actually innovated

683
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the evaporative process inside of an air</font>

684
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,110
conditioner so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting looks from</font>

685
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,160
most people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of you might</font>

686
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,780
get when you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hours with other</font>

687
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,760
people outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this room but it is</font>

688
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,250
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> an interesting technology that</font>

689
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,210
someone actually go focus on this and

690
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,950
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the types of things that are</font>

691
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,360
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> out within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data and this is</font>

692
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,310
going to migrate towards the smart grid

693
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,600
and smart infrastructure is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

694
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:50,379
innovation that's coming here is going

695
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:55,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to migrate into other industries</font>

696
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:59,720
fantastic how about absorption cooling

697
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:01,850
was to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all right all right</font>

698
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,200
absorption cooling first of all the

699
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,209
thing you need in order to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

700
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,580
absorption cooling is extremely high

701
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,200
temperatures if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a data center</font>

702
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,389
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> facility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's using for example</font>

703
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,490
micro turbines<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check you to generate</font>

704
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,950
the power or for backup power those

705
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:18,500
micro turbines produce an awfully hot

706
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,410
exhaust that hot exhaust can be used in

707
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,150
a process using lithium<font color="#CCCCCC"> bromide solution</font>

708
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,030
called absorption cooling to produce

709
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,740
cooling so so in a facility where are

710
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,720
you using say micro turbines which are

711
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">very expensive much more expensive than</font>

712
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,780
generators suddenly become much more

713
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,490
reasonably expensive if you're not

714
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,260
putting tillers on your facility because

715
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,570
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting your cooling from the hot</font>

716
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,770
exhaust from those micro turbines so

717
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,820
that

718
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:47,800
that's what absorption cooling is been

719
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,780
used to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> commander in the in the Coast</font>

721
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,940
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> turbines because they used</font>

722
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,110
to have them on the Coast Guard

723
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,180
somebody's Coast Guard cutters and

724
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,620
things and we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this and with</font>

725
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,170
that cooling it actually almost became

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,550

729
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,879
real a clear thing to point out with

00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,380
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kyoto cooling system I'm pretty</font>

that the bleeding edge stuff is going to

738
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,050
be you know baby steps because nobody

chiller plants and everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

you buy it can operate over very

uncomfortable they're stuck with an

customers have gone to manufacture did

813
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,720
you say this stuff will run continuously

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,250
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> philippe's Fahrenheit will it do it</font>

just a festive that way and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,870
of your high power density data centers

857
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,390
you don't have 10 12 14 minutes worth of

858
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,129
cooling left within that building to

859
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,990
survive that so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

860
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,610
starting at 85 degrees you're going to

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,470
be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble whereas if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font>

862
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,149
at 65 degrees you've got a little more

00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,800
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to recover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from something like that</font>

865
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,600

866
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:13,190
engineer it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question are coming</font>

up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the microphone yeah Julie egli so I</font>

868
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,340
mean that one of the questions with

869
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,409
running your data center hotter is of

870
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,050
course a you know a higher thermal

871
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:24,560
gradient obviously makes air cooling

872
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:26,120
more efficient you know certainly we

873
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,010
have components and systems today that

874
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,840
we could engineer to run at outlet

875
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:34,820
temperatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's like say 50 c but</font>

886
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,270
when you're talking about having your

00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:11,320
data center temperature go up to 85

888

<font color="#CCCCCC">degrees and pardon me is MTBF on your</font>

889
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:19,950
data center technicians and obviously we

890
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:22,300
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems recruiting and keeping</font>

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,470
intelligent people in those positions to

897
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,160
right direction so you you know the

898
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,010
people who try to monetize that will

899
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,190
almost certainly monetize it at a in

900
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:46,300
their model is a very low number

901
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,010
compared to the actual operational

902

impact that has on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to get</font>

swimming in the cooling fluid with the

Aqualung on but that's just my personal

911
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,460
preference I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to volunteer you can</font>

912
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,800
see I'm wearing a sweater and long pants

913
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,510
because I'm always freezing so anytime

914
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,840
you need me to help you in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80-degree</font>

its data center be glad to help you you

916
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,800
have a future direction doing that

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,370
Brandon they were definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a promotion</font>

of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now so so the other the other</font>

919
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:29,020
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the whole lithium bromide is</font>

920
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:31,030
an absorption cooling medium rather than

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:33,580
traditional ones such as anhydrous

922
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:35,740
ammonia is kind of a new one

923
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,750
I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware that was used for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's necessarily as</font>

of low pressure steam that's still quite

hot is not a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> one on anyone who's</font>

932
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:08,410
been in the petrochemical industry so

933
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,509
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is are we starting to build</font>

934
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:14,859
data centers next to power plants for

935
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:16,480
reasons other than wanting the power and

936
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">i don't mean green power plants either i</font>

937
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,750
need big old nasty coal burners and

938
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,020
nooks where we can actually get steam

939
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:25,630
out anyone want to hike<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can answer</font>

940
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,270
that question as we've looked at

941
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:32,530
cogeneration one of the difficulties is

942
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:35,620
that the uptime where koh gen planet is

943
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,900
94 to ninety-five percent so when it is

944
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">down for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintenance you do need to have</font>

945
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,980
an alternative<font color="#E5E5E5"> source so to do something</font>

949
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,860
don't want to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much in reserve</font>

950
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,500
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could co-locate next to a huge</font>

utility that had multiple cojen plants

952
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,140
etc you would have that level of

boiler to make your own when the utility

956

turbines the capstone turbine array what

960
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,729
was the company we were looking at for

961
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,890
the turbines oh it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a division</font>

962
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,120
of the United technology United

963
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,299
technology so what they were doing was

964
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,770
creating 200 turbines in an array so you

965
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take up to fifteen percent of them</font>

966
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:31,630
offline for maintenance but still our

967
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,190
clients would just be primary power may

968
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,360
be using utilities a backup but the

969
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,370
utility doesn't want to deliver dead

970
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,410
circuits so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have to back that</font>

971
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,759
up so you know and you're you know we're

back up on top of the turbines it's just

976
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:51,149
so much money and you know if you guys

977
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,558
want you know four six eight hundred

just just to add to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great book if</font>

999
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,369
about the power consumption

effectiveness of an entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> datacenter</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of this discussions been</font>

1002
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,680
focused on how do we cool the entire

1004
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,390
more fine-grained efforts being made

1005
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:53,520
both in terms of measuring power

1006
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,690
consumption let's say within a rover

subsection of the data center

1013

1043
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:25,429
and then let's face it we all have

1044
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:27,139
customers or using 10-12 KW we figured

<font color="#E5E5E5">out a way to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it stays cool so</font>

there that we're figuring out a way to

1048
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:36,559
cool so it's commercially available

1049

right now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of different kind of</font>

1055
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:54,190
this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a conversation about the</font>

1056
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:56,109
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and about the systems</font>

1057

engineering approach but one of the

1058
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:59,980
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has struck me for years is</font>

1059
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:02,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is fundamentally about a</font>

1060
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,300
division and a misalignment of interests

1061
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,390
there has always been good technology

1062
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,859
here when you look at why companies like

1063
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,810
the point was<font color="#CCCCCC"> made Google's doing</font>

1064
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:12,130
fascinating really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool stuff amazon</font>

1065
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,380
said why<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1066
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,700
they own the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they get there</font>

1067
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,200
buying the power they built the building

1068
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,700
they picked the rats they bought the

1069
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,220
service they bought the network gear and

1070
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,410
it is in their interest to fix the whole

1071
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,848
thing so it works right almost everyone

1072
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,190
up here is stuck in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unenviable</font>

1073
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:28,960
position of trying to align your

1074
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,390
customers interests in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> interests</font>

1075
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,430
given only the crude tool of pricing and

1076
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,710
marketing right and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I'm</font>

1077
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,200
interested in is is there any way when

1078
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:40,030
blade servers came out nobody thought

1079
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,618
blade servers made any sense and the

1080
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,720
reason blade servers made sense was

1081
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:45,099
because we were all selling space and

1082
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,930
some people like oh well screw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1083
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:48,099
optimize the space I'll just load up on

1084
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,810
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that went on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a little</font>

1085
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:50,980
while and we were all<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh no no no</font>

1086
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start selling</font>

1087
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,300
power plus space or maybe just power or

1088
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:58,060
right we're given these very crude tools

1089
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,800
to adjust our customers behavior and

1090
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,319
what I'm interested in is have any of

1091
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">you come up with more sophisticated more</font>

1092
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,730
clever more effective ways of making

1093
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:09,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that your interests as the designer</font>

1094
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">and finance or and operator of the</font>

1095
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:13,509
building has a shared set of interest

1096
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:16,000
with your customers because right now

1097
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:19,480
it's mostly adversarial and I think the

1098
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">customers are tend to be winning so I'll</font>

1099
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,319
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> back what's up that's a brilliant</font>

1100
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:27,190
question anybody want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stab at</font>

1101
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,779
it I keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the different</font>

1102
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,910
interests unfortunately that's why

00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,589
legislation you know is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Megan there</font>

are bigger entities and looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1105
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:37,089
I will tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that we've seen in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1106
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:39,808
last few years I've seen much greater

1107
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:42,970
interest from customers to do something

1108
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:44,290
and work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us cooperatively and we</font>

1109
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,848
have initiatives going with three or

00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:47,319
four customers right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> or they're</font>

1111
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:49,809
willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bear some pain and</font>

1112
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:51,700
reconfiguring their stuff into a more

1114
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,240
some of these different techniques but

1115
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,530
it really has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a cooperative thing</font>

1116
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,109
where there's a joint interest in doing

1117
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:01,299
it but beyond that I don't know that

going to be a super high density

1141
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:54,578
cabriole 15kw type cabinet is because of

1142
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:57,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">that dislocation between power</font>

1143
00:42:54,579 --> 00:43:00,190
consumption and cooling capacity and

1144
00:42:57,849 --> 00:43:02,950
what the customers willing to pay or

1145
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:05,470
said differently what customers want to

1146
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,359
buy up front so they don't get stuck

1147
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,799
when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need the power</font>

1148
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:13,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they never know what they're</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think most of at some point people</font>

1152
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:23,530
have been stuck in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that situation where</font>

1153
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:28,480
there were a few more amps and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

1154
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:29,579
there and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really annoying also</font>

1155
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,790
jumping<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that you're asking a</font>

1156
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:35,170
phenomenal question that I think program

1157
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:37,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the standpoint of a paradigm shift</font>

1158
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:39,430
we're sort of undergoing that right now

1159
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:41,348
gee I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to is no climate change</font>

1160
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:43,149
in that conversation and that's inspired

1161
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:46,270
a lot of people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go out and trade in</font>

1162
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:47,589
SUV's for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prius now that's more the</font>

1163
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,359
marketing side of raising awareness

1164
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:51,369
having a conversation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pointing out</font>

1165
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">to people that quite frankly the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

1166
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:55,150
largest in my opinion greenhouse gas

1167
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:57,609
emitter if you want to go down that road

1168
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,710
is the IT industry because the metrics

1169
00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:01,150
we're giving just are known data centers

1170
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,500
and quite frankly they really don't know

1171
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:05,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">half the stuff that's out there in</font>

1172
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,390
enterprise facilities at home I couldn't

1173
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:08,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">even find a power slot but Mike laptop</font>

1174
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:10,058
into today so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of power</font>

1175
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:12,220
being consumed just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room alone</font>

1176
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:14,410
so again it's an awareness issue and

1177
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:16,089
customers I think ultimately will begin

1178
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:17,980
to ask for these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll start</font>

1179
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:19,480
seeing energy star ratings on buildings

1180
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,280
and data centers that show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it will</font>

1181
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:25,770
help kind of drive the customer towards

1182
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,770
more energy efficient solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks</font>

1184
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:34,990
data is there been any successful use of

1185
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,400
a combination between what the heat

1186
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:37,569
that's pulled out of the data center to

1187
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,490
heat the rest of the building that may

1188

be occupied<font color="#E5E5E5"> by offices especially in the</font>

00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:52,808
colder climates you do see that but not

1190
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:55,029
Miami don't know why we have a data

1191

center<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't necessarily talk about</font>

1192
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:58,690
yet but it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty</font>

1193
00:44:56,049 --> 00:45:00,940
interesting it's a just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it's a good</font>

1194
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,520
way to deice runways kind of interesting

1195
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:05,170
concept but you know that we lot of

<font color="#CCCCCC">those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things are green band-aids you</font>

1197
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:09,190
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great use of waste heat but</font>

1198
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,930
and you feel efficient for doing it but

1199
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:12,819
it is a band-aid per se<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say you're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's just you know a good way</font>

Miami thank you joel wyman with CHL kind

1203
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:26,650
of more along that lines something

1204
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:28,599
efficient something practical to do with

1205
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:30,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that heat the heat engines or anything</font>

1206
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,440
of the return on that that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1207
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:35,500
think there might be some kind of

1208
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,570
usefulness to put some interest there

1209
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:40,330
you may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always want to be heating</font>

1210
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:43,300
your actual rooms with that kind of heat

1211
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:45,220
but is actually a form of energy you

1212
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:50,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use of it if you can do so</font>

1213
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:52,450
efficiently unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's heat</font>

1214
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:54,100
that you know coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a typical</font>

1215
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,569
server or piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment where</font>

1216
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,310
there's a 20 degree rise let's say

1217
00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:00,580
through that when you start at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 70 it's</font>

1218
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:03,279
90 degree air it's 90 100 110 degree

1219
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Fahrenheit air and it's in large volumes</font>

1220
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,810
it's very hard to efficiently extract

1221
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:10,540
that need and use it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else</font>

1222
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:12,160
in a multi-campus or<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-purpose</font>

1223
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,420
campus you might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some of</font>

1224
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but it's just very difficult when</font>

1225
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:18,940
it's an air now if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are recovering</font>

that heat through a transfer media water

road five or ten years as data center

1234

proliferation continues to get saturated

1235

and you're absolutely nailing it that

1236

there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of lost energy within the</font>

system in that heat I know there's

know turn some turbines with that but
