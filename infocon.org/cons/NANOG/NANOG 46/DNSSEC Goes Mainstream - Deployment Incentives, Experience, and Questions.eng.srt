back in here me my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sister good morning</font>

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,969
folks I will not try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wake those of</font>

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,700
you who are still waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,140
a few things that many of you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font>

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,609
before and a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I'll</font>

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,920
probably put new I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,630
first about what DNS SEC actually is why

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,000
it's not been more widely deployed to

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,049
date and what you know now that it's

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,559
actually appearing out in the

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:42,450
operational world because there have

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:45,569
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of history that's gone into</font>

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,770
where we're at today a horrifying amount

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,390
of history I see some colleagues out

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,210
here in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have actually been</font>

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,350
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this longer than I have and</font>

00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:58,020
will get more get back to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

at the background what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> janecek all it</font>

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,059
does it adds authentication to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,360

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,650
it eschews you that the data that you

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,830
got from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS is what whoever</font>

27
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,810
controls the zone wanted you to get

28
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,110
that's all it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does does not hide</font>

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,150
although i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's significant</font>

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,330
benefit in being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the</font>

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,220
answer if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can validate it regardless</font>

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,619
of where it came from so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's</font>

35

some intrinsic protection for servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

that but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the primary purpose</font>

authenticate the data the problem that

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,619
does what problem does DNS SEC really

40
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,759
solve as many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew him know there</font>

41
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,220
have been doing operations for a long

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,710
time dns is a very old protocol and

43
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,240
internet terms it was written for a

44
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,079
different world<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in today's</font>

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,570
environment its virtues of simplicity

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,750
and low overhead can leave the protocol

47
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,279
wide open to abuse the base DNS SEC

48
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,759
protocol will believe pretty much

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,500
anything from pretty much anybody once

50
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,849
it's believed a bad answer a resolver

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
will keep repeating it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to anybody who</font>

52
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,200
asks

53

we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot to make Dennis more</font>

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,619
resilient over the years a little bit

less Richard a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit less trusting</font>

56
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,440
but the underlying issue remains it's

57
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,890
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Deanna's lie to</font>

58

people

59
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:39,910
this is a serious<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem and yet we've</font>

60
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:42,760
had a hierarchy of problems for such a

61
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,660
long time that it's not been cleared

62
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,690
this is something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are terribly</font>

63
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,100
worried about because attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS is</font>

64
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,280
simple but attacking other things has

65
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:54,130
been even simpler we've got social

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering attacks on users we've got</font>

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,910
worms and viruses reverting machines

68
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,299
we've got it attacks on networks and

69
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,420
network elements so for a long time this

70
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,830
was not making anybody's hit parade of

71
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:12,730
things that keep administrators awake at

72
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:14,680
three in the morning so there we were

73
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:19,959
the current set of DNS SEC standards

74
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:23,680
came out in 2004 RFC's 403<font color="#E5E5E5"> 34 34 and 40</font>

used<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source name servers also</font>

77
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,370
appeared in 2004 and we waited there was

78
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,110
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> like tossing a rock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down a well</font>

79
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:37,690
with no idea how long the wait for the

80
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:42,430
splash DNS SEC obviously incurred some

81
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:45,250
costs bandwidth cycles clue adding new

82
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,480
capability always does and we knew at

83
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,070
the time that the benefits weren't

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,238
obviously cost effective for anyone

85
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:53,620
there's a well-known economic analysis

86
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,220
that actually applies to multiple

87
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,690
technologies that basically says the

88
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:05,079
deploying technology that's good for you

89
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:07,690
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't enough of an incentive we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation again I mean many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

know we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> this conversation before</font>

97
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,740
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part of the story that I think</font>

98
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,550
everybody knows so it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quick or at</font>

99
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,940

because all of a sudden it's easy and

00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:57,719
now we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out if Danis tech is</font>

107

we're still involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in we're still</font>

329
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:21,180
evolving the best practices on that

330
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,850
there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question of how you</font>

331
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,400
publish your your public keys for a sign

332
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,100
zone if your parent isn't signed because

333
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,130
the protocol assumes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there'll be a</font>

334
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,890
chain of trust a hierarchy that follows

335
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,100
the namespace there are several possible

336
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,959
ways around that and

337
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that separately but</font>

338
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:42,310
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really room here to go into</font>

339
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in detail there's another class of</font>

340
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:47,380
issues around the fact that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> so hard</font>

341
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:50,199
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to pay for security even</font>

342
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:53,980
though cache poisoning is cheap risk

343
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:56,560
mitigation is comparatively expensive so

344
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,380
it's not clear where it fits for other

345
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:04,029
providers of services around DNS for

346
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:06,189
registrar's and hosting providers and

347
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:10,000
others who can't afford to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give away</font>

348
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:12,009
more work so what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> would some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

349
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,610
how the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is going to play</font>

350
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:19,720
out is very interesting so kind of to

351
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,829
conclude I remain optimistic we're

352
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,720
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some pretty complex</font>

353
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:26,469
technology but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does solve a problem</font>

354
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,680
we have at what looks like manageable

355
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:32,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost and I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe we'll find that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

356
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,859
more trustworthy<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS will enable some</font>

357
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:37,149
things so we just don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> see yet</font>

358
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,190
because we take so much for granted we

359
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:43,300
act as if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS is trustworthy today</font>

360
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:44,800
it's not and when we do have

361
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,269
infrastructure that's slightly more

362
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,089
trustworthy I think there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

363
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:52,899
things that will become feasible that

364
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:54,639
haven't been yet so I guess the takeaway

365
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:57,519
here is if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been waiting for DNS</font>

366
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,310
active you real please consider that the

367
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,639
time is now if you managed DNS zones

368
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:06,280
look into signing them look into what

369
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,919
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets you and what it costs you if</font>

370
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,289
you're on resolvers particularly large

371
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,539
resolvers look at what will happen when

372
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:18,929
you're receiving<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign data what you're</font>

373
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:18,929
relying on what your customers need and

374
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll ask real quick I know some of</font>

375
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,490
talked to some of the folks out here who

376
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,270
are who have been experimenting with the

377
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:32,550
NSF who have done some work recently

378

<font color="#CCCCCC">working on org so I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a lot</font>

382
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,620
of hands but seek each other out and

383
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,090
there are folks in the room who have

384
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,179
some operational experience and some

385
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,520
testing testing experience and so on

386
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:00,330
there was also a symposium in Washington

387
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,310
last week on some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues around</font>

388
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,899
signing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what happens next</font>

389
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,889
because we've been focused on that for

390
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,470
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> long that there are some issues that</font>

391
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:11,040
need to be discussed once we can assume

392
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,960
assigned route so the results for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shortly stay tuned for that</font>

396
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,920
hope we'll be seeing some early adopters

397
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,410
sharing a lot of experience now and then

398
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:30,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the pretty near future so especially</font>

399
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:34,220
if we ask them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so questions comments</font>

411

not directly and I would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

412

certainly firewalls that have been

00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,250
deployed recently enough that they're

445

make along along those lines one is that

469
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:16,790
there has actually been some empirical

470
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,049
research done and I should just add the

471
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,330
reference on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pack online so</font>

472
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:25,918
people can<font color="#CCCCCC"> find it but there was a study</font>

473
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:28,559
done by nominate and core competence I

474
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,740
guess that looked at a bunch of small

475
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,600
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Soho devices and mostly they</font>

476
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,120
found that you can get the right

477
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,850
behavior out of the boxes but not by

478
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:44,070
default which I did sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into a</font>

479
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit the other the other piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

480
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,010
the picture though is I think the

481
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,110
takeaway different implementations

482
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,650
behave differently with with respect to

always what's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the field and</font>

487
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,409
how it actually behaves is something you

488
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to go look at what's happening in</font>

489
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:10,320
your network and the flag I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

490
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,179
raise here is even if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

491
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,580
understand how simple dns is in your

492
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,960
network today it might still be

493
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you need to look carefully at</font>

494
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,380
how is it going to behave when the world

495
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,379
changes around you

496
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:28,770
hey Rob lost on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISC just to the question</font>

about path empty earlier path them to

you is largely irrelevant for UDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> base</font>

there was the there is a study that I

516
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,720
what I refer to as the early deployment

517
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,710
experience and why I'm happy to see some

518
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,230
folks in here that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know have been</font>

519
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,550
experimenting because that's the kind of

520
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:26,160
thing that is actually very current

521
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,870
right now the people are looking at in

522
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,720
detail at what the behavior will turn

out to be I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess it's I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

the question of having looked at how

many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people this will break is it's a</font>

528
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,580
little bit because there's there's

529
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,530
multiple pieces of that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

530
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,300
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of active study and</font>

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,030
discussion going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so somebody is</font>

00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,470
actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at yes forget changing</font>

00:24:53,470 --> 00:25:00,520
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people drop off the map if you</font>

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,039
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS set on with an answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

536
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,908
going to be approaching for<font color="#CCCCCC"> kbytes what</font>

537
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:10,350
happens right but if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> could get</font>

538
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:10,350
asking for what's this item

00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:17,529
behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> us off enemies</font>

540
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:30,110
Rob ya or behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the firewall ok so the</font>

541
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,730
discussion between the yoga Igor and me

542
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,158
was hopefully they know what they're

543
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,169
asking for they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking for it and</font>

544
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,780
Igor's response was behind the firewall

545
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:41,870
and I said yes well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corner</font>

546
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:45,370
case right so if you would know how many

547
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,370
how much before it is

548
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:56,629
so the DNS SEC discussion is usually not

00:25:53,770 --> 00:26:05,930
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resolve</font>

might have some data yeah so chris

griffiths comcast so one of the things

556
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,830
that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been looking at specifically</font>

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">rape Ellis from nomina published this</font>

558
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:27,290
article<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Suzanne was talking about it</font>

559
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:29,840
was for testing or home gateway sofa

560
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:33,710
routers and he's also got an active

561
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,409
draft that's been open for specifically

562
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:40,310
DNS proxies and best practices in that

563

arena for getting traffic and dealing

564
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:46,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">with large DNS query sizes so something</font>

565
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:51,310
that folks should definitely look into

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:51,310
and also in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the supporting</font>

567
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:04,290
but we've also we've also got our own

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:06,780
testing and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is it Chris if you</font>

00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:09,060
don't mind my<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking I'm hoping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:15,780
to publish and share some that

assured that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> publishing</font>

584
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,189
recent discussion one is that in terms

585
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,010
of things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hathon to use discovery</font>

586
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,540
or the overall size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the packet</font>

587
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,010
obviously path MTU discovery is not very

588
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">relevant because you actually end up</font>

589
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,500
with

590
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,210
UDP packets so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a question</font>

591
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,400
of whether your firewall understands the

592
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,110
DNS packets are larger than 512 bytes

593
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,520
it's a question of whether your fire

594
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,620
walk with deal with fragmented EVP

595
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,270
packets and reassemble them<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even</font>

599
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">barbel so there's a lot of stuff that</font>

600
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes wrong the firewall side of it the</font>

601
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,370
other issue is with regards to you know

602
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,630
what breaks when you turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on usually</font>

603
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,340
people know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break</font>

604
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,530
because they're turning<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on on their</font>

605
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,209
resolver on their caching resolvers for

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:33,299
different on validation sort of setting

607
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:37,200
the obits and gets that big answer

608
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:39,059
signs Putin they<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop working usually if</font>

609
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have it if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't understand i'm</font>

610
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:42,779
turning on something big i'm going to

611
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:43,889
test it and then it stops working you're

612
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,570
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out pretty quickly the</font>

613
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,399
best what's going to happen so it's not

614
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's somewhere out there</font>

615
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:52,139
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start happening and all of</font>

616
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:53,759
a sudden things won't work hopefully the

617
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:55,350
people who are implementing will be able

618
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure out and get immediate feedback</font>

619
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,889
as to what was working<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not and this</font>

620
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:00,929
is the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has changed in the</font>

last few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over the last year</font>

623
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,879
effort before that which is that we're

00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,439
getting operational experience people

625
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:16,709
actually getting out and doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

626
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:19,259
looking at the results I'm really

634
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:39,659
psych spider right yes that wasn't what

00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:41,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was thinking of but that's another</font>

636
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,720
good one to have and I'm realizing that

637
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,399
what i wrote what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really missing</font>

638
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,960
here is a bibliography slide that I can

639
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,789
I think ask the merit folks to add to

640
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,830
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation online yeah so just</font>

641
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:53,039
say so people can<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember it back</font>

645
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:06,600
not seeing anybody else moving and I

646
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:13,619
think the time slots up so Paul and Rob

647
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:17,459
Rob gets the last word and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font>

648
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:19,759
figure it out guys you were the my first

649
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,759
go ahead

650
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:27,290
my final thought on the validation as

651
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody who lose to invalidate</font>

652
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,340
the

653
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,340
beautiful work

654
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:38,090
this is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to see the true</font>

655
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:40,940
impact things screwed<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough quality</font>

656
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:43,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">still difficult to do validation by</font>

657
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:47,420
difficult by<font color="#E5E5E5"> being made</font>

658
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:52,429
to make sure your your height our list

659
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:55,279
is updated on frequent basis the dlp is

660
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:57,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the kind of the driving a Model</font>

T versus driving something with that

663
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:08,500
it becomes with a sign route Oh load<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

665
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,460
it's all automatic from there right it's

666
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,860
all automatic and it's all automatic

667
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,090
breakage because some software vendor

668
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,679
somewhere is going to push out an update

669
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:22,750
it's all going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in their</font>

advancement at all wheels which is why

671
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:28,570
it's really important that we understand

672
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:31,510
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing long before them so as</font>

676
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:41,770
proved to be a disastrously bad idea

dld is working in an unexpected way and

691
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:32,750
that is I guess I should have expected
