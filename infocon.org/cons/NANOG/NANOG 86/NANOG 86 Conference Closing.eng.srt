00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,899
my friends

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,179
thank you for being here for the closing

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,620
so

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,599
and thinking about nanog we kind of

8
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,460
unders I kind of understand nanog as

9
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,320
existing at the intersection between

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,539
community and purpose

11
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,340
and we all know the well we might know

12
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,260
the stats about Community we know that

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,279
people who are involved in their

14
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,560
communities have lower rates of stress

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,400
anxiety and depression and people who

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,980
um and they have also have higher rates

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,079
of

18
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,219
self-satisfying life

19
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,260
and happiness

20
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,780
a study was done where over a nine year

21
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,820
period those who had closer social

22
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,379
connections were two to three times less

23
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,059
likely to die

24
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,219
and we do know that there are many kinds

25
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,899
of communities there's a kind of

26
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,460
community you know where you have your

27
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,399
close family uh a little bit larger and

28
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,440
our regional local communities and

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,180
something wide-ranging like we have here

30
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,000
at com at nanog

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
and it takes all of these to produce a

32
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,379
life that is self-satisfying and

33
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,860
supporting

34
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,540
so on the other side and and with

35
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,400
purpose not only on the other side of it

36
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,380
we all know that having purpose is

37
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,540
essential to having a happy life

38
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,520
uh it's basically our Guiding Light

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,080
tells us which direction we want to go

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,640
and for those of us here in this room

41
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,320
and who are you know going to be

42
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,939
watching later a lot of us are involved

43
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,040
in the purpose of building the global

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,700
internet which arguably I in my opinion

45
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,220
is one of the greatest achievements that

46
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
we have achieved as mankind so I think

47
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,960
that we should be proud of that that's

48
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,360
something that everybody here knows that

49
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,560
you're involved in and that we're doing

50
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,020
and in my opinion they're

51
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,880
you know it's it's pretty good for a

52
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,360
purpose anyway

53
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,000
so here's who we have to thank who put

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
us in the neighborhood that we could all

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,240

56
