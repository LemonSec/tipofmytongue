[Music]

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,799
let's continue our program and next up

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,219
I'd like to introduce Yosh wandera who

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,559
will be presenting automating your

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,500
circuit maintenance notifications just

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,900
is a managing consultant that Network

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,100
the core

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,859
sorry Network to code and travel from

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,740
Minneapolis to join us today this is the

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,599
first time this is the first time Jose

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,580
is presenting at nalak

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,679
and it's a pleasure to have him here to

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,940
speak with us today

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,180
welcome Jose to Stage is yours thank you

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,500
so first off we want to thank the folks

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,180
at nanog for having this in beautiful

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,040
California as he mentioned Minneapolis

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,559
is where I call home my wife told me it

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,899
was 23 degrees in the morning yesterday

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,539
morning minus five Celsius you know so

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,239
I'm grateful to be here

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,680
so

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,120
um here to talk about circuit

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,559
maintenances and how do we look at

27
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,019
automating them and that's a a big part

28
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,180
of

29
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,340
everybody's environment that has a Wham

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,380
so first off a quick introduction why

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,780
I'm here why why do what gives me some

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,000
credibility to come talk here

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,619
um I'm a Management Consultant at

34
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,600
networked code I've been involved in

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,759
network automation really continuously

36
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,680
for the past three years in my time at

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,880
NTC

38
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,159
but really start diving into automain

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,960
networks seven years ago so before that

40
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,080
I worked in the retail environment and

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,540
Retail very large retail having to do

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,360
things on scale before automation just

43
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,619
doing a lot with cookie cutter

44
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,720
environments

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,460
um so I've been doing networking for

46
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,960
over 20 years now

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,240
um and then I've also an author of The

48
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,799
Open Source Network management book that

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,380
you can out there

50
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,540
so the agenda I want to talk about what

51
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,759
the problem is how do we look at

52
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,040
automating the maintenances and make

53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,500
your life better better

54
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,479
we'll go into a demo and then we'll talk

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,799
about the libraries that were used

56
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,500
within this and I do want to call out

57
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,240
everything here that will be talked

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,580
about is open source so there's nothing

59
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,979
proprietary nothing about it that you

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,140
have to pay money other than just a

61
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,420
little bit of time investment to use the

62
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,700
open source

63
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,340
so the the current process for circuit

64
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,660
maintenances from an Enterprise

65
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,580
perspective this is just a

66
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,620
generalization it may not apply directly

67
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,700
to you you might have some better

68
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,760
processes than this but it's kind of

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,099
what's been out there

70
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,680
so it's very manual oftentimes up on the

71
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,540
upper left we've got the provider it's

72
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,860
in blue

73
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,840
um that says okay we need to take

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,640
maintenance on our circuit and then

75
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,959
we're going to go ahead and schedule

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,760
that circuit maintenance we'll send an

77
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,739
email to all the people that are

78
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,519
impacted and then in Gray over a very

79
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,319
manual process no nothing with

80
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,840
automation the email comes in it sits in

81
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,720
the inbox it's sitting there maybe

82
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,760
there's some searches in the inbox to

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,000
see your your primary or the important

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,560
circuits if they're going to be taking a

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,599
maintenance you want to be aware of that

86
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,760
but they just sit there

87
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,959
as it goes then you there's a it comes

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,879
to the day of the events the knock gets

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,980
a notification that hey this interface

90
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,260
went down they may go and look at these

91
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,180
circuits and say yep there was a circuit

92
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,640
maintenance or worse yet you get paged

93
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,900
so just a few of the risks that go along

94
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,280
with the things in a manual setup we all

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,780
designed the wands if you have a

96
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,940
multi-carrier environment to be able to

97
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,800
withstand a circuit maintenance or a

98
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,220
circuit outage so you very well could be

99
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,900
that you're as you go through the

100
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,959
circuit or your day that hey both

101
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,640
carriers decide to do circuit

102
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,319
maintenance at the same time

103
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,720
very large geography that's likely to

104
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,860
happen

105
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,500
if you have service users in the middle

106
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,000
of the night working in those buildings

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,860
where the typical maintenances happen

108
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,780
you need to communicate that that's

109
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,760
about good business sense about how do

110
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,680
we know that the services are going to

111
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,000
be available

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,060
maybe you get unnecessary uh on-call

113
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,980
page that's a quality of life I know I

114
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,239
don't like being woken up in the middle

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,580
of night even though with kids at home

116
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,279
they make wake me up enough but you know

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,019
let's not go ahead and call me because

118
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,399
there's a Planned

119
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,440
maintenance going on

120
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,080
and then reporting inaccuracies we we're

121
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,300
all judged on from a Wan perspective of

122
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,880
what that uptime looks like and be able

123
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,560
to provide services to the End customer

124
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,900
at those sites so we won't be able to

125
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,880
report on that and if it's planned that

126
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,840
shouldn't count against you

127
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,780
so there has to be a better way so this

128
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,880
is looking at taking a look at what we

129
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,919
can do with automation with these types

130
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,800
of things and again all open source it's

131
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,220
out there available today

132
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,540
um so we're going to talk about the net

133
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,699
not about circuit maintenance plug-in so

134
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,979
this is a plug-in that is built to

135
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,419
manage maintenance notifications from

136
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,060
circuit providers

137
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,520
within this there's a library that's a

138
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,220
python a python Library that's a circuit

139
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,320
maintenance parser Library so we are

140
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,479
looking at doing parsers

141
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,340
and through this process that we'll see

142
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,500
that will create objects that can be

143
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,419
accessed via apis inside of your

144
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,380
environment

145
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,919
that's both rest apis and graphql

146
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,900
endpoints and then look at past and

147
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,940
future maintenances that are going on so

148
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,039
be able to say okay what are maintenance

149
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,720
is coming up in the future in the next

150
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,180
seven days 30 days that we can start to

151
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,360
plan for or if we need to report on it

152
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,360
you can take a look at these in a since

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,699
they're in that data format you can work

154
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,100
with that and then also you can take

155
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,199
action so go ahead and put these

156
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,539
circuits all the monitoring involved

157
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,039
with the circuits into maintenance mode

158
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,080
so that way you don't get called when

159
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,419
the automated the event happens and it

160
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,180
goes down

161
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,160
and then lastly here we're going to show

162
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,660
how we can actually check to see if

163
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,240
there's any overlapping maintenance that

164
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,160
goes on that with your dual carrier

165
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,080
environments that you're able to say all

166
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,280
right there's going to be a complete

167
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,139
outage you can take action to call the

168
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,180
Carrier and say hey can you move your

169
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,860
maintenance that way the site doesn't

170
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,680
take an outage or at least notify the

171
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,660
end users of that

172
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,900
and last call out here this was all

173
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,220
started by Christian Adele and part of a

174
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,780
hackathon at NTC

175
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,280
so what that looks like from a solution

176
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,160
in an automated perspective the top left

177
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,560
is still the same it's all blue could be

178
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,080
automated I don't have enough purview on

179
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
the circuit carriers to say hey are they

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,280
automating this environment

181
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,419
but now

182
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,460
on the right side that your customer

183
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,039
environment is all automated so it's

184
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,319
moved from a grade to having a color of

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,300
orange in there we'll get that email

186
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,280
that will come in so we're still using

187
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,680
that same email notification process

188
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,500
those will be parsed and then created

189
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,020
have not about objects created that can

190
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,639
be used so from there then the not about

191
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
job will go ahead and search through all

192
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,960
those maintenances we know about what

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,180
site each circuit goes to and then

194
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,340
you're able to go ahead and say all

195
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,139
right we need to take action on that

196
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,180
particular site

197
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,940
beyond that what's coming soon is not

198
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,160
about has a feature called jobs we're

199
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,139
going to look to enable you to set your

200
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,300
business process inside of a not about

201
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,340
job that will then be able as your

202
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,380
business process if that's a senate

203
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,460
communication or to set the interface on

204
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,039
the device and monitoring into

205
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,900
maintenance mode so that way it's all

206
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,639
set for you

207
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,699
and then as well with this we have the

208
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,680
capability to have the state of the

209
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,720
maintenances be exposed via Prometheus

210
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,440
metrics so this by having that in a

211
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,599
matrix format you're able to scrape that

212
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,039
and be able to get that into your

213
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,180
monitoring platforms

214
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,960
so how are we doing this the first and

215
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,880
the best way that we can work with

216
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,460
emails is a maintenance notification

217
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,259
standard that was proposed that nanog

218
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,759
60.

219
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,360
um it was really the idea around

220
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,419
providing headers and using iCal to just

221
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,580
accompany the emails that are coming in

222
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,740
and then from those headers we can parse

223
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,960
the data very quickly without having to

224
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,599
do regex parsing and put these into

225
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,640
those objects

226
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,200
and so that's a pretty quick and easy

227
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
way for the providers to get to provide

228
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,940
value back to the Enterprise as they

229
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,300
serve

230
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,399
so today in the network to code library

231
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,040
that is available we've got support

232
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,980
specific support for EU networks NTT

233
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,920
packet fabric to Leia and Telstra and

234
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,440
there's a generic b cop provider around

235
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,380
that particular

236
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,060
proposal so if they just support it

237
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,100
without anything else any additional

238
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,040
headers we've got that all set to go

239
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,839
I'm not going to read everything on the

240
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,100
right of all the carriers that we

241
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,399
support via an actual text parser but

242
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,019
they're they're out there we do support

243
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,480
if they don't want to be adding the

244
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,519
headers for us that we can go ahead and

245
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,779
still parse that information

246
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,720
so what if my provider does not support

247
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,680
B cop today in the standard well we look

248
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,080
at setup email parsing this isn't

249
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,660
necessarily ideal because emails we all

250
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,700
know emails are just text and they can

251
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,480
change

252
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,060
we rely heavily on the fact that these

253
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,399
are need to remain consistent and that

254
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,740
we can then parse that and get the data

255
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,360
get your circuit ID get the start time

256
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,700
get the end time and be able to put that

257
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,519
into an object

258
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,860
our ideal State though um that I think

259
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,500
we'll hear out there you'll hear from

260
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,779
anybody within automation is being able

261
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,540
to work with apis if we can get an API

262
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,000
access from the provider that says here

263
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,880
is all the maintenances coming up that

264
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,700
is terrific

265
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,500
um we have another library that we have

266
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,620
called diffsync it's a python library

267
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,500
that takes just things from system a

268
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,200
system B and can sync those either one

269
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
way into or between the two and so we

270
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,660
would look at doing something with those

271
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,360
apis be able to pull these in as objects

272
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,279
but we're not seeing that as commonplace

273
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,100
today there's a cost that is involved

274
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,320
with providing the API endpoint

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,560
maintaining that API endpoint and just

276
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,500
have being able to keep it there

277
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,800
available consistently

278
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,579
so I've got a demo that I'm going to

279
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,660
share

280
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,120
um we'll jump through here in just a

281
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,740
short bit going throughout what we're

282
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,200
going to cover in this so first I'm

283
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,700
going to go into a few things within

284
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,800
notabot that are part of the not about

285
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
core project and how circuits and

286
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,019
providers look within this Pro this

287
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,720
platform but then we'll dig into the

288
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,079
exact go through email retrieving the

289
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,420
emails parsing those emails and then

290
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,600
looking for those overlaps

291
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,060
so as we go we've got our circuits we'll

292
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,800
go to the provider page

293
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,720
so on this page with the providers you

294
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,760
can see all the providers you have and

295
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,560
then their ASN number the account number

296
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,600
and the number of circuits

297
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,140
from there going into the detail page we

298
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,760
have that ASN number again the account

299
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,339
number the portal link that can be

300
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,800
documented and the contacts for it and

301
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,720
we see that there's 46 circuits for this

302
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,100
particular setup

303
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,440
so here are all then all the circuits

304
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,839
that we have going through

305
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,579
and then we'll take a look at what a

306
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,380
circuit detail looks like

307
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,779
first we have our status the provider

308
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,060
the circuit ID obviously the things in

309
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,860
blue you can click and move around on

310
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,600
and then on the right side we've got our

311
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,700
terminations so we have our a side where

312
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,040
it's going the Z side going into uh

313
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,140
provider but right now we have no

314
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,060
circuit notifications because there

315
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,540
hasn't been anything ingested yet

316
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,180
so as part of the not about jobs uh

317
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,620
we'll get back to the finding sites with

318
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,300
overlap but we'll go first into the

319
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,060
update circuit maintenances

320
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,760
here we're taken to a page where we can

321
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,800
execute one time or we can set this up

322
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,260
in a cron like every hour every day

323
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,360
every

324
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,019
multiple setups there

325
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,180
so as this job runs it this particular

326
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,980
one took about 10 seconds to execute

327
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,040
it's going through and check reading an

328
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,579
IMAP inbox on Gmail we support both IMAP

329
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,019
and Gmail today

330
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,079
and then it ingests all the data

331
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,360
so from there we can now go back to that

332
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,339
circuit detail and we can see that

333
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,720
there's a circuit maintenance upcoming

334
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,880
for in the next several days here

335
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,980
so we go into that maintenance and now

336
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,660
we have some more details we have the

337
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,820
description we have the status of it if

338
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,260
it's confirmed we have an acknowledgment

339
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,360
field as well but then we also have all

340
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,760
the circuits so your notifications will

341
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,860
come with multiple circuits it will list

342
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,660
that within the notification of what's

343
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,139
all there

344
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,839
from there we'll go ahead and edit and

345
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,700
we have the acknowledgment field set way

346
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,440
through your process you can acknowledge

347
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,019
these circuits and just document hey

348
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,820
someone is aware of this maintenance

349
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,880
upcoming and then we have that be able

350
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,579
to be put on this page you can also Mass

351
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,560
edit all these so we'll just go ahead

352
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,839
and put these all into an acknowledge

353
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,000
State and now we have the check box on

354
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,600
the left that instead of the X

355
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,660
along with this we have a dashboard this

356
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,339
is a configurable circuits with

357
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:48,899
maintenances in the next 30 days seven

358
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,360
days whatever that's configured to and

359
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
then devices since the circus connected

360
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,860
devices in Autobot we can say what

361
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,060
devices are going to be having that

362
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,100
maintenance and then some metrics as

363
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,680
well about just the average duration the

364
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,980
future maintenances and other pieces of

365
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,139
data we'd love to expand that as well if

366
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,519
you have a metric you'd love to see

367
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,560
we'll put that in

368
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,200
so now getting into the job with finding

369
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,779
sites with maintenance overlap

370
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,060
we'll come in and we'll run this one

371
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,459
time I have the same options can run

372
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,200
this repeatedly

373
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,240
but now just sort sort through all those

374
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,220
records and check to see if there was

375
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,620
any kind of overlap we should show an

376
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,579
overlap at LAX that LAX one two both

377
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,620
have overlapping maintenance from its

378
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,779
primary and secondary carrier and then

379
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,180
we go all the way through and finally we

380
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,579
have a log that tells us exactly how

381
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,740
many maintenance notifications we've

382
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,180
parsed through and this is only

383
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,980
forward-looking we're not looking to add

384
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,639
things in the past

385
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,720
foreign

386
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,880
so a few of the libraries that we

387
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,279
leverage here

388
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,040
first is the circuit maintenance Plugin

389
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,480
or the sake sorry circuit maintenance

390
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,199
parser this is a parsing Library it's uh

391
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,600
pure python you we've you can put this

392
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,399
into your own environment with or

393
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,240
without this plugin so we're looking to

394
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,360
continue to enhance this Library if

395
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,459
there's a library or if there's a

396
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,440
carrier that does not support or we

397
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,699
don't have support for this and you want

398
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,040
to use it we very much welcome either

399
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,320
issues on GitHub that say hey here's a

400
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,579
maintenance notification from this

401
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,639
provider can you make a parser for this

402
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,920
or if you want to provide the feedback

403
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,800
of hey this is the parser how it looks

404
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
go ahead and open a pull requests and

405
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,420
contribute back we very much will help

406
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,779
you through the process as well so

407
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,699
take a look there

408
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,180
and then what's shown here is the not

409
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,339
about plug-in circuit maintenance so the

410
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,019
QR code will take you to that page

411
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,519
specifically

412
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,220
to be able to go through and get

413
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,019
everything installed that we walk

414
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,160
through here

415
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,959
and then the link to not about itself

416
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,599
the source of Truth database

417
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,880
excuse me

418
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,699
so what can you do this is also what I'm

419
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,579
here to call to action can you help the

420
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:15,959
community

421
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,839
so first and foremost ask your provider

422
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,820
can they support create an API endpoint

423
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,519
that we can then go ahead and start to

424
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,800
create a connection from that API

425
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,800
endpoint and ingest that into into these

426
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,500
databases or your own databases having

427
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,300
that endpoint we're going to be able to

428
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,540
do a lot more with that

429
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,820
if they don't support the idea of having

430
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,160
an API which there's some costs involved

431
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,220
with that then ask them to add the the

432
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,639
iCal proposal of adding headers into the

433
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,980
their emails when I was going through

434
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,199
setting up this demo sign up a python

435
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,360
script to send emails adding the header

436
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,199
was very quick so I would imagine

437
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,339
hopefully they're automated their side

438
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,040
on the carrier side can you just add

439
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,199
headers that come into the inbox it

440
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,059
won't change the behavior of the inbox

441
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,059
today but we'll be able to get some much

442
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,000
more Rich detail there

443
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,240
and then lastly if you have a provider

444
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,880
that's not listed on the supported list

445
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,599
today Bring It On in let's see what

446
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,040
their maintenance notifications look

447
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,780
like hopefully it's a template a

448
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,160
one-time thing

449
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,500
and then we can write the parsers that

450
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,600
can be there and share that amongst the

451
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,360
community so not everyone has to do

452
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,979
everything for every carrier

453
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,260
so with that we've got some questions or

454
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,440
foreign

455
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,799
awesome

456
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,080
foreign

457
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,679
hi I'm Michael Costello Drive nuts uh so

458
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,360
you were mentioning the uh the

459
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,460
maintenance notification best current uh

460
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,799
operational practices work uh as I

461
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:41,640
understand it that group uh as the last

462
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,160
time I heard I think it was 2020 uh they

463
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,660
were trying to redo that work or restart

464
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,360
that initiative within the w3c and I was

465
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,980
wondering if you knew anything about

466
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,940
that

467
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,340
right now I do not have any information

468
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,500
on that uh definitely something that

469
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,320
we'll be looking to get in contact with

470
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,299
and and be fully supportive whether you

471
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,000
know from the process perspective they

472
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,580
really have that here what that in input

473
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,340
for it we very much welcome any

474
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,100
adjustments or anything else to

475
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,200
make our community better yeah if

476
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,820
they're still working on it I think that

477
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,020
they would really like to talk to you

478
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,660
yes definitely would love to love to

479
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,780
join in with them so thank you thank you

480
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,059
hey uh Chris Whitfield with Twitter

481
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,980
um you noticed there you had a long list

482
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,740
of carriers for whom there are

483
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,960
uh parsers which presumably read the

484
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,400
body of the email to pick out the

485
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
necessary information

486
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,539
um is there ever any

487
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,679
any collaboration with those carriers

488
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,260
um with to write those parsers

489
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,620
question one question two how often do

490
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,320
those parsers have to be updated because

491
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,720
the carrier has changed the format of

492
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,480
their maintenance notifications those

493
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,980
are two great questions

494
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,740
um first off I think this Library itself

495
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,380
is definitely new in 2022 that we've put

496
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,280
out

497
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,140
um so we're we're looking to Branch out

498
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,360
you know where our skin in the game

499
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,760
isn't around anything specific with it

500
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,400
and we just we're looking to enhance the

501
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,740
the way we manage networks

502
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,260
um so definitely this Library hopefully

503
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,780
we're here to help show that

504
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,940
um and then follow up on that yes we

505
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,320
have definitely seen this in our clients

506
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,360
where hey we had everything all great

507
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,660
for a particular provider and nope now

508
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,640
there's some new characters in it so

509
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,320
we're looking at some ways to continue

510
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,080
to enhance that as well I think that

511
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,820
just had some conversation yesterday in

512
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,679
fact around how can we enhance this

513
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,039
further to be able hey if that template

514
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,840
changes how can we still ingest the

515
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,840
important data because a calendar

516
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,760
timestamp generally looks about the same

517
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,460
a circuit ID from a provider hopefully

518
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,500
doesn't change too much you know maybe

519
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,960
we change a dash to a period or there's

520
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,000
a space in there but do what we can to

521
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,200
ex to take that information in

522
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,500
thank you and yeah

523
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,220
uh Joel maslak from Netflix

524
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,220
my question is do you handle in the

525
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,520
parser changes to the notification start

526
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,320
and end notices those types of things

527
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,020
indeed we do so there's a few other

528
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,659
things I didn't show in here and that's

529
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,000
a great follow-on that I know Christian

530
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,640
who's can't join us today would uh

531
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,740
absolutely he'd hurt me probably next

532
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,600
time I see him but yeah so we support

533
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,460
the change in notifications we'll also

534
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,260
change the date for that notification

535
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,179
and there's a change log that goes along

536
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,280
with that so we're able with that

537
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,440
maintenance notification we key in on us

538
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,980
the ID or we make an ID on it for it and

539
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,799
then we will track that along but if

540
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,799
it's got changed the date or if it got

541
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,659
canceled we're able to put that kind of

542
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,400
notification in

543
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,679
um the follow-up on that as well that I

544
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,960
didn't get into this is if you get a

545
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,520
notification with a circuit that you

546
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,400
don't have in the database whether it

547
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,860
doesn't belong to you or you're if was

548
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,679
disconnected for some time ago and it's

549
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,120
you're still paying for you think you

550
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,039
disconnected it in your source of truth

551
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,600
but the carrier's still billing for you

552
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,280
and there's some maintenance we can have

553
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,039
we also alert on that type of thing so

554
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,480
thank you thank you

555
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,020
awesome and thank you for the time

556
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,510
