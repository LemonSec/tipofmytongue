he will be presenting internet impacts

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,300
due to the war in Ukraine

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,340
Doug is director of Internet analysis

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,260
for chemtech where he works on internet

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,020
infrastructure analysis

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,000
prior to Kentuck he was lead analyst for

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,380
oracles

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,240

formerly dine research and Renaissance

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,439
this is Doug's seventh time presenting

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,439
here at nanog Doug first spoke at nanog

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,620
in 2010 during a lightning talk session

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,500
about accidentally importing censorship

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,180
uh thank you welcome Doug

18
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,079
[Applause]

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,320
the largest war in Europe since World

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,239
War II is currently taking place in the

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,820
Ukraine a country with a robust internet

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,559
infrastructure that's been taking a

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,780
beating over the last eight months in

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,280
this talk I'd like to share some

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,600
observations from the internet

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,820
measurement perspective from folks uh

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,979
like myself internet Watchers

28
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,140
and um

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,780
this conflict is taking place in the age

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,780
of the internet and there are a lot of

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,860
unprecedented developments that have

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,140
taken place uh in this this year we're

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,299
going to talk about those starting

34
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,159
uh with what's your place has taken

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,420
place in Ukraine

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,520
so this

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,939
this story for me started two nanogs ago

38
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,040
when we were all in Austin when I

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,560
started we were winding down in analog

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,540
84 I started getting increased from the

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,520
media to confirm DDOS attacks against

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,159
prominent websites in Ukraine

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,439
so it started with the Ukrainian Army

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,780
website some banks were hit these were

45
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,180
Graphics I was putting out based on uh

46
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,520
kentic's aggregate netflow seeing these

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,860
DDOS attacks they're confirming them

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,100
over the course of a week the uh attacks

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,700
migrated to government and um uh cites

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,320
the parliament foreign Ministry

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,000
executive cabinet were hit with DDOS

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,920
attacks you know none of these attacks

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,840
were novel there's no novel technology

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,538
or record-breaking in size but they were

55
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,099
effective at disrupting access

56
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,379
especially for sites with limited DDOS

57
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,440
mitigation in place

58
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,020
but at this time the Russian army had

59
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,360
amassed on the Ukrainian border and it

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
was a lot of debate what was going to

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,660
happen uh the skepticism whether they

62
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,580
were actually going to invade we found

63
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,920
out the following day on the 24th of

64
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,020
February when Russian soldiers started

65
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,120
pouring over the border and attacking

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,520
Ukraine

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,400
one of the first impacts that we saw was

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,980
this uh an outage in the European

69
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,959
satellite operator via sat

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,599
this is a screenshot from Iota which is

71
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,400
an internet outage the dashboard put out

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,280
by Georgia Tech that is a public tool

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,440
with internet connectivity stats the

74
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,019
line along the top in green has bgb

75
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,700
routes those didn't have an effect to

76
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,040
put the didn't suffer any outages but

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,840
the blue line is is active measurement

78
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,660
so pings of things in this as dropped

79
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,819
dramatically within a couple days it was

80
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,500
confirmed that there was a destructive

81
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,040
malware that had been uh deployed into

82
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,319
this network causing ground terminals to

83
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,060
essentially self-destruct

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,700
and and later it was connected that this

85
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,500
was part of a Russian cyber op to go

86
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,840
hand in hand with the invasion uh

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,340
knowing that a lot of the Ukrainian

88
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,760
government was relying on this service

89
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,860
once the fighting started we saw a lot

90
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,440
of outages of just uh the major major

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,599
telecoms of the country so trioline is a

92
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,000
national Broadband provider this also

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,159
expect these guys experienced a an

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,080
outage probably the biggest one in the

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,260
initial days due to a separate fiber cup

96
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,260
they also uh experienced an outage uh

97
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,180
within a couple weeks of a Cyber attack

98
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,280
we didn't get a lot of elaboration on

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,840
that but it was something that we could

100
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,299
confirm in data so in this in the

101
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,459
graphics on the bottom the one from Iota

102
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,640
uh showing the March 9th Cyber attack uh

103
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,980
the Blue Line like the Via sat uh you

104
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,680
know the responding hosts drop uh down

105
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,540
uh significantly and then this is a

106
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,819
graphic from cloudflare who has their

107
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,739
public tool a radar

108
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,980
um that you can look up uh traffic for

109
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,938
any as or country

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,639
so Euchre Telecom or Ukraine Telecom is

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,699
the incumbent of of Ukraine and by our

112
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,740
stats kentic stats so this is the

113
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,080
seventh most popular destination for the

114
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,960
country so this is for traffic so it's

115
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,280
not the biggest Telecom but it's

116
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,860
important uh as

117
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,680
an incumbent it provides service to a

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,720
lot of government uh functionality as

119
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,340
well as it's the provider of Last Resort

120
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,960
for rural areas where it's not

121
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,940
profitable to have other other options

122
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,100
so it's a it's an important Network it

123
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,020
too is suffered a number of outages in

124
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,120
those opening weeks lasting typically

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,180
for a few hours and as we'll as we came

126
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,940
to learn was getting restored Often by

127
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,460
technicians going out to the recently

128
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,199
damaged

129
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,820
uh of damaged area due to bombing

130
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,220
UK Telecom also suffered a Cyber attack

131
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,680
we don't know all the details here but

132
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,840
we do know this was facilitated by Uh

133
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,479
Russian forces taking over a yucatalicom

134
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,759
facility and using the credentials of

135
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,280
captured technicians from ecru Telecom

136
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,139
to get inside the network and bring it

137
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,960
down uh this network was then uh this

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,699
outage only lasted a few hours but that

139
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,680
was uh the the cause of that

140
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,000
so those are all outages on the extreme

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,160
uh on the extremities of the internet in

142
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,860
Ukraine but um there were also how the

143
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,300
country connects to the global internet

144
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,340
was affected as well and this is an

145
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,000
example of one of those changes so we

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,740
have a product kentic Market

147
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,660
intelligence that tracks uh that

148
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,220
classifies all the as relationships

149
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,080
within the country and then scores them

150
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,639
based on address space going across the

151
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,039
edge and then this enabled us to do some

152
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,320
kind of longitudinal analysis to look at

153
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,620
how is Transit changing through time and

154
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,479
so this is an example where we saw

155
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,900
Vodafone Ukraine lose Transit from MTS

156
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,360
as a Russian mobile provider and around

157
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,039
the same time that their parent company

158
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,800
Vodafone out of the UK suspended its

159
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,259
partnership with MTS out of Russia Over

160
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,080
The Invasion so the real world events

161
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,840
have effects on Transit as well

162
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,840
uh going through the country uh all the

163
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,520
transit effects of this year they

164
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,440
typically fall into two buckets one the

165
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,199
one on the left for example data group

166
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,600
losing uh Transit from Ross roscom

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
another Russian provider this one I

168
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,580
don't know the background if this was

169
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,880
due to a infrastructure

170
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,639
failure or a conscious decision to not

171
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,500
use Russian Transit on the part of this

172
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,560
this company or the other if they didn't

173
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,660
lose Russian Transit then you saw stuff

174
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,880
like this that we saw from bullia which

175
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,740
is a mobile operator for the country

176
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,280
where there's a lot of instability uh as

177
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,900
different Transit providers are are

178
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,759
getting knocked out and traffic's

179
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,680
shifting to from one to another they

180
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,199
stay online but uh it's a

181
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,479
uh it was had it was an unstable period

182
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,719
there

183
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,660
so shifting over from uh Ukraine over to

184
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,300
Russia there was a lot of impact on uh

185
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,880
the invading country as well

186
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,180
so two days after the invasion uh

187
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,500
Ukraine's minister of digital

188
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,300
transformation put out a call to the

189
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,759
world for a volunteer I.T Army of

190
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,919
hackers to attack these 31 prominent

191
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,120
websites

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,819
this is a first that I think many of us

193
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,800
have ever seen if you wanted to

194
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,720
participate in this conflict and you had

195
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,240
sympathies to the ukrainians you could

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,819
from your bedroom uh start you know

197
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,819
launching attacks on things he called it

198
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,160
World cyber War one and this actually

199
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,139
continues to this day each day there's a

200
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,819
telegram Channel it puts out things to

201
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,160
attack it even includes advice on what

202
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,139
you which U.S cloud providers are most

203
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,240
lenient on allowing you to launch

204
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,819
attacks from their Network

205
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,919
look it up

206
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,440
um even before that uh even before the

207
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,060
the call to action we started seeing

208
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,099
DDOS attacks against Russian targets

209
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,099
these are typically prominent uh

210
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,880
symbolic targets like kremlin.ru uh

211
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,160
again I was as this was happening I was

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,660
putting out uh and we were seeing this

213
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,160
in our data and just confirming that

214
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,319
things these things were taking place uh

215
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,479
the banks the major banks in Russia were

216
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,919
also targets of these things

217
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,839
and so as a result uh Russia started

218
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,240
taking uh evasive actions to get out of

219
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,760
uh the path of some of these attacks one

220
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,640
of the uh things that we spotted was one

221
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,919
of the this e-government self-service

222
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,800
platform for Russia uh was normally as

223
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,380
is four by as it only have its routes

224
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,839
announced through Ross Telecom onto its

225
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,620
International providers and and peers uh

226
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,200
on this day all the routes came down

227
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,300
this is a view out of Iota because from

228
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,920
the outside world it looked like the

229
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,480
went off the cliff and this network was

230
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,459
was taken offline and left the global

231
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,339
routing table which it kind of did the

232
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,440
um but the routes were still in

233
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,720
circulation within within Russia the the

234
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,580
site was accessible within Russia but

235
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,640
this was a tactic to try to limit the

236
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,260
impacts of DDOS attacks coming from

237
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,519
outside of the country

238
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,540
foreign

239
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,180
the it Army call we have this other uh

240
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,519
request that again people like me

241
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,779
haven't seen anything like this before

242
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,820
where the government of Ukraine asked

243
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,440
that Russia be disconnected from the

244
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,140
global internet their requests I can and

245
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,800
right included uh revoking the cctlds uh

246
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,899
for Russia withdrawing the right to have

247
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,320
V4 and V6 uh address space among other

248
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,420
things

249
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,339
unsurprisingly I can and ripe uh refuse

250
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,220
to uh you know to do this

251
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,200
um wanting to stay out of the the

252
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,519
political

253
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,560
um uh any kind of political stuff plus

254
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,959
the view there is that um you know the

255
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,880
internet is a neutral technology and

256
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,040
shouldn't be used in this manner that's

257
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,740
all setting aside how would you unpract

258
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,420
the practicalities of trying to

259
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,820
implement such a thing but nonetheless

260
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,800
it took place and this led to a

261
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,980
conversation that start that uh this

262
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,800
Converse controversial idea of

263
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,839
um you know could there be uh internet

264
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,580
this internet sanctions project could

265
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,620
you use the internet governance model to

266
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,620
kind of crowdsource if you uh what you

267
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,839
would want to block in a in a in a

268
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,600
country if uh if you chose to do so so

269
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,459
the idea is to try to limit collateral

270
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,700
damage on civilian access to information

271
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,680
which doesn't serve anybody's purpose if

272
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,019
you were able to cut them off because at

273
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,880
this time if you recall says a few

274
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,100
months ago there were people that were

275
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,600
were companies that were blocking

276
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,180
everything in Russia and so that's not

277
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,279
that's kind of a counterproductive move

278
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,220
so this this hadn't really this this

279
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,720
effort didn't really catch on but it's

280
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,940
another uh you know we're breaking new

281
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,620
ground in this age of the internet

282
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,220
so the uh in the the opening weeks of

283
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,800
this conflict did not go as planned for

284
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,380
Russia the news looked bad and so as a

285
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,420
result of the Russian government ordered

286
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,940
the blocking of independent Russian news

287
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,160
as well as foreign news sites and they

288
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,700
did so uh using a piecemeal mechanism so

289
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,399
there is no great firewall of Russia as

290
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,200
much as they would aspire to have such a

291
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,839
thing the way it typically gets

292
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,760
implemented is the government issues an

293
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,040
order each ISP has got to implement

294
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,959
these blocks on their own and so you end

295
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,300
up with a kind of a piecemeal

296
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,579
um approach and so uni if you're not

297
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,660
familiar with them this is the open

298
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,339
Observatory for Network interference

299
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,079
it's published a number of reports this

300
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,880
year this was one documenting the

301
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,100
technical mechanisms used to block these

302
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,240
sites and uh it's a screenshot from uh

303
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,160
from that report

304
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,600
so this effort led to uh inadvertent bgp

305
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,480
hijack of Twitter on March 28th so for

306
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,399
less than an hour uh this one Russian

307
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,399
Telecom uh announced uh hijacked this

308
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,579
slash 24 belonging to Twitter and it uh

309
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,500
they probably intended to keep this

310
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,940
local just to Black Hole the traffic

311
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,920
within their Network it leaked out onto

312
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,300
the internet and caused some disruption

313
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,220
what's interesting is that this slash 24

314
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,660
was the same slash 24 that was hijacked

315
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,540
one year prior almost to the day during

316
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,000
the military coup in Myanmar so in that

317
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,040
case the government had given the order

318
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,579
similar to Russia uh block these things

319
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,459
Twitter's on that list and you're on

320
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,079
your own of how to do it and so one of

321
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,420
the providers in Myanmar a year ago then

322
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,760
uh uh decided they were going to

323
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,160
announce uh the same slash 24 it leaked

324
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,800
out at an exchange in in Singapore and

325
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,019
users in South Asia and Southeast Asia

326
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,420
uh had trouble reaching Twitter for a a

327
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,279
period of time

328
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,899
so the difference between what took

329
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,760
place last year in Myanmar and this year

330
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,279
in Russia for this prefix is that in the

331
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,620
intervening time Twitter uh created Rose

332
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,320
for all of their routes and so this time

333
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,380
around uh there was if for a networks

334
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,680
that evaluated uh did RPI evaluation

335
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,200
this would show up as an invalid it was

336
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,339
getting rejected and I think that

337
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,019
limited uh quite a bit of the the

338
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,500
propagation of this route and I don't

339
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,760
think there's a lot of practical impact

340
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,779
but this did take place

341
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,120
so another uh another unprecedented

342
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,800
development was this announcement by

343
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,220
Major backbone providers to curtail

344
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,760
operations in Russia uh so on March 3rd

345
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,019
uh 20 2022 this year uh cogent sent an

346
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,820
email to all of their Russian customers

347
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,399
saying that tomorrow this is they set

348
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,019
this on a Thursday tomorrow's Friday

349
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,300
tomorrow service your service will be

350
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,120
discontinued due to the invasion

351
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,839
um

352
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,040
so we uh uh caught wind of this uh and

353
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,220
um wrote something up in the end uh ttk

354
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,160
uh trans Telecom the other National fix

355
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,740
fix line provider of Russia and Beyond

356
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,740
which used to be vimplecom were among a

357
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,420
handful of Russian networks that were uh

358
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,040
that were in the end disconnected on

359
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,500
this day uh within a week Von was

360
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,839
reconnected and other Russian customers

361
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,639
such as like Ross Telecom the state

362
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,380
Telecom Russia that was a coaching

363
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,660
customer was never disconnected

364
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,060
um and in the end uh illumin within a

365
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,100
couple days had announced uh their own

366
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,899
version of this statement saying that

367
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,339
they were taking immediate steps to

368
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,160
cease operations in the region

369
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,839
um you know no no customers were

370
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,300
disconnected I think their logic is that

371
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,920
their traffic handoffs take place in

372
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,360
Stockholm and Frankfurt so they're not

373
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,339
really operating in the region uh it's

374
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,220
it's semantics but in the end uh Russia

375
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,019
continues to be well connected to the

376
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,000
global internet

377
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,360
links also had uh decided to disconnect

378
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,540
Ross Telecom fun a meal out in ripe had

379
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,459
a good analysis of the impacts of that

380
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,440
but in the long and short of a Russian

381
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,000
continues to be connected to the global

382
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,120
internet

383
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,060
so if you've been following this uh uh

384
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,920
this conflict you know the initial phase

385
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,019
was uh the Russian army was trying to

386
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,600
attack Kiev to quickly topple the

387
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,620
government and take over the country

388
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,800
that didn't work out and so they

389
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,779
changed their strategy to focus on the

390
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,940
East and the South areas that they had a

391
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,360
better chance of of taking and so

392
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,180
uh this is what we um uh some some

393
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,540
comments on that so in the Eastern Area

394
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,399
referred to as the Don bass region the

395
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,019
dawn is the river that goes through that

396
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,699
that part of the country

397
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,019
we're talking about specifically the

398
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,380
netsk and lahansk and so these areas are

399
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,060
starting you know historically have

400
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,220
often uh used Russian Transit simply

401
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,380
because they are uh the proximity to

402
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,779
Russia they border uh Russia

403
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,420
um when this when this all this conflict

404
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,060
started uh happening in 2014 many years

405
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,519
ago uh there was a lot of disconnection

406
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,579
and rewiring of just uh just getting

407
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,220
Transit from Russia and uh so they end

408
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,660
up being a bit of a partition between

409
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,839
these parts of the of the country

410
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,779
luhansk uh you know both these areas are

411
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,180
um have been over the years uh

412
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,220
self-proclaimed independent uh areas

413
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,320
independent from the central Ukrainian

414
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,019
government and it's a bit of a lawless

415
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,959
place so there's a lot of bad uh bad

416
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,600
stuff that comes out of luhansk if you

417
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,240
recall the bgb DNS hijacks of Route the

418
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,399
Route 53 and my ether wallet well that

419
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,440
was directed to a Data Center and uh

420
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,880
users were directed to a data center in

421
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,120
luhansk to get their

422
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,440
cryptocurrency stolen a couple months

423
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,600
later there was a bgb DNS hijack against

424
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,940
major payment processors that too was

425
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,759
redirected to bogus sites in uh and

426
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,720
lahansk so um there is a as I mentioned

427
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,980
there's an internet partition if you

428
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,720
were to take a rape Atlas probe or run

429
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,000
your own trace route from something like

430
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,359
the netsk on to something in the main uh

431
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,119
part of Ukraine you may find a path not

432
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,099
unlike this where you get directed up to

433
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,439
Moscow to Saint Petersburg over to

434
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,099
Stockholm Frankfort back to Kiev uh onto

435
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,660
wherever where you're running a trace

436
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,520
route to and so these things may be

437
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,280
right next to each other uh on a map but

438
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,660
as far as the internet goes these things

439
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,579
are very far apart in fact they're you

440
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,839
know on the order of a Pacific Ocean

441
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,040
apart

442
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,480
as far as round trip latencies

443
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,299
another thing that took place uh was

444
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,820
this a switchover of the city of Curson

445
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,640
over to Russian Transit so in March 2014

446
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,840
when Russia annexed the Crimean

447
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,179
Peninsula from Ukraine one of the things

448
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,700
that they did was uh prime minister

449
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,299
Medvedev had traveled to uh the uh the

450
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,299
semester poll or Sephora poll made a

451
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,679
speech about how

452
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,700
it was unaccessible that uh Crimean

453
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,320
traffic or Russian traffic would go over

454
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,299
four networks foreign being Ukraine in

455
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,280
that context and ordered Ross Telecom to

456
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,960
build a submarine cable uh over the

457
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Kirch Strait the little uh bit of land a

458
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,539
bit of water that separates Russia from

459
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:19,140
Crimea uh so in my this is back in my

460
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,880
days with Renaissance we were following

461
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,740
this closely we spotted the appearance

462
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,980
of Miranda media uh this

463
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,820
as201776 uh in July 2014 and then uh it

464
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,260
started carrying traffic within a week

465
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,160
uh over that year a lot of uh the as's

466
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,559
were switched over to uh Russian Transit

467
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,120
and

468
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,160
um we saw something similar happen in

469
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,780
croissants it was a city in the South

470
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,100
and so I had worked with the New York

471
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,799
Times this summer on a interactive uh

472
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,720
piece that made the front page of the of

473
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,940
the paper uh this is a visualization

474
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,320
based on some of the data that I

475
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,020
provided them and then on the left if

476
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,640
you can can't tell the difference I made

477
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,520
the one on the right as my animation uh

478
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,860
and um so I'm looking we're looking at

479
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,780
this is the bgp level as is switching

480
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,280
over uh and if you look at the beginning

481
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,620
like right now you have got many paths

482
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,360
to Ukrainian providers connecting to the

483
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,000
uh the Ukraine and onto the

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,980
international uh Network International

485
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,700
uh Global Internet switched with uh all

486
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,980
going through a single as Miranda media

487
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,380
that goes again through a single as rust

488
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,320
Telecom if you look in this graphic from

489
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,660
New York Times the little dots in the uh

490
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,940
and croissant are the as's but they

491
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,280
didn't want to uh mention the word as

492
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,020
because they have to Define uh internet

493
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,520
routing and uh no one was going to

494
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,200
understand that

495
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,299
so uh

496
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,220
let's see

497
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,419
so if you've been following the news

498
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,580
again you know the in recent weeks

499
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,740
there's been this Iranian uh excuse me

500
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,620
uh Ukraine camera counter offensive

501
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,740
uh followed by a Russian retaliation

502
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,900
so the Ukraine has been gaining ground

503
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,440
uh uh especially in the East around uh

504
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,679
kharkiv and then they did this uh

505
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,780
um ambitious attack against the Kirch

506
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,880
Bridge so I mentioned the Kirch cable

507
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,799
the summary cable that goes across the

508
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,960
curse straight that was built in 2014

509
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,640
well four years later there was this

510
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,679
built this bridge is both a automobile

511
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,980
and a train bridge was built in 20

512
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,500
finished in 2018.

513
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,260
um this is what was uh attacked just a

514
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,460
couple of weeks ago

515
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,700
uh I uh I'll give credit to remain here

516
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,160
from iaj who spotted the uh the impact

517
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,140
on the internet there really wasn't a

518
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,720
lot of impact to uh Crimean internet

519
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,880
connectivity they must still rely

520
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,860
primarily on the submarine cable I would

521
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,059
have thought that they would have used

522
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,520
laid some cable on the bridge that would

523
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,480
have been taken out but there really

524
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,039
wasn't a lot of

525
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,220
a lot of impact but the um two days

526
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,500
later uh the Russian forces launched

527
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,940
cruise missiles into cities across

528
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,780
Ukraine and uh we we saw impact uh this

529
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,020
is our net flow uh data aggregate

530
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,200
netflow showing traffic dropping off in

531
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,780
different cities uh as power stations

532
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,140
are are taking out fiber lines are cut

533
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,360
and there was um there was quite a lot

534
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,100
of Destruction caused on these

535
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,360
retaliatory attacks

536
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,260
so to wrap up

537
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,480
um in the end uh Ukraine has stayed

538
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,360
online so these are grass I made uh or I

539
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,640
gathered together in the you know

540
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,799
opening 30 days of the uh of the

541
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,620
conflict uh showing by a variety of

542
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,820
different

543
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,159
mechanisms uh different data sources

544
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,000
that Ukraine stayed online uh and each

545
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,220
show some sort of a dip so in the top

546
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,740
left we have Iota looking at bgb routes

547
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,240
there's only a slight dip most of the

548
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,460
routes stayed up there's uh their active

549
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,080
measurement the blue line is a bit of a

550
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,360
dip as things are unreachable either

551
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,460
they've been broken let power as out

552
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,740
people have turned things off and then

553
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,480
these other ones are traffic based so

554
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,280
you have cloudflare on the bottom left

555
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,260
and Google in the bottom right also

556
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,020
showing a a decline in the volume of

557
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,179
traffic and then uh it's a graphic from

558
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,120
our Aggregate netflow and so this could

559
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,740
be explained by a number of

560
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,320
a number of reasons you know and after

561
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,600
the initial invasion you had hundreds of

562
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,740
millions of people or not hundreds of

563
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,480
millions millions of people

564
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,039
um uh fleeing the country and so that's

565
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,620
going to have an impact on the uh uh the

566
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,880
the traffic that gets pushed in and out

567
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,640
of the country uh there's also uh

568
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,720
infrastructure that was getting

569
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,480
destroyed uh that um it's going to

570
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,520
affect traffic and then also even for

571
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,440
the folks that stayed in this country

572
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,780
you know life was not the same after

573
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,780
February 24th and so that too has an

574
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,880
effect on how they use the internet and

575
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,980
shows up on all these stats but in the

576
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,240
end the state the country stayed online

577
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,580
it has a very robust infrastructure that

578
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,919
a lot of people have commented on

579
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,440
but this is an important footnote in

580
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,900
this uh in this story of this conflict

581
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,020
this year you know this the maintaining

582
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,400
internet connectivity in this country

583
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,600
has been critical for a number of

584
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,940
reasons it was crucial for the

585
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,059
government to Rally Global support Jihad

586
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,100
zielinski with his cabinet in the

587
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,140
streets of Kiev uh recording videos

588
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,460
saying they're going to stay they're

589
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,100
going to fight and help us uh with our

590
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,780
with this with this battle

591
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,640
uh critical for news organizations

592
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,200
coming in if you've followed us

593
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,820
certainly in the opening weeks uh

594
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,260
reporters were able to file stories just

595
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,059
on their iPhones connecting to the local

596
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,760
mobile service uh the internet was

597
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,840
useful for that

598
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,360
and then for ukrainians to show what was

599
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,220
happening in their country and be able

600
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,200
to uh connect the loved ones let them

601
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,059
know that they are still still okay

602
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,159
and this was enabled by uh technicians

603
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,840
these are folks this is our industry

604
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,000
this is our people of our industry in

605
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,720
Ukraine going out to places freshly uh

606
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,900
attacked uh sites getting to uh getting

607
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,360
destroyed these guys had great uh great

608
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,879
risks themselves uh yeah

609
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,000
thank you

610
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,799
at Great risk themselves would travel

611
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,980
out uh to recently attacked places

612
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,059
reconnecting fiber lines and keeping

613
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,159
their countrymen online

614
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,720
it's a it's an inspiring thing

615
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,280
so in the age of uh age of the internet

616
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,100
here's what uh

617
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,059
um

618
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,220
this war shows us we have these DDOS

619
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,919
attacks the I.T Army uh launching stuff

620
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,400
both in Ukraine and Russia outages due

621
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,980
to the straight fiber lines and cyber

622
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,200
attacks uh knocking things temporarily

623
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,559
offline and then this heroic effort by

624
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,419
uh Ukrainian technicians going out and

625
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,179
repairing severed fiber lines

626
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,919
there's a lot of blowback against the

627
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,500
aggressor in this case the Russia uh had

628
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,659
to silence their own social media news

629
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,520
blockage and um and there was this

630
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,900
discussion of like should they be

631
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,460
disconnected

632
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,080
um that's that's something new we're

633
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,080
breaking new ground on this and then you

634
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,940
know this uh the

635
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,340
assimilation of of Curson into the

636
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,799
Russian fold to uh not just the internet

637
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,240
we I see it from the internet

638
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,679
perspective of the transit being

639
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,179
switched over to Russian Transit but the

640
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,400
phone lines they have a Russian you know

641
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,840
country code you have to dial to reach

642
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,419
them now uh the everything that they

643
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,360
every part of society gets uh

644
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,100
assimilated into the Russian way of

645
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,500
doing things and we'll see uh if this

646
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,480
current counter-offensive is successful

647
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,039
in that part of the world

648
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,740
maybe at some point soon we'll see this

649
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,919
switch back to Ukrainian Transit it's

650
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,820
something I keep an eye on

651
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,779
and if you'd like to help I'm sure if

652
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:39,360
you've attended any nog event in this

653
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,520
this year you've probably sat through a

654
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,860
presentation by the keep Ukraine

655
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,260
connected effort uh those are these are

656
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,020
folks in based in Europe that are

657
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,240
sourcing a lot of fiber optic equipment

658
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,539
they are physically driving it into

659
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:56,580
Ukraine to equip those folks you saw in

660
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,500
those photos a couple of weeks prior to

661
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,659
keep them flushed with equipment to keep

662
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,120
the repairs going they take donations

663
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,779
money they take equipment any if you

664
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,120
want to help this is an organization

665
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,100
that you can use uh to do that

666
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,059
that's my talk does any questions

667
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,220
all right

668
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,860
howdy thank you for that talk uh so I

669
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,020
guess right now what I'm seeing in the

670
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,760
news is this interesting delineation

671
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,679
between the terrestrial networks which

672
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,480
is our business and the non-terrestrial

673
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,299
networks right like Starling right

674
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,100
exactly so there's this convergence

675
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,020
that's clearly happening right now for

676
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,059
us so I'd love to hear your thoughts and

677
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,159
opinions on the potential termination of

678
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,080
the Starling connection yeah starlink is

679
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,820
kind of uh yeah I guess that's a that's

680
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,799
a glaring Omission in this talk is any

681
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,440
comment uh around starlink so

682
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,840
um it is a is a big Topic in the news so

683
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,520
this is a closed system this makes it

684
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,620
difficult uh to study from an internet

685
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,120
measurement standpoint if you imagine

686
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,039
you've got a Ground Terminal goes up to

687
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,340
a satellite and then bounces down to a a

688
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,860
ground station somewhere in your cell uh

689
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,620
as the is the uh the way it's configured

690
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,220
there are uh they had announced uh

691
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,740
um new sites in Kiev at least he's in

692
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,299
their geoip that they published there's

693
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,580
a Kiev ground station

694
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,900
um it's not guaranteed that's where they

695
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,940
would come down but it's it's it's

696
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,340
challenging to see and we can see

697
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,320
traffic that gets mapped as Ukraine but

698
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,880
it's uh it's hard to know

699
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,039
how much of that is um

700
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,539
uh

701
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,799
yeah I don't know I don't know how much

702
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,320
we have a insight into starlink and I

703
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,860
also say that all these graphs of this

704
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,380
is all this is all terrestrial uh

705
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,320
connectivity fiber terrestrial and um

706
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,539
there is no way that a satellite service

707
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,179
is gonna replace the capacity the

708
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,340
terrestrial fiber fiber is going to

709
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,279
offer and I think some of the reporting

710
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,059
it gets a little confused I I find where

711
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,100
um uh yeah like even the Ukrainian

712
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,900
government recently said starlink that's

713
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,279
keeping the country online I was like

714
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,919
well when that's not possible uh I'm

715
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,900
sure it's super helpful I mean as a

716
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,520
former military Communications officer

717
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,860
uh like I'm sure the the way that the

718
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,200
major contribution is tactical

719
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,059
Communications uh that's where this

720
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,400
would be super useful but again Elon

721
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,260
Musk didn't didn't invent that that

722
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,240
existed a long time ago I carried an

723
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,860
iridium phone in Iraq in the first year

724
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,140
of the war like we had uh satellite

725
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,840
connectivity uh before that but anyway

726
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,880
don't get me going on starlink uh but

727
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,220
it's a it's a

728
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,960
it's it's definitely contributing I I

729
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,480
you know it's helping I'll see you uh

730
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,580
Chris can I get the guy behind you uh no

731
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,159
you yeah sorry hi uh Marty strong from

732
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:44,159
meta uh two things I learned and one

733
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,900
quick question

734
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,820
um you said about the Russian Transit as

735
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,320
far as I understand

736
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,720
the fibers would deliberately severed

737
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,220
because they didn't want Russian

738
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,620
connectivity to Ukraine I'm sorry can

739
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,880
you say that one more time the Russian

740
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,100
the fiber across the border from Ukraine

741
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,720
into Russia was deliberately severed

742
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,539
okay I think he said the 28th because

743
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:04,919
they didn't want the connectivity to

744
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,919
remain okay the number of Russian ixes

745
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,539
and other operators actually had Pops in

746
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,340
in Kiev that were completely cut off at

747
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,080
that point

748
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,820
um sorry deliberately severed by

749
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,880
ukrainians yeah ukrainians okay

750
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,340
um the the part on the the Russia slide

751
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,179
about

752
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,360
blocking actually the Russian regulator

753
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,820
has their own DPI equipment in the

754
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,760
Russian operators so they are pushing

755
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,679
out the blocking rules themselves

756
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,899
and there was a case where they they did

757
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,760
this before The Invasion where they were

758
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,919
trying to throttle

759
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,260
I think it was Twitter it was I'm

760
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,360
familiar with uh yesterday yeah they

761
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,000
they were they were blocking t.co the

762
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,380
shortener but then they ended up it was

763
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,620
a regex uh thing so so when we have been

764
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,559
blocked recently because of the

765
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,880
extremist organization that that was

766
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,320
rolled out without the knowledge of the

767
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,419
operators in advance it was just blanket

768
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,399
pushed out and then

769
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,380
The Operators yeah so there is some

770
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,600
that's a fairly new development that

771
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,159
there's uh there is some centralized

772
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:08,640
capability but then um uh yeah I don't

773
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,779
know it's it's it doesn't cover

774
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,580
everything and so that's typically the

775
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,320
large the largest operators that they

776
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,419
have there okay equipment in um the

777
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,580
question I had was on your slide with

778
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,340
blown up infrastructure did you find

779
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,919
that there was extended periods of

780
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,899
outage not necessarily by fiber Cuts but

781
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:29,658
by the electricity grid being down

782
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,880
um well I I the graphics that were up

783
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,440
earlier I think are representative of

784
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,539
most of the stuff we saw were it's uh

785
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,640
usually things appeared from an internet

786
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,020
measurement standpoint this is the best

787
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,059
I can do uh to be restored in a matter

788
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,260
of hours

789
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,200
but is that a a technician like in one

790
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,179
of these pictures uh create a fixing a

791
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,159
fiber line or a power station coming

792
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,840
back online

793
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,460
um sometimes that's hard to to tell the

794
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,659
difference so I know some of the

795
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,279
infrastructure was down because when the

796
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,440
grid was bombed they are light Ila sites

797
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,539
ran out of diesel in their generators to

798
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,700
keep the science online so whilst the

799
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,799
fiber was not cut they couldn't keep up

800
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,720
all the repeater stations sure to keep

801
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,399
the second one to end which was actually

802
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,899
a lot more difficult because they had to

803
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:11,399
fix the electricity grid and not just

804
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,140
splice Vibes together

805
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,000
all right thanks thank you all right

806
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,740
Chris I think it's going to be you

807
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,720
last uh Chris Woodfield with Twitter

808
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,940
first off happy to be an RP and Kai

809
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,980
success story yeah thank you for

810
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,659
pointing that out

811
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:29,580
um so uh but this is your talk not mine

812
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,700
um is it so the question I have is

813
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,940
what what was your what was the external

814
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,860
observations and the difference in the

815
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,799
impact between the Myanmar route leak

816
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,919
and which did not have rpki and the

817
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,899
Russian the Russian right League that

818
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:46,919
did

819
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,500
um it is really hard to is hard to

820
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,559
compare apples to apples in this case uh

821
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,720
so you have in Myanmar uh a leak

822
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,860
happening at an exchange uh in uh the

823
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,299
Russian case is going through Transit

824
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,679
relationships

825
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,320
um and uh yeah there is a difference in

826
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,240
the amount of propagation but uh there's

827
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,159
so many like there's other ways people

828
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,140
filter stuff besides RPI so it ends up

829
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,600
being you know if both were the same

830
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,240
league coming out of the same as then

831
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,760
maybe you'd have a chance of of reliably

832
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,200
comparing the two and seeing the effect

833
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,919
of rpkai uh but given there's so many

834
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,840
different factors I think it's it's hard

835
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,260
I I guess I I in my heart believe the

836
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,419
archive helped uh the propagation what

837
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:31,679
there wasn't very much propagation this

838
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,440
time around and I think rpki was was uh

839
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,440
important for that thank you thanks

840
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,100
all right thanks

841
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,100
