good morning everyone

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,560
um I see many familiar faces for those

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,780
who I also see new faces and for those

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,640
remote who don't know me I'm John Curran

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,219
I'm the president and CEO of Aaron I've

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,200
been in the industry a while

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,559
I was the CTO of Bolt barenak and Newman

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,180
BBN CTO of EXO Communications uh CTO of

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,760
a hosting company server Vault

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,039
um but I'm really here about the

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
internet number registry system uh I was

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
involved in founding Aaron in 1997 I

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
served on the board as chairman for 12

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,780
years and then for the last 12 years

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,320
I've served as the CEO of Aaron and um I

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,080
was asked by a couple of people hey

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
there's things going on in the global

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,220
internet number registry system you

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,020
might know about them can you come talk

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,900
to Aaron out to nanog because it's right

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,400
before the Aaron meeting which follows

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,900
this and I said sure

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,299
so I have about 14 slides and we have

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,939
about 14 minutes I'm gonna go a little

36
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,680
quicker than one minute per slide

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,659
because you might want to get one or two

38
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,880
questions in I may not be able to answer

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,439
your questions I'm going to tell you

40
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,540
this is some interesting and sensitive

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,600
topics and so as a result is not

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,220
everything I can I'm going to be able to

43
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,280
answer but I'll do my best okay so five

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,020
rirs we just heard from someone from

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,720
Ripe earlier Aaron lachnick AP Nick and

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,579
afrenec I'm going to be talking about

47
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,020
global developments predominantly in

48
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,759
Africa because that's the where the

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,740
questions have been raised

50
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,500
uh this is the precursor that says I may

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
not answer your question

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,280
um we don't normally comment on disputes

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,560
or matters going on at Aaron we don't

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,060
come in on disputes or matters at other

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,699
rirs that's our general practice there's

56
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,098
some exceptions which I'll talk about

57
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:12,900
however since I was asked I'm going to

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,879
try to bring everyone up to speed on

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,140
what's going on

60
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,959
so there's been some legal developments

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,440
um and uh there's legal developments on

62
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,720
all the rirs that's a common thing that

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,459
in and of itself doesn't actually

64
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,920
warrant attention here of what's

65
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,560
happening in afternet however there's

66
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,080
some implications on this particular set

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
so in 2020 Africa completed a registry

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,580
audit

69
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,459
and um one of the customers in the

70
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,260
registry audit was a customer called

71
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,140
Cloud Innovation and afternet requested

72
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,860
more information from cloud innovation

73
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,480
and a termination was made after that

74
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,280
that

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,459
Cloud Innovation uh wasn't using the

76
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,120
resources the way that it asked for them

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,040
and that they should be revoked after a

78
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,160
customer transition period

79
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,739
um Cloud Innovation principle is a

80
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,280
gentleman named uh luheng Mr Lewin is

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,019
businesses disputed afternix authority

82
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,260
to enforce its agreement in this regard

83
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,420
and so this is the core basis this is

84
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,640
what kicked off everything

85
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,959
um

86
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,900
luhang engaged in several legal actions

87
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,360
in the Mauritius courts to prevent

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,580
africanic from returning a prevent

89
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,019
having to return to its addressed blocks

90
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,040
to Africa

91
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,019
and this is a good thing

92
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,480
okay the fact of the matter is that

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,180
people have agreements with our IRS and

94
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,560
you should be able to go to court and

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,819
protect your rights there's nothing

96
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,799
wrong with that that's a good thing you

97
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,420
have agreements with Aaron if you think

98
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,680
your rights are being stomped on you

99
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,480
should be able to go to work Accord and

100
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,220
have them enforce that's otherwise

101
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,840
what's the point of an agreement if you

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,720
can't enforce it okay so the fact that

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,159
there's a court action for someone to

104
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,140
protect their rights isn't in and of

105
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,540
itself not a problem and no one should

106
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,280
be concerned about that and as I said

107
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,560
that does happen from time to time

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,060
however

109
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,560
um one motion

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,019
that was filed froze afternix bank

111
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,659
accounts now this is where we take a

112
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,819
sort of left turn because the moment you

113
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,738
freeze the bank accounts for an rir

114
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,660
you're no longer paying the staff you

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,100
may not be paying the Telecommunications

116
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,779
bills you may not be paying the

117
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,419
co-location bill you may not be paying

118
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,840
for Fairly essential services that are

119
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,479
involved in keeping one-fifth of the rir

120
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,479
system running that's an issue okay and

121
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,240
that's somewhat unexpected uh it

122
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,360
probably wouldn't happen in uh the U.S

123
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,759
legal system for example but it did

124
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,600
happen

125
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,900
and once that happened this was no

126
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,460
longer just an African matter this is a

127
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,020
question of the whether or not the

128
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,460
internet number registry system was

129
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,560
still going to be running and actually

130
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,500
all the rirs at that point got involved

131
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,600
um there was quite a bit of activity

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,720
and that order was uh modified and and

133
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,000
changed such that it's not applicable

134
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
freezing order was removed they were

135
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
able to pay their staff but it was a fun

136
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,919
and colorful time

137
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,800
um there's been more orders the last one

138
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,780
was an injunction entered as a result of

139
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,660
another filing asking preventing African

140
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,960
from holding its elections and um

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,600
because of that African was unable to

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
hold this last elections therefore it

143
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,199
doesn't have a board if you don't have

144
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,880
enough members on your board you don't

145
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,919
have Forum if you don't have Quorum you

146
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,500
can't do certain business yeah very

147
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,880
difficult doing certain activities

148
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,340
there's exceptions everyone has various

149
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,080
Provisions in their bylaws but if you

150
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,699
don't have a board

151
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,460
you are running on borrowed time there's

152
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,139
only certain activities you can and

153
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,759
can't do

154
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,039
um one of the members of Africa actually

155
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,960
the CEO of Africa who's a member of

156
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,020
Africa uh went to the court and said I'm

157
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,000
gonna ask you to appoint interim

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,560
directors so we can function as a

159
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,539
business

160
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:05,639
and ask for a list he didn't want to

161
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,620
provide it himself he asked the African

162
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,660
telecommunications Union give me a list

163
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,340
of some people who could serve in this

164
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,960
interim role

165
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
now

166
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,919
while this is all going on and those

167
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,139
activities are the ones that were the

168
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,699
ones that were most colorful in terms of

169
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:24,900
endangering the possibility of the

170
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,180
entire registry system there's also been

171
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,800
quite a bit of litigation

172
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,199
there's more than 40 claims filed

173
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,699
against africanic

174
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,639
uh majority of which from cloud

175
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,280
Innovation when you have that much legal

176
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,560
work you actually end up having to

177
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,139
dedicate enormous resources to

178
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,180
responding to that and that actually now

179
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,900
is uh becoming an issue

180
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,300
um so when we look at the set of

181
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,100
activities this is why I'm sort of

182
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,560
briefing you because it has caused the

183
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,259
other rirs to get involved

184
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:58,860
um

185
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,319
as a result of the

186
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,620
last governance activity uh as I said

187
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,300
there was a there's a request in

188
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,560
presently before the court to get

189
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,720
directives to be appointed temporarily

190
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,180
so African function that's still pending

191
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,100
we hope that that will get resolved the

192
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,780
rars haven't been involved that's been

193
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,539
entirely within African and its members

194
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,819
filing motions to do that

195
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,319
but

196
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,139
um that's the current thing before us if

197
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,819
you want to know why we got involved in

198
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,460
the past and how we got involved

199
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,360
um I want to say that there's now a

200
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,960
um

201
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,259
publicity campaign against africanic and

202
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,699
the regional internet registry system

203
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,979
put on by an organization called the

204
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,740
number resource Society now there is an

205
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,419
organization called the nro by the way

206
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,039
the number resource organization it's

207
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,440
the five-hours working together NRS and

208
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,960
nro are two very different things you

209
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,259
might see NRS materials they

210
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,020
um assert that the rir system isn't

211
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,639
functioning properly and you should know

212
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,020
about that that's something few should

213
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,479
read and pay attention to and and see

214
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,880
what you think of those claims but it's

215
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,780
becoming a pretty high scale campaign

216
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,380
um

217
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,960
it's

218
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,300
filed materials uh very

219
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,500
um

220
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,020
very negative about African CEO and

221
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,360
anyone who's spoken in favor of Africa

222
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,120
and uh our goal is afternet should be

223
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,500
run transparently we think everyone

224
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,259
should just like every IR should be

225
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,860
uh run by its members uh but it's pretty

226
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,599
hard to have open Fair conduct of an rir

227
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,580
when you have misinformation out there

228
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,080
and we have a little bit of that going

229
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,279
on now in this regard now the nro not

230
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,700
the NRS the nro the five rirs have been

231
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,440
involved and Aaron is one of them I'm

232
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,940
letting you know we're one of the ones

233
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,160
that has been involved in responding to

234
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,779
some of this

235
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,339
um amongst other things

236
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,680
we sent a letter the five are the four

237
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,860
rars not counting Kaepernick to the

238
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,120
Mauritius government

239
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,620
and

240
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,880
we sent a letter to the government

241
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
pointing out that

242
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,700
uh while we do respect the ability of

243
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,500
someone to go to court we don't expect

244
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,420
the a portion of the internet number

245
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,600
registry system to be taken down while

246
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,000
those matters are pending and that to

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,459
some extent uh africanic serves the

248
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,740
entire continent and that may not be

249
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,140
something that is well known or well

250
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,640
understood when you do things like

251
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,820
freeze its bank accounts and so

252
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,040
uh you can find the letter it's uh

253
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,200
Emiliano row website NRL letter to

254
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,060
Mauritius government some people get

255
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,940
very upset that we would tell a

256
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,519
government hey we think you need to pay

257
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
more attention to Africa and understand

258
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,660
it has an operational role in keeping

259
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,980
the internet running

260
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,540
I will tell you I don't feel bad about

261
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,000
that or have any regrets I I think if I

262
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,380
was a government I'd want to know I had

263
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,899
a portion of the rir system running in

264
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,940
my country and that's a pretty important

265
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,980
thing for them to be aware of

266
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,820
um

267
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,800
we've also sent Communications to the

268
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,140
community we've sent out a couple of

269
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,260
blog posts that explain all this uh we

270
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,140
sent out uh the Arias collectively sent

271
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,760
on a message talking about the freezing

272
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,040
of the bank accounts all of this is

273
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,620
still pending uh luckily the com bank

274
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,540
accounts have been unfrozen the

275
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,740
governance matter and having

276
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,779
insufficient Quorum for Africa is still

277
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,180
pending though uh the court cases are

278
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,620
still pending

279
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,839
um I would say we are

280
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,540
uh not stable

281
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,480
but not at high risk it's trending

282
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,940
towards getting better we do expect at

283
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,380
some point that African will have a

284
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,640
functioning board with appointed

285
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,620
directors we'll be able to hold a full

286
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,300
member election to get whatever the

287
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,519
members want for directors we do expect

288
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,440
at some point these cases will

289
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,899
eventually in the courts go through due

290
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,779
process and be settled in the meantime

291
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:58,620
though

292
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,779
you now know what's going on in Africa

293
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,120
in case you're not an African member

294
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,399
um I actually am between you and lunch

295
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,200
so now I just let you go to lunch but

296
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,300
but you'd hate me if I didn't take

297
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,459
questions so I will take a few minutes

298
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:12,959
of questions

299
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,899
any questions on any of this

300
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,660
as I said I may not be able to answer we

301
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,040
don't generally get involved in other

302
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,800
IRS but you you have the right to know

303
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,720
what's going on since it's one internet

304
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,000
number registry system even if it's

305
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,240
spread in five operational pieces

306
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,700
no questions oh come on

307
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,200
I actually expected to get peppered with

308
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,959
these okay last call

309
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,120
I will be here and I will be uh

310
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,560
obviously here through the Aaron meeting

311
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,240
so if you find me in the halls or want

312
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,440
to get me at the iron meeting any point

313
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,060
feel free to come up thank you everyone

314
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:01,560
[Music]

315
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,079
so uh this question might take zero time

316
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,480
we have five rirs because that's how it

317
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,459
made sense to split up the territory of

318
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,820
the globe as the RAR system evolved

319
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,620
have you thought about have you thought

320
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,079
about spinning up a new rir lately and I

321
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,940
appreciate that that's a loaded question

322
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,920
particularly given the distinct lack of

323
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,980
ipv4 address space so we actually have a

324
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,680
great process for creating new rirs it's

325
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,600
documented it's actually a consensus

326
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,120
process that the five rars did adopt

327
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,760
that it's icp2 you can find it

328
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,880
um it was ratified by our collect all

329
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,180
five rirs and then by the icam board so

330
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,399
if a community in a region were to get

331
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,380
organized and where to be supported by

332
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,480
the operators in that region and the

333
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,339
governments then it would be possible to

334
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,980
create a new RAR now what don't we have

335
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,600
well once you're created you have to

336
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,579
make certain to be creative you have to

337
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:57,899
be certain things you have to be

338
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,660
operational you have to have a sign of

339
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,399
support you have to be able to be

340
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,779
self-governed you have to have open

341
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,279
elections you have to operate in Fair

342
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,440
and transparent procedures we do that

343
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,779
and then you're created and then we

344
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,899
never look back there's actually no

345
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,779
review of an rir other than by its

346
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,899
members as to how it's performing and

347
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,459
that's actually one of the claims being

348
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,019
made here is maybe Africa wasn't

349
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,820
performing correctly I don't know I

350
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
think that's a members issue myself but

351
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,399
there are people asking what do we do if

352
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,500
an rir were to get captured for example

353
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,139
an area could lose a lawsuit and end up

354
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,060
being completely a non-membership

355
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,240
organization the next week so the

356
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,779
governance is right now anchored in each

357
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,660
region each region is responsible for

358
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,120
its oversight of its government of its

359
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,019
rir

360
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,519
the question is do we need anything

361
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,399
above that great question do we need the

362
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,800
IRS we did an accountability review each

363
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,019
of us four or five years back we looked

364
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,120
at our bylaws our accountability the

365
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,740
membership you can go to the NRL website

366
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,620
and find that so we've done a few baby

367
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,480
steps in making sure we have good

368
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,579
governance but

369
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,459
um we don't have a systemic

370
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:17,100
solution to how we handle an rir that

371
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,560
ends up unstable we just don't we also

372
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,920
don't have a uniform set of Standards

373
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,380
regarding we have one set at recognition

374
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,380
in icb2 but we have nothing Beyond and

375
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,060
no obligation outside of our own

376
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,240
memberships to talk about our governance

377
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,660
practices now there is an RFC RC 7020

378
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,820
and I might have my authorship on that

379
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,279
okay I have my my hand was in it but I

380
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,240
don't know who ended up being the

381
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,480
authors but 720 is the RFC that

382
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,339
successor of 2050 and 7020 RC says the

383
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:51,959
internet number registry system and how

384
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,060
it's formed and there's a paragraph in

385
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,519
there about evolving the internet number

386
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,060
registry system and it sort of says that

387
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,760
can be done if the community of the

388
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,139
internet number registry system the

389
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,360
community of the 5rrs have something

390
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,100
they want to do and how we change this

391
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,040
and we talk with the other parties who

392
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,500
are the other parties well there's two

393
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,620
of them I can because we use icann to

394
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,720
organize ourselves and I can't has been

395
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,480
involved since the beginning almost the

396
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,060
beginning and the ietf because the ITF

397
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,920
is the source of the numbers those are

398
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,579
both cited so to the extent that we want

399
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,040
to change how the registry system works

400
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,740
something other than five organizations

401
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,860
membership based we want to either add

402
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,260
accountability mechanisms so we want to

403
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,540
have a higher standard or we want to do

404
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,459
anything in that regard it is possible

405
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,680
first the number Community has to come

406
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,660
to consensus and then we have to talk to

407
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,440
our partners and that is in 7020 it's

408
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,480
a very short paragraph though so don't

409
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,240
expect much there uh any follow-up or

410
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,420
any

411
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,820
no uh I think that that's very helpful

412
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,320
thank you I think the only thing I would

413
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,880
say is that and I'll make it clear to

414
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,560
the room that I'm a strong proponent of

415
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,860
the rir system uh is that

416
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,800
um in taking that one paragraph into

417
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,540
consideration I think the top job is

418
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,100
figuring out how to make sure that there

419
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,180
continues to be reasonable uh

420
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,320
customer and network driven access to

421
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,120
Resource to Resource allocation across

422
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,639
the globe in all of its parts Yep

423
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,839
they're great

424
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,760
well that's it if there's no further

425
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,779
questions

426
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,860
thank you for having me

427
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,160
