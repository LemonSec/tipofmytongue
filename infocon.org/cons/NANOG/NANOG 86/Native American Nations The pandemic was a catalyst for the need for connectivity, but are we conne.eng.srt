00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,060
[Music]

2
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,210
foreign

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,460
[Music]

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,400
so I would like to next introduce Matt

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,400
runtana who will be presenting Native

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,040
American nations the pandemic was a

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,079
catalyst for a need for connectivity but

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,940
are we connected yet

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,640
so Matt rentanan is director of

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,180
Technology at Arcadian infracom at the

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,039
Southern California tribal Chairman's

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,420
Association

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,939
of Cree Finnish and Norwegian descent

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,700
Matt is a cyber Warrior for Community

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,980
networking

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,140
and he'll be joining us on the nanoch

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,239
stage for the third time since 2019.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,680
welcome back

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,160
thank you

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,520
hello everyone

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,500
good day let's see am I no I'm not

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,420
keeping you from lunch so is everybody

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,960
awake enough coffee we're good

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,140
look a little slow okay all right try

25
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,640
not to bore you

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,799
um so you know this is an interesting

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,820
statement

28
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,680
um obviously we all felt

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,240
wounded by uh the stay-at-home order and

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,260
went home and if you didn't have

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,640
internet which I can't believe anybody

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,320
in this room doesn't have internet but

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,880
you went home and didn't have internet

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,580
you quickly ordered internet

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,860
um you had probably a cue to wait three

36
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,880
or four weeks to get your internet

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,500
hooked up and then you you know problem

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,140
solved or you know upgrade to your

39
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,900
system well the reservations the 574

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,479
federally recognized Nations uh

41
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,040
predominantly don't have access to

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,860
broadband so

43
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,780
there is some cellular penetration on

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,360
some of the lands there are some small

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,880
wisp providers on some of the lands but

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
predominantly no access to Internet so

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,079
they went home

48
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,079
um if they were able to do remote work

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,700
um they couldn't so they lost their job

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,100
their kids went home and effectively

51
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,740
lost about a year of school so

52
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,520
um

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,100
I'm assuming this is forward

54
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,680
um you're basically uh went home and sat

55
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,060
in a box and tried to figure out how the

56
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,699
hell to solve this problem so a lot of

57
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,080
us who have been building networks with

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,180
Native American communities and being a

59
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,920
part of this

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,520
um

61
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,640
started thinking about

62
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,860
you know how to solve this problem and

63
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,599
how to get around this and and one of

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,520
the issues is that there's 8 000 missing

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,040
middle miles in the lower 48 states so

66
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,540
the networks were built around the

67
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,180
Native American reservations because

68
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,040
um they were obstacles and they slowed

69
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,739
the construction process down so there's

70
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,200
one problem and that's roughly in the

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,940
billion dollar range and then you have

72
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,680
this um

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,959
you know 574 Nations to build a network

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,060
on some are really small some of them

75
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,180
are Navajo which is 27 000 square miles

76
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,440
so you know not one size fits all not

77
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,480
one solution fits all how do you solve

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,180
that okay so that's in maybe the seven

79
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,519
billion dollar range but creeping up

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,000
with inflation and lack of access to

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,599
product uh to construction folks that

82
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,400
aren't already busy things like that

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,900
we've actually probably seen that

84
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,340
increase to maybe a 10 billion dollar

85
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,239
range

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,640
so

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,860
affordable middle mile access is a

88
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,800
missing element you have a sufficient

89
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,659
funding problem so everybody's heard

90
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,159
about the Broadband money that's coming

91
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,599
through Department of Commerce through

92
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,060
ntia the tribal Broadband connectivity

93
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,000
program the iija I don't remember the

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
acronym

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,640
um investment something jobs act and so

96
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,000
you have roughly three billion dollars

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,940
coming through the pipeline so I sort of

98
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,920
laid out the math on about a 10 billion

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,780
dollar problem so we have a third of it

100
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,000
being looked at with the right amount of

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,560
dollars

102
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,780
Last Mile Solutions

103
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,700
um a lot of tribes are getting into this

104
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,980
space because they're being forced the

105
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,900
carriers the existing carriers have been

106
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,519
incentivized by

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,220
the federal government I don't know how

108
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,840
many times but I'm sure it's more than

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
this and they've figured out how not to

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,840
serve that population because it falls

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,720
within a one and a half percent oh I

112
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,620
don't have to serve one and a half

113
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,060
percent of my population only have to

114
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,579
hit 98.5 percent of my population where

115
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,079
I don't have to serve my total

116
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,358
geographic area I only have to serve a

117
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,520
certain percentage well the hard ones

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,199
get left behind and that happens to be

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,560
the tribes tribes are also lacking in in

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,500
some Human Resources right so there are

121
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,180
tribes that have as few as 50 members

122
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,160
there are tribes that have as many as

123
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,960
300 000 members

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,340
but

125
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,160
all of you in this room I'm sure right

126
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,259
now are feeling a little bit of a crunch

127
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,600
in trying to add new staff

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
to your business new qualified technical

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,300
staff to your business well if you're

130
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,800
having trouble think about how hard it

131
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,840
is for Native American folks to bring in

132
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,419
a network administrator or a network

133
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,419
designer or network engineer so those

134
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,820
things are really complicated not to

135
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,040
mention there's a big learning curve

136
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,660
um you know whenever we get access to

137
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,580
something on the reservations

138
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,280
we excel at it so access to gaming we're

139
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,139
doing very well in gaming access to

140
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,000
Green energy doing very well in green

141
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,380
energy

142
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,259
um you know access to broadband okay

143
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,360
we're gonna get really good at it but it

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,180
takes time and with 574 Nations at

145
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,460
different levels of capacity you have

146
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,539
you know

147
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,039
an issue there and then digital

148
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,919
sovereignty this is a question that will

149
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,660
be addressed uh in the coming weeks at

150
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,300
National Congress of American Indians

151
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,880
um there's a bunch of range of of

152
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
digital sovereignty but tribes are

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,539
sovereign Nations trustees is federal

154
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,020
government we have that relationship

155
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,780
um we would like to own our

156
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,639
infrastructure on our tribal land we

157
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,699
don't like to give away that control so

158
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,100
that if carrier a is supplying Services

159
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,100
over our infrastructure and decides to

160
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,320
change their mind about the price or

161
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,000
decide that they want to throttle our

162
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,039
speeds or do something crazy then we

163
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,539
want to be able to shut them off at the

164
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,479
beginning and entice a new carrier to

165
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,500
come in and use the existing

166
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,000
infrastructure and ownership of that

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,060
infrastructure makes that possible

168
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,880
so I'm involved with a whole bunch of

169
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,900
stuff

170
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,160
um I work for the Southern California

171
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,500
tribal Chairman's Association I'm in my

172
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,780
21st I'm actually starting my 22nd year

173
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,419
now as director of technology and that's

174
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,639
25 federally recognized tribes

175
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,039
but I'm currently on loan to the to the

176
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,039
Golden State Network which is

177
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,940
the state of California's SB 156 which

178
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,539
is a bill that introduced 3.25 billion

179
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:43,800
dollars for Middle mile ring

180
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
architecture infrastructure throughout

181
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
the state to connect the unserved and

182
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,160
underserved there are 109 tribes in

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,960
California and I have a relationship

184
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,440
with maybe 50 of them so I was asked to

185
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,000
participate in this effort to make sure

186
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,460
that we didn't drop the ball moving

187
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,960
forward so I am actually doing a lot of

188
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
work with the California tribes right

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,660
now to make sure that they're aligned

190
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,100
with that money

191
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,500
um 600 million more I believe it was it

192
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,720
was added to that pot so we're almost at

193
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,979
four billion dollars building middle

194
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,380
mile infrastructure

195
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm working with

196
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,039
um the department of Technology of

197
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,680
California and then Caltrans as well so

198
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,960
we're identifying opportunity throughout

199
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,120
California for erasing that middle mile

200
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,039
problem I talked about the 8 000 missile

201
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,440
missing miles so California has roughly

202
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,960
1800 of those missing miles so hopefully

203
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,180
this project will erase most of those

204
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,120
1800 miles solve that piece so that the

205
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,220
tribes building their end Network can

206
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,440
then access middle mile at at reasonable

207
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,660
pricing instead of the gouging that

208
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,580
happens today if there is even

209
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,560
connectivity

210
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,199
um I also work with Arcadian infracom we

211
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,460
have representatives in the room here

212
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,280
too building long-haul dark fiber uh

213
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,419
through

214
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,479
um throughout the US so uh the announced

215
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,819
routes currently are Los Angeles to

216
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,520
Dallas using Interstate 40. we are

217
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,380
Phoenix to Salt Lake Phoenix to Denver

218
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,300
we have Partnerships with the Navajo

219
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,819
Southern Ute and many other tribes along

220
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,099
those routes providing back hall

221
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,280
Services lit Services as well as profit

222
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,860
Revenue share and we're trying to set

223
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,900
the standard for

224
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,639
how to currently work with Native

225
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,740
American tribes they are not an obstacle

226
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,860
they're a partner in your path

227
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,680
so then I during covid we had an issue

228
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,120
with

229
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,039
tribes needed training but all the

230
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,958
reservations closed down they didn't

231
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:34,979
want to bring anybody onto the

232
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,539
reservation because the fear of the

233
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,880
pandemic bringing that into a closed

234
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,440
population would be very detrimental to

235
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,580
their health

236
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,979
so they reached out and said hey how do

237
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,959
we do this during during covid what do

238
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,720
we do so we decided my friend

239
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,339
Christopher Mitchell at Institute for

240
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:51,839
local self-reliance some of you know him

241
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,420
and a few others decided that hey let's

242
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,580
hold a tribal Broadband boot camp and

243
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,080
where better to hold that than my house

244
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,399
so I have some land in Southern

245
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,680
California good social distance we can

246
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,779
practice safe you know coveted

247
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,640
restrictions and we can get a bunch of

248
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,320
people there so 29 people showed up my

249
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,080
place and we had this boot camp that was

250
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,519
a success it was funded by internet

251
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,940
society and

252
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,160
gangbusters we had another one

253
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,200
um about I don't know eight months later

254
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,420
and doubled the people

255
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,339
we've since had one on the yurok

256
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,500
reservation one of the University of

257
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,180
Oregon there's another one at my house

258
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,980
in December we're having one at the Gila

259
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,860
River Community next year Arizona state

260
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,380
will host one uh there's going to be one

261
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,839
in New Mexico and then I believe uh the

262
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,880
Hoopa will host one and then we're going

263
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,920
to probably have one in Colville

264
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,080
but it was an opportunity to get tribal

265
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,760
networking folks it's similar to

266
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,860
yourselves right but in the tribal

267
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,660
sphere together to talk about their

268
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,600
issues their Solutions their problems to

269
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,980
be able to create a human Network which

270
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,200
you have here which I would love to

271
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,540
introduce them all to nanog and just

272
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,700
kind of have a big chunk of tribal

273
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,420
networkers show up at nanog but the goal

274
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,920
is to get people together to talk about

275
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,480
Solutions and talk about their problems

276
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,680
and talk about how to work with this

277
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,300
stuff and that's what you do here and

278
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,220
that's what we're kind of doing there so

279
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,800
then tribal resourcecenter.net is a

280
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,940
place where we collect a lot of this

281
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,100
information so tribes can have a space

282
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,560
to go to oh that was awesome

283
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,660
um so the Golden State net I'm just

284
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,980
going to touch on a few of these things

285
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,500
individually 109 federally recognized

286
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,500
tribes 500 that's old 574 now in the U.S

287
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,019
the tribal digital Village network is in

288
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,700
that Circle that's where I've been the

289
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,339
last 21 years building high-speed

290
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,040
wireless network but

291
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,540
realizing now with some of the

292
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,920
opportunity that California is building

293
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,480
out that there's going to be opportunity

294
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,459
for for

295
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,380
um fiber at each of those reservations

296
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,000
and then building Out Wireless from that

297
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,320
fiber or even building fiber to the home

298
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,060
uh this is the Statewide objective you

299
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,620
can find this on their site of

300
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,320
California's Broadband for all

301
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
there's a number of organizations

302
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,140
working together with the governor's

303
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,540
office to try to solve this for almost

304
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,980
four billion dollars is a lot of money

305
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,959
it's not quite enough to do

306
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,040
enough small fiber rings and and uh you

307
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,959
know it's always nice to have more money

308
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,200
but if you think about

309
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,260
how fiber works best ring architecture

310
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,839
overlapping interconnected and spread

311
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,180
out like you know all over the state it

312
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,440
would be nice to make

313
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,240
three or four times as many rings and

314
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,220
make them smaller

315
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,140
um but at least it's a good foundational

316
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,560
start

317
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,060
so the map as presented by the Public

318
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,820
Utilities Commission uh and some of the

319
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,920
other fiber assets and the and the build

320
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,839
out looks about like this obviously some

321
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,399
rings need to be created off of those

322
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,140
Spurs

323
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,180
but you can find this on

324
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,640
online and there's it's updated it's a

325
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,079
live map so it's updated as things

326
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,380
change

327
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,100
and these are the partners that are

328
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,660
working with California in that effort

329
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,000
and you know and I'm trying to make sure

330
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,279
that 109 tribes have access to all of

331
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,120
this

332
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,459
as we move through and so I'll switch

333
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,860
over to Arcadian infracom

334
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,959
because Arcadian is is doing very

335
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,640
similar things to what California is

336
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,160
doing is building long-haul

337
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,860
um fiber opportunities that allow

338
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,740
connectivity throughout the route and

339
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,540
and specifically

340
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,399
designed to build through the places

341
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,160
that haven't been built through yet

342
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,820
um

343
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,980
because they were left behind and

344
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,540
provide opportunity all throughout those

345
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,500
routes so arcadians lines are the blue

346
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
and the red and that is roughly I mean

347
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,940
that's a guesstimation but it's roughly

348
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,620
the fiber map of the United States yes

349
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,660
there's some missing pieces but the

350
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,399
giant holes that you see everywhere are

351
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,100
where the the tribes are nestled right

352
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,139
in the middle of no connectivity

353
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,399
so

354
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,920
The Arcadian route is doing that

355
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,440
which provides a lot of opportunity to

356
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,139
communities throughout those regions for

357
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,320
connectivity it it strengthens obviously

358
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,720
the Navajo in yellow there it

359
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,120
dramatically strengthens the navajos

360
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,920
access to broadband

361
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,740
um both in the the north and west and

362
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,420
all the way to the Northeast and then in

363
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,040
the south

364
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,959
uh if you see in the middle there the

365
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,760
the hole in the middle of Navajo is Hopi

366
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,800
and Hopi will benefit from this as well

367
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,860
and you have you know just just an array

368
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,500
of of different locations in Rural

369
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,540
America that will have access to

370
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,899
broadband

371
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,240
and on the top right uh Arcadian is

372
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,680
building uh we're building over Wolf

373
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,019
Creek Pass right now and there's our uh

374
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,000
first uh hand hold there with our

375
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,399
Arcadian logo which is kind of cool

376
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,300
um

377
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,920
Wolf Creek Pass I don't know if anybody

378
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,660
knows it in Colorado but is not as a

379
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,160
nightmare build it's a two-year build

380
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,040
it's it's probably almost Frozen by now

381
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,899
maybe by the end of the day it'll be

382
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,160
frozen they won't be able to build till

383
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,740
next year but it is uh is an amazing

384
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,600
place to cross across the Continental

385
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,399
divine

386
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,139
so jumping into the tribal Broadband

387
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,180
boot camps I

388
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,459
I think you should go there and watch

389
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,680
that video it's a lot of fun you get a

390
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,260
lot of testimonial from from what people

391
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,060
have been able to do uh getting together

392
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,420
and talking about networking

393
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,980
you know

394
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,560
um experiencing

395
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,500
I think camaraderie uh in the networking

396
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,180
space is which they don't have a lot of

397
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,279
people are operating in a silo

398
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,459
they don't have access to somebody else

399
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,200
doing the same thing they don't realize

400
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,260
that they're um have very similar

401
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,360
problem sets than their neighbors

402
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,459
they're tribal neighbors uh in one

403
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,320
situation and I wish I would have thrown

404
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,440
this picture in the slides but the yurok

405
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,459
the hoopa and the karuk tribes

406
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,740
um for the first time

407
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,019
as far as the technologist people said

408
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,240
uh in their in their history in their

409
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,620
lifetime history are working together

410
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,639
now at home and they took a picture

411
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,940
of a router on a pole as if it were the

412
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,680
flag at Iwo Jima and they were all

413
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,720
holding the flag up

414
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,040
um and it was pretty cool they did that

415
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,920
at my place and it became sort of a

416
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,440
an icon for their you know their builds

417
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,180
uh they're they're all building networks

418
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,060
both the yurok and the Hupa tribe got um

419
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,500
in the neighborhood of 70 million

420
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,839
dollars from the ntia funding to build

421
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,120
out their their infrastructure which

422
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,500
will dramatically change the

423
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,480
opportunities in the region and they

424
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,519
learned a lot of what they needed to do

425
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,399
here at this boot camp they learned it

426
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,139
more of the language they learned how to

427
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,180
communicate to their tribal leadership

428
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,040
in terms that the leadership would

429
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,500
understand they learned how to frame

430
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,540
some of the issues

431
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,740
um when they were talking to the federal

432
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,940
government they learned how to frame

433
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,899
some of the issues when they were

434
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,940
talking to their people

435
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,820
so it was one of those situations where

436
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,680
now they have this network of people

437
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,660
that they continue to to talk to each

438
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,180
other on a on an online platform and I

439
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,339
see that the transmission go going by

440
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,860
and I just get to watch every part of

441
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,480
the conversation I'm just excited that

442
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,060
I'm not the middleman anymore and

443
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,500
there's so much wonderful things

444
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,060
happening and solutions being slinged

445
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,320
left and right it's just it's really

446
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,480
cool

447
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,139
so

448
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,300
we had one of the Godfathers himself

449
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,100
show up to the boot camp at University

450
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,519
of Oregon uh Vince Dr Vince Cerf

451
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,440
and uh

452
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,899
we had a really great turnout we had 54

453
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,820
people show up at the University of

454
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,579
Oregon and got trained in fiber splicing

455
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,660
fiber management Wireless Communications

456
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,579
we set up uh remote links on the campus

457
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,759
and um you know Connected Wireless links

458
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,139
and showed traffic routing and different

459
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,880
things like that

460
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,519
um nsrc Network startup Resource Center

461
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,399
I was very gracious in donating a bunch

462
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,639
of equipment and educational time uh

463
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,079
through their people through Dale Smith

464
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,839
and and we had Bob Stovall there from uh

465
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,000
from Merit Network in Michigan uh

466
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,100
teaching some of the fiber splicing so

467
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,540
we had a really good well-rounded crew

468
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,319
um

469
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,079
very engaging process and and just you

470
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,839
know a absolute success so we're excited

471
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,280
to

472
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,880
um

473
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,339
we're really excited to continue this

474
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,859
process and maybe invite some of you to

475
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,020
actually come in and guest speak at at

476
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,760
some of these boot camps to talk about

477
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,260
the different types of networks that

478
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,919
exist and what you're working on

479
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,559
you can see folks here working on

480
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,240
um you know different aspects of of the

481
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,380
fiber

482
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,220
Solutions

483
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,120

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,120
center.net

485
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,460
uh this started under people-centered

486
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,679
internet uh Vince surf is was the chair

487
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,720
with May Lin Fung

488
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,179
um they started this organization

489
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,220
um obviously people-centered internet

490
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,620
um to focus on that aspect of things and

491
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,660
I became uh sort of the tribal lead

492
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,559
there

493
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,679
um helping vent place money with um with

494
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,900
Native American projects uh to advance

495
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,240
uh you know obviously Broadband in in

496
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,100
the tribal space

497
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,440
what we grew this into

498
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,860
with internet Society Foundation money

499
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,660
was a resource center that allowed

500
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,980
people to

501
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,880
um

502
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,620
kind of a One-Stop shop for the things

503
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,720
you need to know about networking

504
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,480
and to try to wrap your head around this

505
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,039
project that you now are having to take

506
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,900
on because nobody else will serve your

507
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,700
community so this is sort of a starting

508
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,220
point it ranges from

509
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,140
so you want to build a network

510
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,660
um here's here's how you start to you

511
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,220
don't want to build a network but you

512
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,660
need to entice somebody to come in to

513
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,640
build a network and here's where you

514
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,860
start to you already have a network but

515
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,299
you want your network to be better so

516
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,760
and then all of the things in between so

517
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,460
with this you know we are looking for

518
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,980
resources training videos opportunities

519
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,440
to work with any and all of your

520
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,960
networks to be able to support these

521
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,000
native communities in in teaching and

522
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,340
training so we're trying to gather or

523
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,980
link to great opportunities that exist

524
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,780
for the Native American communities to

525
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,520
be able to use this as a One-Stop shop

526
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,059
so Federal funding streams

527
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,059
um

528
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,500
I'm going to touch on this a little bit

529
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,720
so we talked a little bit about in the

530
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,940
beginning where it's we roughly have a

531
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,220
10 billion dollar problem

532
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,020
um for the for the connectivity for the

533
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,600
home on the Indian reservations and we

534
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,500
have

535
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,900
um you know the lower 48 is it is a

536
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,700
unique animal and there's a bunch of

537
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,120
variety there Alaska is a another

538
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,280
horribly different situation with lack

539
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,260
of middle mile connectivity dramatic

540
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,860
lack of services and opportunities and

541
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,140
then you have Hawaii which you know has

542
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,900
been in turmoil a couple times misuse of

543
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,360
funds and a few mismanagements um and

544
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,820
then so it's kind of a hotbed hot mess

545
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,160
Federal funding came out

546
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,260
through to the cares act funding the

547
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,299
iija funding the tribal Broadband

548
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,039
connectivity program

549
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,679
uh treasury has money our U.S has money

550
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,559
USDA and a few others and they're trying

551
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,440
to get enough access to that funding for

552
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,520
tribes

553
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,120
to operate build uh successfully solve

554
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,120
this internet problem

555
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,020
and as we discussed

556
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,340
um I'm going to throw these up there

557
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,020
because these are more fun

558
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,679
um

559
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,720
as we discussed there isn't quite enough

560
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,600
so maybe we're at a third of that

561
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,860
solution where's the rest of that money

562
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,320
going to come from these networks don't

563
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,760
have a lot of return on investment

564
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,140
because there's not a huge population

565
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,620
base so you know understandably the

566
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,600
carriers that were incentivized multiple

567
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,700
times to get there never wanted to build

568
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,900
them out because there's not a big

569
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,220
return on that investment on that

570
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,559
infrastructure but now that we are

571
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,760
building

572
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,620
the infrastructure to get to our

573
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,500
reservation it should be a lot lower or

574
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,260
a lot lighter lift for those that are

575
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,700
carriers that could serve our

576
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,980
communities to come in and build off the

577
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,160
end of that that uh middle mile

578
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,360
connectivity

579
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,460
to actually help us out and and maybe

580
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,960
there's a return on investment there

581
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,220
because the balance is a little better

582
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,360
because they haven't dumped all the

583
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,179
money into the into the middle mile

584
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:18,179
maybe not but

585
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,980
tribes are out there building in places

586
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,440
that don't have power

587
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,780
um and we would like you know to to work

588
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,260
with organizations that that provide a

589
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,940
level of support some of the tribes want

590
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,559
to run this themselves some of the

591
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,240
tribes absolutely don't want outside

592
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,640
influence some of the tribes are are

593
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,580
willing to sign a deal with you know one

594
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,860
of the colors blue red yellow carriers

595
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,780
and say

596
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,400
yeah you do it

597
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,620
um we don't care you know just get

598
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,720
internet to the people some of the

599
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,760
tribes absolutely don't want another

600
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,760
ounce of participation from anyone and

601
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,080
they want to do it themselves so they're

602
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,940
learning how to do this

603
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,440
um the tribal digital Village network is

604
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,900
a good example of that but we're seeing

605
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,640
the tribal digital Village Network in

606
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,919
this day and age start to come apart a

607
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,059
little bit because it is a wireless

608
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,640
solution as we all know Wireless

609
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,580
is awesome but Wireless doesn't scale

610
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,900
like fiber

611
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,480
so at the point where you have four

612
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,039
people in a household two of them on

613
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,240
school two of them trying to work

614
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,520
remotely all at the same time doing

615
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,919
video conferencing we've seen the

616
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,900
limitations of our wireless network get

617
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,220
strained

618
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,039
so how do we do fiber to the home how do

619
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,020
we get

620
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,780
um you know more bandwidth and more

621
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,480
capacity to each individual

622
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,100
how do we get

623
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,640
um

624
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,580
a network design

625
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,980
that we can trust

626
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,320
to be the right solution for our

627
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,740
communities when you know when you drop

628
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,360
three billion dollars in the water

629
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,480
there's a lot of sharks right so how do

630
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,919
we you know how do we vet those people

631
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,960
that are you know coming to us and

632
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,120
saying oh we can we got the solution for

633
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,740
your reservation we got this figured out

634
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,960
tribes have heard that for a long time

635
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,679
so you know if you have those levels of

636
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,780
capacity in your

637
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,880
you know vast community of folks that

638
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,679
are that are doing these things we'd

639
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,600
love to engage

640
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,120
um on that level with you uh to better

641
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,580
understand solutions for our communities

642
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,400
and work together devising that solution

643
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,559
rather than being told how to solve our

644
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,760
problem

645
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,658
so

646
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,880
another thing I wanted to just touch

647
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,460
about real fast is uh the Spectrum issue

648
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,659
I've got a bit of time left so

649
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,520
um some of you may be aware that there

650
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,799
was a tribal Broadband or a tribal

651
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,020
priority window for spectrum at the

652
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,940
Federal Communications Commission in the

653
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,120
2.5 gigahertz which was EBS educational

654
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,419
broadcast it was uh recalled for I don't

655
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,140
know if it was misuse or unintended use

656
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,480
and we were able to apply the tribal

657
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,580
priority window for tribes to opt in to

658
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,860
the license over their land

659
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,419
so

660
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,700
to be able to to do this we need tools

661
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,620
right we need the tools of the trade and

662
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,059
spectrum is one of those tools of the

663
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,700
trade but it's very expensive

664
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,679
carriers aren't intending to serve over

665
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,840
tribal lands so tribes would very much

666
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,539
like to be a part of

667
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,460
the group that has a toolbox full of

668
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,500
tools so when that opportunity came up

669
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,260
um tribes were very eager to get a piece

670
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,360
of this uh

671
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,299
piece of the toolbox and the FCC

672
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,980
projected that there would only be 12

673
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,020
applications

674
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,860
for the tribal priority window and 2.5

675
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,559
there were over 400 and about 400

676
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,480
licenses have been given and what

677
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,280
there's a there's a misunderstanding

678
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,580
about the value of a full power FCC

679
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,380
license

680
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,000
what do you use it for you we use it to

681
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,159
build networking right guess what tribes

682
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,679
also use it for a bankable asset to

683
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,059
borrow money to build that Network

684
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,100
because tribes don't have access to

685
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,200
bankable assets you cannot repossess

686
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,720
Sovereign land the bank can't come take

687
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,820
your land away because it is held in

688
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,320
trust by the federal government for your

689
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,840
tribe so they don't have land to put up

690
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,159
as collateral so they don't have very

691
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,380
much stuff that they can say hey

692
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,940
you know we want to borrow some money

693
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,520
what do you have as collateral well

694
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,620
um uh you know we don't have this land

695
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,539
we don't have a lot of things

696
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,980
um so so this was the first time we

697
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,840
actually got access to something that we

698
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,760
could actually put up as collateral so

699
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,299
it was sort of a key ingredient in some

700
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,799
of these smaller tribes being able to

701
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,440
build out their Network get funding all

702
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,779
at once to be able to solve the problem

703
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,419
so we are very interested in any time

704
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,220
that Spectrum moves

705
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,020
to be able to have a tribal priority

706
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,059
window to be able to get that for our

707
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,760
reservations not for non-reservation

708
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,500
land but for our reservations we want to

709
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,480
be able to use those tools to serve our

710
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,279
community

711
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,020
and I think that's the last of my slide

712
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,360
deck and I'm a little bit short

713
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,080
on presentation but I um

714
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,059
I feel like there's an opportunity to

715
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,980
maybe have a discussion if if we have

716
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,720
any questions in the crowd and I would

717
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,159
like to queue up

718
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,340
those microphones if I could

719
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,279
and get rolling there uh so your

720
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,320
discussion was very fiber-centric but as

721
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,179
you mentioned a lot of these areas the

722
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,360
terrain is very challenging right and so

723
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,580
um how deep is the discussion currently

724
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:35,100
with private 5G on at reservations and

725
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,380
is there consideration of using cbrs

726
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,659
Spectrum for instance thank you actually

727
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:42,299
that is very hot topic right now it will

728
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,039
be addressed I think there's actually a

729
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,600
track at the indigenous connectivity

730
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,940
Summit coming up in Winnipeg

731
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,679
specifically talking about private 5G

732
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,460
networks cbrs is a very

733
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,120
um attractive space for tribes to use

734
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,799
a little bit more lenient in some of the

735
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,020
rule making process and such so yes it

736
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,840
is absolutely uh a focus of some of the

737
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,520
reservations especially if they have

738
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,779
bigger land mass

739
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:09,000
so thank you

740
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,159
Tom strix clefler um thanks a lot for

741
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,960
that talk it's super interesting

742
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,460
um I was wondering what you would think

743
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,100
is the most unique challenge currently

744
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,039
experienced by Native American Networks

745
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,960
most unique challenge well

746
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:29,100
uh that's really there's not enough of

747
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,600
us doing this

748
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,620
um

749
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,140
you know I could count both hands

750
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,940
probably that the amount of people that

751
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,679
are engaging

752
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,659
prior to prior to this last couple of

753
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,580
years there was probably only 10 of us

754
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,320
that were fighting these policy battles

755
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,000
and and doing that stuff and it's always

756
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,179
the same same Usual Suspects doing the

757
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,740
work uh in the last couple of years

758
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,539
because I think the pandemic we've been

759
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,480
able to increase our numbers and and

760
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,220
sort of educate some of those that have

761
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,020
been following along

762
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,600
um because you know there's a lot to be

763
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,460
done and with just a handful of us

764
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,140
actually being out there and advocating

765
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,000
and such it's really hard to cover all

766
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,100
the bases and and to get to places like

767
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,020
this which you know sort of overlap but

768
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,940
not really you know sometimes it makes

769
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,799
sense sometimes it doesn't we want to

770
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,059
make sure that we are having this

771
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,740
conversation everywhere that matters to

772
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,539
us and this is a great room to have this

773
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,820
conversation but I think it's it's tough

774
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,559
there's just not enough people engaged

775
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,299
in this space I think

776
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,400
now that we saw over 400 applications

777
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,620
for the travel priority window for for

778
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,380
the wireless Spectrum some of the you

779
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,760
know some of the money that's coming now

780
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,679
as tribes are actually engaging and

781
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,059
building departments around this I think

782
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,740
we're going to see more advocacy and I I

783
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,940
think that'll actually increase the

784
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,620
opportunity but until now it's probably

785
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,860
been just a lack of people uh to be able

786
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,240
to do this work so thank you

787
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,100
Andrew Dahl um I had a question about

788
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,159
what from this community would you like

789
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,919
to see more of

790
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:01,919
what other than being aware right right

791
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,720
we're aware because you're here and

792
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,720
that's great so what interactions and

793
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,580
what how can this community better

794
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,740
support you and your work I guess it may

795
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,900
be a better question yeah

796
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,059
um so that's a it's a good question

797
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,580
because I've I've never been very good

798
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,260
at figuring out

799
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,299
how

800
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,820
to like transplant you into the

801
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,500
reservation for a few minutes and and

802
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,120
tap into your

803
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,700
you know expertise if it were you know

804
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,919
on that level I've not been able to

805
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,539
figure I've had a lot of offers from a

806
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,520
lot of different organizations and I you

807
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,039
know we don't code we don't do certain

808
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,799
things we I think what we need to do is

809
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,500
um maybe integrate folks

810
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,539
um from this community maybe into the

811
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,059
Broadband boot camps where we can

812
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,220
showcase some of the cool work that you

813
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,620
do and and some of the you know some of

814
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,320
what that looks like specifically

815
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,820
um that may translate to a community

816
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,279
Network or what actually looks more like

817
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,020
a municipal Network

818
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,340
um for a try because it's government

819
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,860
owned it's it owns the economic

820
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,080
development the education everything

821
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,600
that lives on the one network so maybe

822
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,580
it's something where we can kind of tap

823
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,220
into that expertise and have showcases

824
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,080
at the tribal Broadband boot camps where

825
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,940
we can you know capture that on video

826
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,980
and then have that encapsulated in time

827
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,140
for you know for people to see maybe

828
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,460
that's a start

829
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,840
um but I would love to work with you

830
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,640
I'll give you my card afterwards and and

831
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,440
figure out how we can make some of that

832
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,580
happen

833
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,559
thank you

834
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,679
Dave Siegel Siegel Group LLC

835
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,720
um so it looked like your presentation

836
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,360
focused a lot on uh like the last mile

837
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,880
basically uh I apologize I missed the

838
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,200
first part so maybe you went into this

839
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,399
but yeah

840
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,380
um there's obviously a lot of funding in

841
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,299
California going to Golden State Network

842
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,820
yeah I just I did do that the whole

843
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,919
first half of the presentation was that

844
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,820
so are the my question is I apologize if

845
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,520
this is retreading don't worry

846
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,260
is there been enough planning to make

847
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,640
sure that the middle mile network is

848
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,679
actually going and getting to the

849
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,299
reserve each of the reservations that

850
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,580
need the access or is that still largely

851
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,260
an unsolved problem in terms of funding

852
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,000
to not only take the Last Mile and get

853
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,980
it to some place that can get it to the

854
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,940
internet

855
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,220
so yeah I don't know if you caught the

856
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,659
fact that I actually am the tribal

857
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,820
liaison for Golden State Network

858
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,039
I'm actually working with them to to

859
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,740
work with 109 tribes so

860
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,500
um I am doing my best to reach out to

861
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,279
all 109 tribes the guidance initially

862
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,799
was to stay on Caltrans right away

863
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,960
so the Caltrans right away doesn't reach

864
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,200
every single tribe but it gets close so

865
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,340
um I am working with each of those

866
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,860
tribes to identify how close that

867
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,200
opportunity is what that solution might

868
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,419
look like in their eyes and how to work

869
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:50,340
together to devise the proper solution

870
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,200
to make sure that they're a part of that

871
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,899
that Network and then also then looking

872
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,820
forward to identify funding that would

873
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,399
bridge the gap if they are not on the

874
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:01,320
Caltrans right away all right so sounds

875
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,000
good catch me later thank you

876
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,460
yes Denise

877
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,919
Denise with Arcadian and I appreciate

878
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,620
Matt um this interaction I wanted to

879
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,080
speak to a question that was asked about

880
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,419
a unique challenge

881
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:20,279
um not being from the Native American

882
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,919
Community but working with arcading and

883
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,799
seeing how that interaction is two words

884
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,380
just came to mind when he said that and

885
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,100
that was integrity and trust you know

886
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,720
that's people that have been in the

887
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,059
business space for a long time we tend

888
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,980
to do business with people that we trust

889
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,140
we tend to do business with people that

890
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,960
you know we move around in the industry

891
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,140
and you know you you get your your tribe

892
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,080
your group right networking folks and

893
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,960
you keep doing business with them is so

894
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,840
interesting to me the trust that has

895
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,320
been built up from a small group of

896
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,140
people to bring things like this to the

897
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,380
Forefront and I think expanding on that

898
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,080
is really important so you know the

899
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,940
other question that was asked is what

900
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,299
can we what what could this group do and

901
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,899
I think expanding that in little ways

902
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:19,200
because trust is built over a period of

903
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,320
time it's built over keeping your word

904
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,380
it's built over you know giving back and

905
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,899
so that's been a really interesting

906
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:31,380
process for me to watch coming from the

907
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,380
business space right but then moving on

908
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,200
into this other space as well yeah I

909
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,179
think what we see so

910
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,640
the tribal networking folks the tribal

911
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,740
I.T directors and and Broadband

912
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,960
directors of the tribes are fans of a

913
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,399
lot of your networks right they watch

914
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,080
what you do they watch how you build

915
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,360
your networks they you know they look at

916
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,580
your products they look at you know your

917
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,260
services and they think wow this would

918
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,760
be really cool to have

919
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,220
you know for Indian country and how do

920
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,840
we convert that and make that part of

921
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,860
Indian country

922
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,919
so there is already a level of respect

923
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,380
between the tribal networking community

924
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,320
and your nanog community right and the

925
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,899
individual work that you do because we

926
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,239
see the value of what you do and we

927
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,219
probably use your services every day if

928
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,839
we have access to Internet

929
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,879
so there is already a level of that

930
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,300
trust and it would be nice to expand

931
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,040
upon that and like the gentleman said

932
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,359
you know

933
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,520
open up opportunities to engage with

934
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,379
some of your expertise and your

935
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:34,020
engineers and and you know your thinkers

936
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,599
about how to solve some of our problems

937
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,179
together and and make better

938
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,619
better Solutions

939
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,780
sorry hey we've got a question from

940
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,639
online are you seeing any similar issues

941
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,099
in Pacific Northwest tribes in Northwest

942
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,199
tribes Pacific Northwest Pacific

943
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,679
Northwest uh yeah so

944
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,119
um we are actually going to be doing one

945
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,560
of the Broadband boot camps on the

946
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,540
Colville reservation

947
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,599
um and we've had several uh several

948
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,520
folks we had I think we had all nine of

949
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,020
the Oregon tribes represented at the

950
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,359
boot camp in in the Oregon University of

951
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,160
Oregon boot camp that we did

952
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,000
um

953
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,859
so you know some of those tribes have

954
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,540
gotten this you know similar funding

955
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,339
some of those tribes didn't get funding

956
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,260
some of those tribes got access to the

957
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,359
tribal priority window and 2.5 gigahertz

958
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,500
some didn't

959
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,200
they're all interested in building out

960
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,880
networks they're all interested in

961
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,460
dissolving old problematic relationships

962
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,680
with carriers that don't really serve

963
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,900
the communities and expanding upon the

964
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,740
new opportunities and growth so um

965
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,099
the atni which is the Affiliated tribes

966
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,760
of the Northwest Indians is very active

967
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,400
they have a track that is related to

968
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,140
technology and Broadband at their

969
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,880
Summits and I think they have two or

970
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,940
three a year and each of those Summits

971
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,040
addresses the issues as a collective and

972
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,599
then they individually work on problems

973
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,000
some work together on problems which is

974
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,800
great they have some really strong

975
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,420
leaders there they have Valerie fast

976
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,400
horse who runs Red Spectrum at Coeur

977
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,480
d'Alene

978
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,640
and they have Danae Wilson who just took

979
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,140
the Broadband director of The Office of

980
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,880
the President of the United States from

981
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,000
the Nez Perce tribe and she has left

982
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,520
behind her network for for a period of

983
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,920
time to support the nation so they have

984
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,420
a really strong leadership there in the

985
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,760
Broadband space and

986
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,440
um they have a gentleman named Ernie

987
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,260
Rasmussen who just joined the Colville

988
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,579
efforts in building things out I worked

989
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:29,339
with Folks at the Spokane and they are

990
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,079
sort of unifying around this this

991
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,820
opportunity to build out Broadband so

992
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,300
the Pacific Northwest is is

993
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,579
live and functional in this space

994
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,260
yes

995
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,079
hi my name is Kendra my company just

996
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,880
recently moved into the Phoenix Arizona

997
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,800
footprint and we're actually working

998
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,640
with Gila Valley currently and we

999
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,619
ourselves are trying to figure out how

1000
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,240
that was so I just wanted to thank you

1001
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,760
it was extremely informative and I would

1002
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,160
love to see again how we can support

1003
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,700
some of the tribal land in Arizona

1004
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,339
um so I would love to think speak with

1005
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:09,839

1006
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,119
so informative and good websites for me

1007
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,339
to be able to look at and kind of see

1008
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:15,900
what other opportunities we could do

1009
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,520
we're doing some middle mile stuff down

1010
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,800
in the Tucson area because again it's an

1011
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,599
underserved market and we're aware of

1012
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,160
that so absolutely thank you so much

1013
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,879
