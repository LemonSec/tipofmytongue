Harlan welcome to the nanog stage

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,700
thank you very much

41
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,939
[Applause]

42
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,100
I'm very glad to be here thank you all

43
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,899
very much

44
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,759
I think I start with this

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,060
so I call it my hallucination because

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,000
sometime in the 80s or 90s I was reading

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
uh some of the books by bandler and

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,720
grinder about neuro-linguistic

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,800
programming

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,860
and I understood them to say each of us

51
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,420
really lives on our own who

52
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,739
hallucinations

53
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,959
and their point is they're really I'm

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,819
only trying to do this very rarely

55
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,640
because I know y'all can read they're

56
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,200
really only two distinctions between

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
anybody in this room and an

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,239
institutionalized schizophrenic one of

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,980
them has to do with whether or not you

60
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,319
have a good reality strategy and you can

61
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,420
make that distinction and the second is

62
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,340
whether or not the content of your

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,280
hallucinations is socially acceptable

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,060
and uh or not and because you all

65
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,099
hallucinate we hallucinate that

66
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,720
somebody's having a good day or a bad

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,980
day uh and it really isn't sometimes

68
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,720
it's an accurate representation of

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,580
what's going on and sometimes it's not

70
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,180
but it isn't necessarily real

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,379
so

72
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,660
I noticed on the one hand I kind of like

73
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,780
these definitions but and I mostly

74
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,340
agreed with them but on the other hand

75
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,200
they felt off to me because it's really

76
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,360
a matter of perspective I wondered if

77
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,500
there might be a better word than

78
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,599
hallucination

79
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
so I thought about delusions and then I

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,519
looked at the definition of these things

81
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,920
a Hallucination is an experience

82
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,620
involving the apparent perception of

83
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,440
something which is not present

84
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,680
and that edges me a bit and a delusion

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,739
is an India static idiosyncratic belief

86
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,580
or impression that is firmly maintained

87
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,040
etc etc but the point is I don't really

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,019
like either of these things in the first

89
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,000
one I'm not thrilled with the apparent

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,400
perception because I don't believe I

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,620
have a level of awareness to know what

92
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,200
is perceivable by other folks then a lot

93
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,440
of times I miss perceiving things myself

94
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,239
and in the second one I don't really

95
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,500
like it because generally accepted as as

96
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,099
reality or a rational argument it seems

97
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:07,200
bluntly irresponsible to me I'm not in a

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,000
position to know this stuff

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,879
so let me

100
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,680
clear this out a little bit to make it

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
easier

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,500
so

103
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,440
I'll have to try here

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,959
the General accepted reality is there

105
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,360
and the reason why I say this is a Lie

106
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,400
Is A Lie even if everybody believes it

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,680
and the truth is the truth even if

108
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,660
nobody believes it so this goes to the

109
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,580
sort of stuff I'm having trouble with I

110
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,500
still think about this a fair amount

111
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,840
words and language are important to me

112
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,880
because it goes to

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,300
how we communicate with each other and

114
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,880
how we then the communication between

115
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,740
folks and then the understanding we have

116
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,840
to go and then build upon it

117
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,259
so this Clarity increased for me when I

118
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,440
heard the phrase communication is the

119
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,139
effect it has on the other person

120
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,740
that one really hit home to me

121
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,880
especially when I

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
like most everybody else I know can feel

123
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
so misunderstood when I say something

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,139
that is so clear and obvious to me and I

125
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,580
get a deer in the headlights from

126
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,139
somebody else

127
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,419
I also like to be amused and I like to

128
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,258
amuse others

129
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,360
we should be hearing sounds

130
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,280
isolation is secretion of the four Helio

131
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,919
lobe the four hedial lobe for Helio

132
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,240
gland whatever it is the gland I've

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,880
discovered in the forehead oh

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,199
you did that

135
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,880
well that's good

136
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,220
yes yes but now I've extracted what it's

137
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,199
secretes or excrete and what does it

138
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,479
secrete or excrete

139
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,639
let's call it for now for had a scene

140
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,479
so that clip uh I got permission I won't

141
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,340
say what I said up there but you know

142
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,380
thank you and I'm glad I was able to use

143
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,639
it

144
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,199
um all right

145
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,660
to prep for this talk I asked them about

146
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,400
what language is appropriate for me to

147
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,479
use up here

148
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,360
and we had some discussions around it

149
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,100
and sadly the first thing that came to

150
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,960
my mind is what movie rating am I

151
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,120
striving for and as soon as those words

152
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,460
came out of my mouth I realized I

153
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,139
shouldn't have said that because I don't

154
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,759
know what language is appropriate for my

155
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,039
movie ratings anymore I haven't thought

156
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,620
about that for a movie I've watched in a

157
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,699
long time

158
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,539
so the feedback I got was

159
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,699
I was told it was okay to say the word

160
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,280
sucks which is good because I'm happy to

161
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,240
use that word frequently and I could say

162
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,800
F-bomb but I couldn't say the actual

163
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,819
word

164
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,460
and I was also told I should avoid avoid

165
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,919
both sexual innuendo

166
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,160
and I should also avoid violence

167
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,180
and on the violence thing my when I

168
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,280
heard avoid violence the first thing I

169
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,440
go to is well what's a violent thing I

170
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,479
would possibly say and the one that

171
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,160
popped into my head was the phrase about

172
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,539
two birds

173
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,000
and I realized yes that's clearly

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,060
violent and other folks have said that

175
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,759
it's violent too and they recommended uh

176
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,580
let's see where am I

177
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,100
now let's try it here the phrase the

178
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,319
phrase feed two birds with one scone is

179
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,900
is certainly less violent than the other

180
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,080
one

181
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,400
what about gluten intolerant Birds

182
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,039
I mean sooner or later you go down this

183
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,840
path you see new things you make new

184
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,460
choices you got to decide what's okay

185
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,199
and what wasn't and what was okay

186
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,840
yesterday is not okay today

187
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,940
so you got to figure out

188
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,699
is all about boundary exploration and

189
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,380
how do you titrate these boundaries to

190
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,599
see where they are but before you can do

191
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,580
that you have to actually identify what

192
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,860
the new boundary conditions are it's

193
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,199
it's a thing

194
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,440
so with that in mind

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,720
um there is a point to what I've been

196
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,520
saying and with any luck it'll start to

197
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,840
become clear

198
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,500
for me the goal and Dave Mills because I

199
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,259
asked him about that people assume ntp

200
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,840
is about setting the clocks which is

201
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,900
true but it has to maintain the time and

202
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,720
when I asked Dave for a quick summary of

203
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,199
what is the actual core goal of ntp he

204
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,780
said ntp is all about a well-defined

205
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,639
response to an impulse

206
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,120
and that impulse is changing the time

207
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,120
so that could be a slight adjustment or

208
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,520
if you wake up and say gee whiz my clock

209
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,320
is wrong I'm going to jump it ahead I'm

210
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,659
going to make a big step on it so the

211
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,260
overall philosophy on this is we do the

212
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,260
right things in the right places not too

213
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,279
much not too little it's doing

214
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,620
it's taking a high level overview to

215
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,180
make sure the things you do are

216
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,360
generally correct because as you get a

217
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,940
bigger system of systems trying to

218
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,339
communicate back and forth about time as

219
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,920
Dave has learned through Decades of

220
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,339
painful experience as he will say all of

221
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,380
a sudden somebody does a little

222
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,519
something and the next thing you know

223
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,700
the wheels fly off the bus

224
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,080
so

225
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,080
to me it's sort of like this this is a

226
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,120
tensegrity structure

227
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,680
and

228
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,680
that's clean it's simple

229
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,800
and there's parts that just manage to

230
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,600
make the right thing happen if anything

231
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,240
is too weak or too heavy

232
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,060
or does the wrong thing it's not going

233
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,939
to stay up and and time is all about

234
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,800
my take on time which happens to

235
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
apparently match with Dave's is you've

236
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,100
got to do these things in the right way

237
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,800
just to make sure things stay and behave

238
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,240
in the general case

239
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,740
so starting off on me this is the 1960s

240
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,680
for me so I was younger if you can

241
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,000
believe that

242
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,760
uh

243
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,160
I was hyper Vigilant I learned to be

244
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,920
hyper Vigilant at a very young age and

245
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,440
just to be clear I paid attention to

246
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,500
everything I if I was in a room with

247
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,420
folks I knew where all the stuff was in

248
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,339
the room I know who walked in the room I

249
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,399
memorized their clothing uh I knew the

250
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,300
sounds

251
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,480
I was hyper Vigilant about everything I

252
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,779
also had a really great memory and that

253
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,920
was cultivated because

254
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,060
well bluntly it was a survival technique

255
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,380
for me it's how I wanted to you know

256
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,880
move through the day and not get into

257
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
trouble and be appreciated and all the

258
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,680
rest of it so that was a a thing for me

259
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,440
I also learned to be pretty intuitive

260
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,380
uh I'm introverted believe it or not my

261
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,300
idea of a good time is not being around

262
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,579
people

263
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,459
um along with uh I tried to find

264
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,380
patterns and connections with everything

265
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,779
because if I could find patterns and

266
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,640
connections with stuff I could figure

267
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,440
out how it was put together I could

268
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,180
predict how things were going to react

269
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,579
and I could then move forward and have a

270
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,220
successful experience with something

271
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,540
I did if I came across a behavior that

272
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,880
didn't fit my built up model I just paid

273
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,480
more attention got more information and

274
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,399
if I adjusted my model that meant I just

275
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,899
dismantled the old one and installed the

276
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,579
new one and I would move forward from

277
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,740
that location at that point on it's

278
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,560
effectively an exercise in

279
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,140
tweaking local a locally optimal

280
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,959
solution for all sorts of fun things

281
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,360
I did a lot of reading when I was a kid

282
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,820
and I continued that I was able to keep

283
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,160
reading for pleasure until well into my

284
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,839
40s

285
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,579
um if I had more

286
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,000
if I was doing less work

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,279
then I'd be have even more time and I

288
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,779
keep doing reading but that hasn't

289
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,760
happened in a while

290
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,380
um there was a time in my early high

291
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,380
school days where I kind of ran out of

292
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,600
stuff to read and my folks had bought a

293
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,720
22 volume encyclopedia so I read all of

294
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,399
it cover to cover

295
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,120
and uh I have a memory so I people would

296
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,220
say things and I'd flash back to the

297
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,380
page of the encyclopedia and I had the

298
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,500
information there it was cool

299
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,600
from the time I was a little kid people

300
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,459
also said I was bright

301
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,440
which sort of didn't make any difference

302
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,720
to me because hey I heard it a lot B it

303
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,920
didn't mean they treated me any

304
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,200
differently it didn't seem to be good

305
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,300
for anything but it did mean that when I

306
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,339
saw something I was able to usually able

307
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,380
to figure it out and then predict the

308
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,320
next step or do something appropriately

309
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,779
but it's who cares I mean that and well

310
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,399
these days five dollars will get you a

311
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,899
cup of coffee

312
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,240
uh the other thing I discovered when I

313
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,160
was growing up that

314
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,980
authority figures around me didn't like

315
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,320
it when I was spontaneous for any length

316
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,160
of time

317
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,160
and since that got me negative feedback

318
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,339
what I basically learned to do was be

319
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,800
weird because being weird happens in a

320
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,139
real short snippet and I say something

321
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,440
that may you know stun somebody out of

322
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,740
their normality and I said it and I'm

323
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,720
done and that was the extent of my

324
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,899
spontaneity back then uh I got really

325
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,839
good at being weird and I would look for

326
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,700
opportunities saying oh here's this

327
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,380
thing what kind of you to say that will

328
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,120
freak somebody out

329
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,820
not necessarily an ideal strategy for a

330
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,279
lot of situations but it you know kept

331
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,560
me entertained

332
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,220
70 to 74. still that kind of good stuff

333
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,440
in high school I noticed there were two

334
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,360
classes of people folks who like

335
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,300
geometry and folks who liked algebra

336
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,800
and

337
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,860
they didn't it was interesting they were

338
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,899
they were sure that they preferred one

339
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,240
and the other one caused them difficulty

340
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,459
there may have been a group of people

341
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,279
who didn't get either but I behaved like

342
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,260
enough of an elitist jerk back then that

343
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,880
if you didn't like either one of them I

344
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,139
wasn't going to pay attention to you

345
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:04,260
anyway and now that I think about it

346
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,779
if there are groups of people who have

347
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,360
who are very faithful with both algebra

348
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,480
and geometry that's possible I never

349
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,820
nobody ever identified that way to me so

350
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,220
I never really thought about that one

351
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,779
um what else is exciting here

352
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,760
somewhere in the 70s I started reading

353
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,459
the books by Carlos Castaneda I really

354
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,800
like the way he wrote and his insights

355
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,160
and I would read the book read whatever

356
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,019
he had written from the first book to

357
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,360
the last book I would dog hear a page if

358
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,160
if he said anything that I thought was

359
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,100
really memorable and interesting and I

360
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,540
just keep cycling through them every

361
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,000
time he published a new book I'd add it

362
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,079
to the list

363
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,660
when he finished his seventh book The

364
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,880
Fire from within that's where I first

365
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,639
saw the elucidated concept of the

366
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,440
unknown being different from the

367
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,940
unknowable

368
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,339
and that really spoke to me because in

369
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:00,779
the past there was you know stuff you

370
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,839
knew and stuff you didn't know and I

371
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,699
didn't really care that in the pile of

372
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,260
stuff I didn't know was stuff that was

373
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,899
impossible to ever know

374
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,220
and

375
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,220
that refined a model I had

376
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,600
so

377
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,459
uh

378
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,100
the other the next aspect there is about

379
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,139
this time I decided that if I was going

380
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,000
to be happy I needed to do something

381
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,260
perfectly

382
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,880
and that I was going to strive for

383
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,100
perfection in everything I did

384
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,600
and

385
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,760
that was an interesting goal and it you

386
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,100
know ground me down for a while

387
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,320
I also that was also the time I came up

388
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,300
with my favorite between the lines Bible

389
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,440
quote

390
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,360
blessed are those who get what they

391
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,820
deserve which I think is a lovely thing

392
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,639
to say because it's kind of

393
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,019
non-judgmental and it cuts both ways

394
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,779
which is really kind of pleasant for me

395
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,220
so

396
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:53,519
[Music]

397
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,959
um

398
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,440
somewhere in the late 70s I ended up

399
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,440
reading the history of wrathless Prince

400
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,620
of abyssinia by Samuel Johnson and I

401
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,980
love the way Dr Jack uh Dr Johnson

402
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,820
writes too he

403
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,860
it's a different style because he wrote

404
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,079
it in the late 1700s and he uses a lot

405
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,899
of double negatives uh there are times

406
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,820
I'll have to reread what he says several

407
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,740
times just to let it sink in because

408
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,839
they'll say a short sentence something

409
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,839
like I'm sure I to have a quota in here

410
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,660
I wanted to tell you

411
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,040
one of the sentences he read that I

412
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,040
really liked was subsequence does not

413
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,440
imply consequence

414
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
and it's that's short I mean it's five

415
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,220
words

416
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,320
but I hear it and I think about it and I

417
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,779
go what exactly is he saying and I have

418
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,300
to think about it and I go yeah you're

419
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,680
right just because something happened

420
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,600
after something else doesn't mean that

421
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,740
there was any sort of causal

422
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,079
relationship there and I didn't mind

423
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,820
that he sometimes repeated himself in

424
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,920
his other works in a different context

425
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,660
he was he was talking about something

426
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,720
another physician said and he wrote it

427
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,939
is incident to Physicians I am afraid

428
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,579
beyond all other men to mistake

429
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,799
subsequence for consequence but it's

430
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,919
true in every in in other fields as well

431
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,500
getting back to computer stuff I started

432
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,780
programming in high school I got my

433
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,419
first programming job the summer of my

434
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,400
first year in college and managed to

435
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,500
spend the bulk of my entire junior year

436
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,020
working on an open source project for

437
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,660
online medical records it was the

438
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,419
computer stored ambulatory record which

439
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,640
was something done by Harvard Community

440
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,340
Health Plan and Mass General and

441
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,539
somebody else

442
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,179
and since I was already comfortable

443
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,220
being a programmer by that time and I

444
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,080
was doing a lot of work either in

445
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,260
medical records or you know Laboratories

446
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,480
or things like that or business I

447
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,980
figured the easiest way for me to

448
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,240
communicate

449
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
with my client base without going to

450
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,400
medical school was to get a degree in

451
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,620
business so

452
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,100
at College they tell me I can be an

453
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,880
accounting major or an economics major

454
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,220
and the accounting major means I'm going

455
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,020
to be doing all coursework

456
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,419
and if I get a degree in economics I

457
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,340
have to write a big paper

458
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,400
being no fool I went I don't want to

459
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,620
write the paper I'll take the coursework

460
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,860
so that was great the other thing I

461
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,200
realized is that the primary difference

462
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,120
between the accounting folks and the

463
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,400
economics folks is the economics folks

464
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,620
don't put numbers on the graphs on the

465
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,600
actions of their graphs and to me that

466
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,020
always felt a little

467
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,360
Luth and I I like better Precision in in

468
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,580
what I was doing on so I went for the

469
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,600
accounting

470
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,080
as I'm about to go to to graduate a

471
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,640
couple of professors asked me if I want

472
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,919
to go into graduate school and I went

473
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,559
sure one suggest that I apply to CU

474
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,419
Boulder the other one suggests that I

475
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,400
apply to Washington University in St

476
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,179
Louis

477
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,220
since my undergraduate work was in

478
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,620
Colorado Springs Colorado and I grew up

479
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,840
in Chicago I really like the Colorado

480
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,580
climate and the things I could do there

481
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,220
and the fun I had so I was really

482
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,760
looking forward to this Choice except

483
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,260
I applied to CU Boulder and uh

484
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,720
no hang on before I do that one

485
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,360
I was never moved by the proverb an

486
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,039
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of

487
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,620
cure because I don't really understand

488
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,740
what worth is it's a little too General

489
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,620
if you get russet potatoes those are one

490
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,720
to four potatoes per pound and you can

491
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,760
get a 50 pound bag of potatoes for 40

492
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,660
bucks

493
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,539
but so that's 80 cents a pound but if

494
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:43,679
you go out and you buy a pound of

495
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
potatoes that's a buck 15. so the better

496
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,780
value is in the 50 pound sack of

497
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,880
potatoes but then you got a 50 pound

498
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,919
sack of potatoes and you got to store

499
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,120
them and you gotta eat them and you got

500
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,640
to manage them so this concept of

501
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,820
where is the worth in all this gets a

502
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,860
little fuzzy for me there's just too

503
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,980
many variables in assessing worth

504
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,240
so

505
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,280
that's when I decided that an ounce of

506
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,260
prevention is cheaper than a pound of

507
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,660
cure because that focuses it in on

508
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,700
something that you know makes a

509
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,620
difference and in hindsight cheaper is

510
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,780
the wrong word an answer prevention is

511
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,799
less expensive than a pound of cure

512
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,860
so moving on to 79 to 80 which would be

513
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,440
my grad school years I took my first

514
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,500
computer science class in grad school

515
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,559
CU Boulder wrote back to me and said

516
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,380
we'd love to have you you need more math

517
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,140
and watch you in St Louis sent me back

518
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,960
saying we'd love to have you being no

519
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,539
fool I went I'm going to give up all the

520
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:46,860
wonderful things in Boulder and I'm

521
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,940
going to go to the place where they

522
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,039
didn't tell me I needed more math

523
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,380
so I show up the first day they shake my

524
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,240
hand and say we're glad to see you by

525
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,179
the way you need more math

526
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,160
oh well what can you do

527
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,500
grabs the grad school wants to know if I

528
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,820
want to do the course option or the

529
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,760
thesis option and they say I need to do

530
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,559
the thesis option if I want to go for a

531
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,039
PhD being no fool I say I'll do the

532
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,260
course option and one of the reasons for

533
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,580
that is that the the school had a bunch

534
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,860
of PhD candidates in there and they've

535
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,320
been working on their phds for somewhere

536
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,799
between 5 and 15 to 18 years I did not

537
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,539
want to be the guy who stayed in grad

538
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,520
school for a long time so I went for the

539
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,140
course option

540
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,600
somewhere in this period of time I

541
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,840
probably met Dan gear as a result of my

542
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,539
association with the co-star project and

543
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,400
I mentioned that just to drop the name

544
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
and to show the interconnections of

545
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,159
stuff between time

546
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,120
so 1980 to 81 is where I started

547
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,900
uh I did it my first

548
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,340
last significant employee gig and that

549
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,380
was for a big Hospital in St Louis I was

550
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,059
in charge of their clinical lab

551
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,240
department and I started submitting

552
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,980
language

553
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,200
software language proposals and

554
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,659
standards

555
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:15,419
proposals to folks around that

556
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,100
one of the things I did while I was

557
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,380
working at the hospital is I wanted we

558
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,480
were very concerned about database

559
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,320
caching and things like that and I there

560
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,179
was much discussion about the algorithms

561
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,760
you'd use to retire buffers from the

562
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,980
cache and how much cash do you need and

563
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,900
things like that and I said I've got a

564
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,000
great idea I've got this giant lab

565
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,460
computer here with you know gazillions

566
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,620
of stations out there I'm going to time

567
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,600
stamp the request and location and size

568
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,220
of every record that comes through there

569
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,500
and I'm going to measure it so once I go

570
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,179
through this measuring phase I can go

571
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,280
back and replay this against a bunch of

572
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,740
different algorithms to see how it goes

573
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,200
a whole bunch of people hated me for 24

574
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,700
hours because

575
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,039
I kind of messed up in how I did it and

576
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,539
I didn't

577
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,760
and things were slow for a whole 24

578
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,500
hours and they they were not happy with

579
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,260
me but I got really great data out of it

580
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,320
and I learned well just to summarize it

581
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,539
it does not matter which cash retirement

582
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,520
algorithm you use

583
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,980
what matters is you have enough cash and

584
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,080
this is probably no news to anybody in

585
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,340
here because you guys have been working

586
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,380
with caching and buffers for a really

587
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,460
long time but it was good then and I

588
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,799
didn't know about the ACM transactions

589
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,559
on database systems Journal back then if

590
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,659
I did I would have published this and I

591
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,580
think my life would have taken a

592
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,460
different turn which is cool

593
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,600
um

594
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,780
I moved on from the hospital around 82.

595
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,820
most everything you'll see is still the

596
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,299
same at that point I took over

597
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,460
a client server database system that was

598
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,200
mostly used in medical Computing and the

599
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,960
rest of it and

600
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,960
so I put a lot of effort into making

601
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,780
that code portable and efficient because

602
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,000
at the time everybody was who was doing

603
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,980
that language implementation was making

604
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,260
it work on a specific field a specific

605
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,080
brand of computers and I had a Unix box

606
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,520
it was an onyx c8000 it was it may have

607
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,260
had two Megs of memory and I think we

608
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,760
could have bumped it to four without a

609
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,440
whole lot of trouble but you know I was

610
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,620
a 19 inch thing about 5u it was

611
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,840
impressive but it could do a lot the

612
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,700
language used to be you used to write

613
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,500
software in this language in a 4K

614
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,919
partition 2K of program and 2K of data

615
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,100
and with this Unix thing I had megabytes

616
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,900
there were all sorts of fun things I

617
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,600
could do so we put a lot of work on

618
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,720
there and

619
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,559
um

620
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,780
I'm trying not to say um and sometimes

621
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,539
I'm not succeeding

622
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,299
I ended up porting that code to well

623
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:54,960
over 500 versions of Unix and other

624
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,780
operating systems on 80 or 90 different

625
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,299
vendors platforms and it got to the

626
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,880
point where

627
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,620
if I had a customer who needed something

628
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,720
and I was going to get on a plane I

629
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,480
remember getting out of the airport in

630
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,020
San Jose driving to Sun Microsystems

631
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,720
slapping my meeting an engineer slapped

632
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,900
a tape on the machine loaded it in typed

633
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,020
make waited 15 minutes put the tape on

634
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,940
to build for the customer and I was out

635
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,919
of there in under an hour with a fully

636
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,260
ported cuff reasonably well customized

637
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,120
version for the operating system but I

638
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,799
could send off to the customer

639
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,480
it was great

640
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,820
also during this time

641
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,440
I was introduced to my next favorite

642
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,900
author I was at a party at my friend

643
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,480
Laura's house and she had this huge and

644
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,700
amazing collection of books that were

645
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,159
spread out all around the room and I was

646
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,140
being an introvert sitting in a chair

647
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,600
and she was off somewhere else talking

648
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,179
to other friends as I'm scanning all the

649
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,059
titles in the bookshelf I call out the

650
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,640
snark out boys and the avocado of death

651
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,360
and she heard me and said read it I

652
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,400
think you're gonna like it so I borrowed

653
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,500
it read it liked it very much and I now

654
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,260
have around 90 of pink water's titles

655
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,299
he writes everything from little kids

656
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:15,360
books up to adult and

657
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,840
audio books and I think he's awesome and

658
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,400
all the people we give them to who have

659
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,500
kids say this is my kid's favorite book

660
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,360
I read it to him and they said and my

661
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,100
kids said can this be an every night

662
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,520
book that was one of my best feedbacks I

663
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,960
got about that

664
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,299
another thing I wanted to mention here

665
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,700
was back in the late 70s my best friend

666
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,860
in college and I realized that we

667
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,020
weren't really happy with how our lives

668
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,419
were going we were doing all the right

669
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:43,980
things going through the motions but it

670
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,260
wasn't particularly satisfying and we

671
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,059
would sign up for seminars and go to

672
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,799
trainings and read books

673
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,260
and we'd get a slice of something that

674
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,640
seemed like it would make good if only

675
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,340
all the ancillary stuff you know wasn't

676
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,620
an issue but it was

677
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,020
he calls me one day and says I finally

678
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,380
found a seminar that delivers on its

679
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,440
promise of how what's a good way to live

680
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,500
your life I liked it so much I signed

681
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,840
you up for the next course I got you a

682
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,600
plane ticket and I got you a hotel room

683
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,039
and I went

684
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,279
Okay so

685
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,700
I was looking forward to the experience

686
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,700
so uh where are we here

687
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,799
a couple weeks later I flew from St

688
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,140
Louis to Oregon for the seminar and I

689
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,419
trusted him but I didn't trust the

690
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:34,980
seminar folks and they shouldn't take it

691
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,900
personally I didn't really trust anybody

692
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,779
I have a 30-figure issues

693
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:40,980
so

694
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,080
I arrived and I sat in the back row of

695
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,059
the training with my arms and legs

696
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:48,539
crossed because you know weird stuff as

697
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,580
I recall they started at nine o'clock in

698
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,480
the morning

699
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,299
and they said here's what we're going to

700
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,400
do we're going to tell you what we're

701
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,539
going to cover

702
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,059
from after the lunch break today until

703
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,559
Sunday night

704
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,320
and if you decide you're not interested

705
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,260
go to the front desk at the break we'll

706
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,600
give you your money back and you know

707
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,120
thank you for showing up so far

708
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,039
if you come back and you go through the

709
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,799
seminar and you leave on Sunday and

710
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,900
decide you didn't get Great Value we'll

711
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,700
give you your money back

712
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,000
but if you leave before between

713
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,159
Thursday lunchtime and Sunday you're not

714
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,500
getting your money back we very strongly

715
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,480
believe in what we're going to tell you

716
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,240
and we and we figure your time and money

717
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,279
are valuable to us so if you stick it

718
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,779
through we'll give you your money back

719
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,640
if you bail in the middle we're not

720
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,080
going to give you your money back we're

721
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,240
going to cover a lot of material and

722
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,919
it's going to be uncomfortable and we

723
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,380
want to make sure you've got at least a

724
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,360
useful anchor to keep you there

725
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,779
so it made perfect sense to me and the

726
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,700
best part about it was is I'm in this

727
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,640
room with with uh 88 other parties 87

728
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,740
other participants and I don't know

729
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,559
anybody I mean I could say something

730
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,140
about my life and they could hate me and

731
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,779
decide I'm a really scummy person but

732
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,820
I'm never going to see them again so I

733
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,039
don't care so it was really easy for me

734
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,559
to go ahead and sit through this thing

735
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,919
so that was lovely and

736
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,140
I didn't know it at the time but that

737
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,779
again was an example of

738
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,539
My Life as a locally optimal solution

739
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,640
and the thing about locally optimal

740
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,620
solution is it's a high a relative local

741
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,020
high point and to get anywhere away from

742
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,600
there you got to go through garbage and

743
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,100
you know I'm trying to keep my nose

744
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,779
above this stuff I don't want to go

745
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,179
wallow through it again but if there's

746
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,700
no place easily identifiable better I'm

747
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,580
stuck with a locally optimal solution

748
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,020
so

749
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,720
on Thursday afternoon they talk about

750
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,419
ownership and accountability

751
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,140
and we spent a lot of time on the victim

752
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,000
persecutor rescuer stuff which I later

753
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,159
learned as the Cartman drama triangle

754
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,659
and one of the things that became

755
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,700
obvious that at least

756
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,820
here in in the Western World we drive a

757
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,340
whole lot of stuff from that model and

758
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,559
it's kind of pervasive and the trick is

759
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,659
that's about getting validation from the

760
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,039
outside

761
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,779
and

762
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,240
they talk about how each of those roles

763
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,760
victim persecutor rescuer needs the

764
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,159
other two roles in order to function you

765
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,380
can't be one you can't successfully be

766
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,899
one without the others to continue and

767
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,520
propagate the loop

768
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,020
so

769
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,480
they covered that and they also said why

770
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,520
there were different models and what and

771
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,679
how things would be better

772
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,899
and it made sense to me so I decided I'd

773
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,100
learn about it

774
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,879
uh

775
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,640
outside validation I apologize for this

776
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,380
I wasn't expecting to have to read like

777
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,220
this

778
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,659
the the net takeaway from that is they

779
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:57,120
recommended that we switch to I am the

780
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,820
source of my experience because I get to

781
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,620
decide how I'm going to respond to

782
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,380
events that happen to me

783
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,899
at the first break

784
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,240
I moved from the back row to the front

785
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,679
row and stayed there through most of the

786
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,419
most of the seminar

787
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,240
they also talk a lot about language and

788
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,779
how saying uh you made me mad when you

789
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,059
did this that's disempowering because

790
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,640
you didn't make me do anything you you

791
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,039
did something I chose to be angry about

792
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,080
it and I'm blaming you for it that's

793
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,940
useless that doesn't let me change

794
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,059
anything so I really like that

795
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,039
Thursday night ended with a group

796
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,159
exercise with 88 people in it where

797
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,440
everybody was heard so we got out after

798
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,140
two in the morning it was an awesome day

799
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,000
and I really loved it

800
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,740
Friday was a deep dive around

801
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,080
vulnerability which when I heard the

802
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,940
word vulnerability I bridled because

803
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,940
vulnerability means weakness and they

804
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,120
said no vulnerability means openness

805
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,480
and I said okay I can I can go with that

806
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,059
definition and

807
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,340
I realized that I had built up a lot of

808
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,980
behaviors around myself to block things

809
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,380
out that I didn't want and that in doing

810
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,480
so I was denying myself sources of

811
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,799
feedback and information that would

812
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,960
actually be useful and having spent the

813
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,580
previous day dealing with openness and

814
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,799
accountability that suddenly started to

815
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,120
make sense with this and it was all

816
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,340
starting to

817
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,720
refocus my energies and efforts to

818
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,760
getting into some place useful

819
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,899
so that was a really long day too

820
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,059
realizing I could be open and I don't

821
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,860
have to defend myself because well I'm

822
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,080
not about to let you offend me or hurt

823
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,640
you know your reaction isn't going to do

824
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,140
anything about me it says more about you

825
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,700
than it does about me

826
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,380
and in a few minutes I'm actually going

827
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,760
to tell you how all this ties together

828
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,020
and helps with ntp

829
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,840
because it actually does

830
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,020
Saturday was spent on integrity and the

831
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,120
the premise that the person we break our

832
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,159
word to the most is ourself I'm going to

833
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,140
go to the gym today I'm only going to

834
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,059
eat one cookie

835
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,500
so

836
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,899
they covered a whole lot of territory

837
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,659
really deeply it helped me rebuild all

838
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,360
my models around behaviors and

839
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,100
I thought it was awesome

840
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,860
Sunday was about spontaneity something

841
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,500
that always gave me trouble and the

842
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,640
reason

843
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,679
they shifted it the very first something

844
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,899
when they said spontaneity is where Joy

845
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,340
Of Life comes from

846
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,019
if something happens and you can deal

847
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,059
with it spontaneously for me that's

848
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,600
that's a really empowering happy thing

849
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,240
and I loved it uh

850
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,340
when the seminar ended I went right to

851
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,720
the front desk and signed up for their

852
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,340
second course

853
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,220
I my friend who sent me there picked me

854
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,019
up drove me back to his place his wife

855
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:47,279
who had also been through the trainings

856
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,799
talked and I talked for hours that night

857
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,380
it was great the drive home from the

858
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,960
seminar was amazing because I was a

859
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,200
passenger and being hyper Vigilant and

860
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,720
stuck in my patterns when I'm driving

861
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,779
I'm looking ahead there's a set schedule

862
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,700
in which I check left check right check

863
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,679
behind me see what's going on

864
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,139
and as a result of the seminar whenever

865
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,699
I would look at something I would start

866
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,560
perceiving all sorts of stuff I never

867
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,080
noticed before and that meant that had I

868
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,879
been behind the wheel of a car I would

869
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,379
have driven into something in about 10

870
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:20,460
seconds

871
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,500
is a completely messed up my sense of

872
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,580
timing the good news was after a day

873
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,918
I felt I was able to get enough of a

874
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,540
handle on it that I was I was safe to

875
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,918
drive again

876
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,359
so

877
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,980
I've never been interested in

878
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,780
recreational chemistry

879
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,099
I

880
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,879
uh

881
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,520
no no drugs of any kind I would have at

882
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,159
most one beer maybe a quarter ounce of

883
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,199
alcohol because as soon as I got that

884
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,820
far I'd noticed my depth reception

885
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,480
changing and being hyper Vigilant and

886
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,280
eating huge amounts of food because of

887
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,680
all the energy that takes if I start

888
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,540
altering my perceptions of reality

889
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,580
that's exhausting because it's

890
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,560
incredibly overwhelming I have a hard

891
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,300
enough time keeping event keeping track

892
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,160
of reality as that is I don't need

893
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,900
things messing up my

894
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,119
my incoming perception so I can track

895
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:12,900
things

896
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,940
so

897
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,980
it's stuff

898
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,440
I get back to St Louis went into the

899
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,079
office and my staff noticed how much

900
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,660
lighter and happier I was I walked

901
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,859
through the door and said the business

902
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:27,960
will pay for anybody who wants to do

903
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,400
this thing I think there were about

904
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,400
eight people and staff about that time

905
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,260
and they looked and they wanted to see

906
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,339
because they could tell it was better

907
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:36,599
but they didn't know if it was going to

908
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,700
stick or anything they watched me come

909
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,119
back from the second seminar even better

910
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,980
nobody wanted to be the first to go and

911
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,920
my VP perhaps out of a sense feeling a

912
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,960
sense of Duty decided that he was going

913
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,700
to stand up and say okay I'll go and do

914
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,440
this too we'll see what it's like

915
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,560
and he came back just beaming much

916
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,900
lighter much happier told everybody how

917
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,960
awesome it was and I think

918
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,820
almost everybody went through it I had

919
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,619
you know with staff turnover I think I

920
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,300
had about 16 people go through the

921
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,040
trainings after that point

922
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,200
there was a benefit to this that I did

923
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,320
not expect and the benefit was having

924
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,940
had so many people go through the

925
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,619
trainings we all had common language

926
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:20,220
around saying what we you know saying

927
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,839
what you wanted knowing that they could

928
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,520
believe it and if somebody said

929
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,720
something you knew they were going to do

930
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,119
it and it made things significantly more

931
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,440
productive uh we loved it at that time I

932
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,900
was a major approval suck I would do if

933
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,400
you wanted to do something I would say

934
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,859
yes because I wanted your approval and I

935
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:39,599
was starting to undo that with the other

936
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,400
bits of the training I had

937
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,740
on Sunday mornings my friend Dave and I

938
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,920
used to go to a local restaurant and

939
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,619
I enjoyed it but I think the drinking

940
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:50,760
water there may not have been great

941
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,920
because every time we went there I would

942
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,440
get sick so I come back after the

943
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,820
training and Dave said hey you want to

944
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,980
go to the usual restaurant and I stopped

945
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,940
and said

946
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,000
no how about we go somewhere else and he

947
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,760
went sure and by the way I've known you

948
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,140
for several years and this is the first

949
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,300
time you've ever told me no

950
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,640
progress

951
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,500
so somewhere in here I also start

952
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,599
studying energy work and Kinesiology

953
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,160
muscle testing

954
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,140
to me it's also intuitive in the rest of

955
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,800
it

956
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,619
oh in the second seminar I realized

957
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,079
Perfection achieving Perfection is not

958
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,900
possible at least not for me and I had

959
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,180
the realization or possibly an epiphany

960
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,240
that I could be perfectly satisfied

961
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,400
achieving Excellence Excellence is an

962
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,260
attainable goal for me and I can

963
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,359
continue to make improvements and

964
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,820
refinements on that so that was a major

965
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,740
shift in my life that helped me to be a

966
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,520
much happier person

967
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,660
returning to computers I did a lot of

968
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,339
work on the client server database thing

969
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,200
that I mentioned I also did a lot of

970
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,900
Consulting projects and I used Pearl for

971
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,880
a whole bunch of things back then and

972
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,740
since I had my database server running

973
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,440
on over 500 different plot versions of

974
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,660
hardware and software I really wanted to

975
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,280
make the porting process a whole lot

976
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,240
easier

977
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,660
so I started using the metaconfig stuff

978
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,460
for Pearl which is where you type you

979
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,040
know configure with a Capital C and it

980
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,619
just does most of the right stuff

981
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,140
but while configure was great and I was

982
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,140
submitting a lot of patches to it uh and

983
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,960
I did that to the point where Larry said

984
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,220
Larry well said you're doing this so

985
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,240
much how about if you take over

986
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,040
maintenance of the meta config package I

987
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,260
went okay that made it that much easier

988
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,480
for me to get patches into it

989
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,240
um it worked until I said hey Larry I

990
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,740
need the next release of pearl he says

991
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,880
well as soon as you tell me you've

992
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,339
nailed on metaconfig 2.0 I'll release it

993
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,020
it's like okay two weeks later the next

994
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,579
release of pearl was out it was lovely

995
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:48,980
and wonderful

996
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,020
autocots gnu Auto conference not yet was

997
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,500
barely a thing just then and while I

998
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,880
like the fact that it could build in

999
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,180
subdirectories uh and it was completely

1000
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,920
automated you didn't need any user

1001
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,060
interaction

1002
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,640
he didn't have David McKenzie didn't

1003
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,320
have a lot of fine grain tests in there

1004
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,839
and I would submit patches and he would

1005
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,640
reject them saying Oh you're testing for

1006
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,440
silly stupid things that nobody needs

1007
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,200
well I'm not nobody but I guess nobody

1008
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,200
besides me needs it that's cool

1009
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,940
um

1010
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,400
I got to maintain my local patches for a

1011
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,460
while on that and eventually that David

1012
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,160
eventually realized that you know I may

1013
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,200
be bleeding edge but I'm not strangely

1014
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,460
nuts

1015
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,060
so

1016
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,200
I leveraged all this stuff into

1017
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,180
Consulting gigs and the rest of it where

1018
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,520
I do porting and configuration for folks

1019
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,920
and one of the first places I did this

1020
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,320
was for a radiation treatment company in

1021
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,020
St Louis that that did all their

1022
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,619
development work over NFS with uh deck

1023
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,839
digital Equipment Corporation for those

1024
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,240
of you who are younger Hewlett Packard

1025
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,000
and silicon graphics for those of you

1026
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,540
who are younger and so we had several

1027
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,820
different machines all using NFS and if

1028
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,740
you're doing distributed builds you got

1029
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,780
to have accurate time or make isn't

1030
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,400
going to know what's newer and what's

1031
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,740
older so there were basically two

1032
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,240
versions of time synchronization

1033
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,180
available back then ntp and burnished

1034
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,400
drivers timedy program I looked at them

1035
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,579
both and I recall I hope I remember

1036
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,280
correctly it was 30 years ago the time D

1037
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,380
wanted to be told

1038
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,980
uh who to listen to for time and ntp

1039
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,060
says

1040
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,820
give me a list of servers I think I am

1041
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,859
saying I'm going to evaluate the other

1042
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,960
options I have and I'm going to choose

1043
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,000
the ones that I think are correct and I

1044
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,619
like that a lot because to me that's

1045
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,260
accountable behavior I'm going to assume

1046
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,200
responsibility for my actions

1047
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,040
so ntp uses the Byzantine generals prop

1048
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,800
solution for deciding whether or not to

1049
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,339
to trust somebody if you expect n

1050
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:05,400
sources to be insane you better have 2N

1051
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,980
plus one in your pool because that way

1052
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,740
you're always going to have the insane

1053
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,320
folks will always be a minority

1054
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,940
and

1055
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,240
I like that it's it you know as I

1056
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,520
mentioned it's accountable so I pick ntp

1057
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,619
as the tool for time sync we build

1058
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,460
everything and the problem with ntp at

1059
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,280
that time was that it was a tarball you

1060
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,040
unpacked it you manually edited the make

1061
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,099
file you manually edited a config.h file

1062
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,619
you built it and you were done

1063
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,720
and you built in the source directory so

1064
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,400
if you start to have multiple versions

1065
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,320
of os's that may not have forward

1066
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,660
compatibility on their libraries and if

1067
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,460
you have multiple machines

1068
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,260
you have to have multiple directories

1069
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,180
and if you make any change to one of

1070
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,619
them you've got bitrot because you may

1071
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,180
not be propagating those changes to

1072
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,700
everything else it was miserable

1073
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,300
I really wanted ntp to use

1074
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,640
gnu Auto conf so I could have a single

1075
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,619
Source copy I could build in

1076
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:07,020
subdirectories on each machine I'd have

1077
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,880
a single always updated instead of the

1078
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,220
source code and it would work

1079
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,879
so

1080
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,560
until we could get to goodoo auto conf

1081
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,440
and make since I was running ntp on all

1082
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,119
these platforms I started to send Dave

1083
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,980
Mills lots and lots of patches for

1084
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,200
things which he appreciated

1085
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,079
and at some point

1086
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,420
he decided I was helpful enough that I

1087
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,800
should help I should be part of the

1088
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,780
project and depending on what you want

1089
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,460
to call it I either became his baby's

1090
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,280
babysitter or the janitor of time or

1091
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,619
perhaps the nanny of time one of those

1092
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:42,540
things it's not really that important to

1093
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,380
me

1094
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,099
in 96 June I asked Dave if he wanted me

1095
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,900
to convert the ntp code base to Auto

1096
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,000
conf and he said sure

1097
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,839
so I think I did that and

1098
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:57,060
about two months later I had it all

1099
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,140
finished

1100
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,300
and that's when I stepped in it I gave

1101
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,520
the copy to I gave the code to Dave I

1102
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,319
told him how to use it and said let me

1103
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,780
know a day or so later he came back and

1104
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,180
said that's really great I like this

1105
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,819
either way I didn't want to step on your

1106
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:13,980
toes while I was doing this so I've got

1107
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,900
this queue of patches over here would

1108
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,619
you please apply them I went sure

1109
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:22,560
so that was great and I take that job

1110
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,599
over too and then it comes time to do

1111
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,839
the next release and we were big fans of

1112
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,819
what vixi used to call eating your own

1113
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,460
dog food and that meant that if we built

1114
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,440
the code we ran the code and we tested

1115
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,319
it and I said Dave you know I'm already

1116
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:39,540
it's all built but I don't have root

1117
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,280
access you need to install all this so

1118
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,380
we can test it he says no problem here's

1119
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,060
the root password I didn't think

1120
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,800
anything about that

1121
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,319
a few years go by and we're now working

1122
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:52,260
on ntp version four and at one point I'm

1123
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,420
emailing with Dave's grad student about

1124
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,160
something we got to do and the grad

1125
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,900
student says oh we we can't do that

1126
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,020
until later because we need root access

1127
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,060
for that and nobody has it I said well I

1128
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,839
have root access and he paused and he

1129
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,380
said whoa the only people who have root

1130
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,260
on days machines are Dave and two of the

1131
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,000
people at the top of the food chain in

1132
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,480
campus I.T nobody gets root on Dave's

1133
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,940
machine I went okay

1134
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,099
so

1135
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,099
uh where am I going Dave and I used to

1136
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,260
get into rare but intense fights on the

1137
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,140
mailing list over technical issues

1138
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,599
I would get into rare but intense fights

1139
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,880
with Danny Mayer a technical developer

1140
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,099
on ntp on the mailing list and Dave

1141
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,200
would occasionally get into rare but

1142
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,060
intense fights with a variety of other

1143
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,540
people including Judah at nist and the

1144
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,640
folks at U.S Naval Observatory and Folks

1145
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,619
at ptb in Germany and a couple of other

1146
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:50,640
folks

1147
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,560
and we never thought anything about

1148
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,660
these fights because you know it's just

1149
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,700
what we did it was Behavior we were all

1150
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,920
comfortable with I subsequently learned

1151
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,240
that several people were quite

1152
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,420
disconcerted about these these technical

1153
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,099
dust stops

1154
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,140
after one of my fights with Dave I was

1155
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,760
chatting with his grad student and I

1156
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,220
said you know Dave is fighting me really

1157
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,839
hard on this I wonder if he doesn't like

1158
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:13,619
me

1159
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,500
and

1160
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,720
his immediate reply was Dave fights

1161
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,000
harder with you than with anybody I have

1162
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,800
ever seen before and that includes what

1163
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,380
he does here on campus

1164
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,500
he only fights with people he respects

1165
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,300
and if he didn't respect you he would

1166
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,500
ignore you

1167
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,480
oh okay

1168
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,300
so a little while later I'm doing an

1169
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,400
email discussion with with maybe it was

1170
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,800
a phone call with Miroslav litchvar who

1171
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,380
went on to write crony and David just

1172
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,540
gotten into a email fight with Miroslav

1173
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,760
and Miroslav says you know I wonder if

1174
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,859
Dave doesn't like me because he fights

1175
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:52,380
me so hard and I said I just learned

1176
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,240
something Dave doesn't fight with people

1177
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,240
he doesn't respect and Miroslav went oh

1178
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,799
so that was cool

1179
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,319
one of the people I met in the Eugene

1180
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,900
seminar was a guy named Ron Kurtz and he

1181
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,060
was there with his future wife Terry and

1182
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,740
the people at the seminar told us they

1183
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,560
invited Ron because

1184
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,480
Ron was the founder of something called

1185
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,240
hakomi Psychotherapy and it's a school

1186
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,339
of psychotherapy that's founded on five

1187
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:23,660
principles organicity mindfulness

1188
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:27,540
non-violence mind-body holism and unity

1189
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,599
none of that made any sense to me and I

1190
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,480
had no real idea what Psychotherapy was

1191
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,880
but Ron and I got along well and we kept

1192
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,260
in touch over the years

1193
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,540
after one of our chats Ron said he

1194
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,040
thought I might really like to take one

1195
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,680
of his trainings I believed him and even

1196
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,000
though I had no idea what they were

1197
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,140
about

1198
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,060
I was working a lot of hours and could

1199
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,040
use a vacation so I went sure let me see

1200
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,280
what I can do and he says well we meet

1201
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,220
for one month a year for two years and I

1202
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,780
can't do that with my Consulting

1203
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,280
schedule somebody's gonna call me up I

1204
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,420
gotta fly somewhere I'm going to miss

1205
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,760
these trainings he went okay

1206
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,859
and in a few minutes I will tell you how

1207
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:08,040
all this applies to ntp

1208
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,079
he calls me up and says I'm doing a new

1209
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,280
training we're going to meet for one

1210
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,680
month a year for three years I can

1211
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,960
schedule a month off so I sign up for

1212
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,220
this thing

1213
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,319
I fly to Medford Oregon for the training

1214
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:20,460
where I meet the other in 19

1215
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,740
participants and probably 10 staffers

1216
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,740
for the very first time half of the half

1217
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,900
of the participants turn out to be PhD

1218
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,240
psychotherapists the other half are

1219
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,520
massage therapists I still don't really

1220
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,800
know what Psychotherapy is and during

1221
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,960
the introduction that the first of the

1222
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,760
thing the psychotherapists all say

1223
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,060
they're there because they

1224
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,140
hakomi came into their sphere of

1225
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,119
awareness and they wanted to learn it

1226
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,220
and put it into their toolbox

1227
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,680
all the massage therapists said they

1228
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,420
were aware of it and they noticed that

1229
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,400
when they're working on people in

1230
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,099
session they may have emotional releases

1231
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:57,660
and they want to have the

1232
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,940
resourcefulness to be of of assistance

1233
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,619
to somebody who's having a severe

1234
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,599
emotional release or something like that

1235
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,819
and they get to me and I say I'm here

1236
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,440
because I know Ronnie thinks I'll like

1237
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,079
it and that's about the extent of it at

1238
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,760
the end of the first day I learned that

1239
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,400
Psychotherapy is talk therapy how's that

1240
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,140
for a revelation for somebody who's been

1241
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,760
on the planet for you know 30 some odd

1242
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,440
years and

1243
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,480
I on the end of the second day I

1244
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,040
realized I signed up for a training on

1245
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,960
how to learn to be a psychotherapist

1246
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,020
I am not a psychotherapist I have been

1247
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,200
trained in it but I am not

1248
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,240
so hakomi integrates a number of

1249
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,400
different practices including Chaos

1250
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,700
Theory fractal Theory Buddhism and

1251
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,619
general systems theory

1252
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:42,839
and all this stuff ties in really well

1253
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:44,339
with all the computer stuff I'm doing

1254
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,800
you've got Chaos Theory with Jitter and

1255
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,900
noise and all the rest of it you've got

1256
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,780
fractal Theory because if you look at a

1257
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,520
problem and dive down into it you end up

1258
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,560
seeing more and more complexity that has

1259
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,119
to be teased about and all the rest of

1260
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,760
it and general systems theory is all

1261
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,720
about

1262
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,060
identifying

1263
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,880
feedback loops and cause and effect

1264
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,740
possibly with delays and all the rest of

1265
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,380
it so it fits in really well with my

1266
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,359
desire to

1267
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:15,240
come up with ways to model stuff

1268
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,220
so

1269
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,960
in this training

1270
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,300
uh

1271
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,800
so one of the things that happens in

1272
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,740
hakomi is the therapist will go to the

1273
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,599
client and and identify something that

1274
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,920
they know that they don't believe the

1275
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,260
client is aware of and they will get the

1276
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,000
client into a state of mindfulness and

1277
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,640
awareness and then bring up that thing

1278
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,040
to see what's noticed

1279
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,440
and it's incredibly enlightening and

1280
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,819
it's really useful

1281
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:45,300
and that's the short summary of hakomi

1282
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,900
is evoked experience and mindfulness

1283
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,380
one of the other places we got there was

1284
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,500
Richard Schwartz a PhD

1285
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,319
psychotherapist in Chicago independently

1286
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,780
came up with the awareness of fractals

1287
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,180
and general System Theory and turned all

1288
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,440
that into how do we apply this into

1289
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,000
Psychotherapy and he came out and did

1290
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,859
some guest talks every once in a while

1291
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:13,440
the thing I like about fractals is I can

1292
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,140
look at me as a

1293
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,900
as an entity I've got organs that do

1294
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,000
their own Parts if you go down to the

1295
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,859
cellular level they do things you've got

1296
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:24,960
DNA you've got molecules you've got

1297
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,040
atoms it zooms down zooming up there's

1298
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,680
how I interrelate with my partner with

1299
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,220
my family extended family neighborhood

1300
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,500
counties it goes up and fractals for me

1301
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,180
are a really wonderful way to zoom in

1302
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,079
and out

1303
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,800
similarly to ntp and the other issues of

1304
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,660
trying to tease

1305
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,940
signal from the noise for lack of a

1306
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,040
better phrase

1307
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,920
back in the 80s ntp was able to keep

1308
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,780
clocks on computers synced within a

1309
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,220
tenth of a second

1310
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,319
and over the intervening years we've

1311
00:50:58,319 --> 00:50:59,640
gotten to the point where on a decent

1312
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,800
machine with a normal land we can

1313
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,380
synchronize clocks to a millisecond so

1314
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,359
we've gotten

1315
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:09,420
yeah we've gotten an order to magnitude

1316
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,180
better just by paying attention and

1317
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,740
teasing things out and figure out what

1318
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,619
to do with them better and better

1319
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:18,000
they've paid a lot of attention to make

1320
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,859
sure those things happen and he did it

1321
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:21,599
in a way that when you combine it with a

1322
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,480
variety of external events the wheels

1323
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,460
don't fly off the bus

1324
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,160
so but the news around that isn't all

1325
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,240
great

1326
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,240
back in the day used to nist used to

1327
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,520
synchronize their remote systems using

1328
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,359
Bell 212a modems and phone lines

1329
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,359
and it was awesome because a bell 212a

1330
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:45,000
modem is discrete components and it

1331
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,579
exhibits constant delay time regardless

1332
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:50,520
of what sort of data is in there

1333
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,160
the phone wire are real copper wires

1334
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,359
even if they're going through switches

1335
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:55,559
and things like that so you've got

1336
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:58,200
constant delay that way too

1337
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,559
and as we've gone to software modems and

1338
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:04,500
digitizing voice it now means that the

1339
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,260
phone system is no good for for accurate

1340
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,780
time synchronization anymore

1341
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,700
there are other sources of noise that

1342
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,319
enter the mix

1343
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:16,559
ntp sinks time to my mind in the heart

1344
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,300
of the system and in order to

1345
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,220
communicate the time there you've got to

1346
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,740
go through the operating system kernel

1347
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,140
layers user space you've got interrupts

1348
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,059
you've got all sorts of stuff and it is

1349
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:28,980
if you're going to exchange it

1350
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,660
from there with somebody else you then

1351
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,760
have to go back down into the drivers

1352
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,800
into the hardware all the rest of it and

1353
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,700
that's a that's a lot of noise that is

1354
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,819
unknown and it's Jitter it's gonna it's

1355
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:44,400
gonna place a limit on how how well you

1356
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,380
can transmit time and then you get to

1357
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,359
the network interface which is going to

1358
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:49,800
go out on the wire and you've got

1359
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,440
Network delays and all the rest of it so

1360
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,440
that's tough Larry mcvoy has a favorite

1361
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,300
a favorite quote which goes something

1362
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,119
like in school one studies various

1363
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,940
theories and you'll often hear assume a

1364
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,040
frictionless surface and then go off and

1365
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,200
study the theory the difference between

1366
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,599
school and Industry is that in school

1367
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:14,880
one pays attention to the theory while

1368
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,920
in Industry one pays attention to the

1369
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,480
friction

1370
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,059
in the fall of 95 I started what would

1371
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:23,040
become a two-year contract as a Senior

1372
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,599
Systems administrator for an insurance

1373
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:25,800
company

1374
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,200
that we want you to be here to do things

1375
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,599
in case they break I said okay so you

1376
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,339
want me to fix them they said no we

1377
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:33,900
don't want you to fix them we want you

1378
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,839
to be here in case we decide to fix them

1379
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,940
and how we're going to fix them

1380
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,700
and it was weird but I said okay

1381
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,400
and after I'd been there a couple weeks

1382
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,319
I realized this is an insurance company

1383
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,020
I'm their insurance policy

1384
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,099
okay

1385
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,440
I finish all my monitoring tools and the

1386
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,480
rest of it and

1387
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,859
say

1388
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:58,020
what do you want me to do while I have

1389
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,059
while everything's humming along nicely

1390
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:02,640
and they said do whatever you want as

1391
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,160
long as it doesn't cost me money

1392
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,440
so Dave Mills and I spent a lot of work

1393
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,420
those years and we got the last releases

1394
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,880
of ntp3 out the door and the first few

1395
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,700
Alpha releases of ntp4

1396
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,140
somewhere in there I was also

1397
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,460
contemplating the issues around

1398
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,740
communication and achieving consensus

1399
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,740
how do how do people

1400
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,200
change somebody's mind and get them to

1401
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,420
achieve consensus

1402
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,920
I knew that there were a lot of

1403
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,380
destructive ways to do that and it's

1404
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,859
called manipulation so I heard about a

1405
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:37,859
book entitled influencing with integrity

1406
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:40,200
and I went there's a title I can get

1407
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,819
behind I got to read this and see what

1408
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:44,300
it's all about

1409
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,480
so moving forward we see the last Alpha

1410
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,359
releases of ntp4 the beta releases of

1411
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,940
ntp4 and the first production release of

1412
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,200
ntp4

1413
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,079
Dave never liked source code control

1414
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,420
and uh

1415
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,640
he said and I finally got him to agree

1416
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,920
to it and he said it must be invisible

1417
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,079
to me and if I ever see it I'm going to

1418
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:08,880
yank it out by the roots

1419
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,819
so I started off with C I knew I didn't

1420
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:16,200
like RCS pick CVS looked at SVN said no

1421
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,680
way uh and went with that Larry mcvoy

1422
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,660
had come up with bitkeeper by then I've

1423
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,700
been talking to them and after two years

1424
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,220
I went ahead and switched to bitkeeper

1425
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,859
it behaves the way I think so I almost

1426
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,540
never have to go to the documentation

1427
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,359
and it just works the way I want and

1428
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,980
it's perfect for our work environment

1429
00:55:37,339 --> 00:55:39,720
those same times I was looking for ways

1430
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,119
to people to support the ntp project we

1431
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:45,300
didn't have any sort of

1432
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,099
legal entity around us so people

1433
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,079
couldn't just give us money I had to

1434
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,660
figure out a way to solve that

1435
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:52,859
um

1436
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:54,839
in one of these places in the previous

1437
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:56,400
slide I mentioned the Fifth Discipline

1438
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,559
Peter sangeet's book halfway through the

1439
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,599
book there's a section about open uh

1440
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,819
openness and complexity that talks about

1441
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:03,900
how

1442
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,300
feedback relationships and intricut or

1443
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,180
complex systems get really nasty which

1444
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,460
speaks a lot about ntp because you do

1445
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,720
something the wrong way the wheels fly

1446
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,059
off the bus

1447
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:18,720
that goes back to fractals and how to

1448
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,540
visualize and put these things together

1449
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,760
I'm not going to read this to you but

1450
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,740
it's in the slide so if anybody cares

1451
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,720
they can go back and get it

1452
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,960
the the the example I was really looking

1453
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,000
for that I couldn't find is that if you

1454
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,859
get a bunch of people together groups of

1455
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,660
people together who are trying to solve

1456
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,420
a problem there can be a real issue of a

1457
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,099
people don't communicate openly and

1458
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:43,740
honestly and B if there are significant

1459
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,780
stakeholders who are not present

1460
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,160
and

1461
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,920
if someone says we're trying to you know

1462
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,800
provide food to these people and group a

1463
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,480
says well we've got the food we could

1464
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,980
only do it we could do it if this group

1465
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,859
would only do this next piece and that's

1466
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:00,839
easy and that group stands up and says

1467
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:02,819
no it's not easy we can't do that until

1468
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,500
this other group does their piece which

1469
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,359
should be easy and that group stands up

1470
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:08,280
and says no that isn't easy there's

1471
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,559
these other things it becomes a real

1472
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,000
tangle and you got to break through that

1473
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,780
that Log Jam

1474
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,920
another another situation of

1475
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,260
examples like this are say Women's

1476
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,500
Health Care in the U.S or water quality

1477
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,260
in Detroit or Jackson Mississippi or the

1478
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,200
Texas power grid or infrastructure in

1479
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,119
Puerto Rico or something like that I

1480
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,300
hope I just didn't get too political

1481
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,720
so also in there the PTP standard came

1482
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,740
up and

1483
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,180
PTP worked because they put a clock at

1484
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,160
the end of the Nick chip

1485
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,780
and if you have clocked at the end of

1486
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,760
each Nick chip and wires between them

1487
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,520
there's no Jitter there's no delay and

1488
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,660
there's nothing getting in the way

1489
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,180
between these things exchanging time

1490
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,980
and

1491
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,980
for normal use I'm told you can get that

1492
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,040
down to three four nanoseconds if you're

1493
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,140
somebody like white rabbit at CERN where

1494
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,760
they put a whole lot of work into these

1495
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,400
things and they will

1496
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,500
do physics experiments between I think

1497
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,319
Switzerland and Italy they can get sub

1498
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,380
nanosecond accuracy and picoseconds of

1499
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,960
precision out of Precision Time protocol

1500
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,720
PTP switches cost about a hundred times

1501
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,420
more per Port than a normal ethernet

1502
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,000
switch so PTP is not something that's

1503
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,980
going to be widely Deployable soon the

1504
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,599
other aspect of that is people and their

1505
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,299
people run only time on their timing

1506
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:38,579
Network they don't do anything else

1507
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:41,400
my understanding was that you may recall

1508
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,140
that a few years ago they did an

1509
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,339
experiment where they thought they may

1510
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:45,839
have demonstrated something worked

1511
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,119
faster than time faster than the speed

1512
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,040
of light and

1513
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,020
that upset about that concerned a bunch

1514
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:52,920
of people

1515
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,740
the labs the restricted access Labs

1516
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,180
where they do this stuff they take

1517
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,579
pictures of everything when you walk in

1518
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:01,500
the room when you do something and when

1519
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,480
you leave the room you got pictures of

1520
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,980
everything

1521
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,500
in pouring over the results the BNC

1522
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,119
connectors for this have a registration

1523
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,640
mark on both the Jack and the plug they

1524
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,859
found one plug that had that was set at

1525
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:15,839
90 degrees and wasn't snapped up when

1526
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,700
they snapped it up their error went away

1527
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,559
and you know the speed of light was was

1528
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:22,380
reconfirmed again

1529
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,680
foreign

1530
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,980
closer because I'm almost out of time uh

1531
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,780
I'm not going to talk about this

1532
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,760
self-serving stuff I did with gnu Auto

1533
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,520
content automake even though it goes the

1534
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,680
bottom line is

1535
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,559
I ended up uh doing the build chain for

1536
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,960
the MDS what became the MDS switch

1537
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,880
series I don't know what a fabric switch

1538
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,460
is but I can I got the build tool chain

1539
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,680
for it and and they can do all that fun

1540
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,520
stuff uh that was cool the trick is I

1541
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,660
still haven't wrapped my brain around

1542
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,640
non-recursive make

1543
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,020
stuff

1544
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,020
so I finished my Cisco contract in

1545
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:04,500
December of 2004 and my ex soon to be X

1546
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,299
and I decided that we should do a

1547
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:09,000
driving trip that was lovely

1548
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,960
um

1549
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,119
I got back from that trip and asked Paul

1550
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:15,059
vixi if I could mooch some space from

1551
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:18,000
him at ISC for a desk and he went sure

1552
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,040
they'd already been hosting a rack for

1553
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,720
the ntp project I thought man I could

1554
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,280
easily get into the rack and do fun

1555
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,240
things

1556
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,880
I'm at Margaret in 2005 and I was glad

1557
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,559
she lived in southern Oregon because if

1558
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,180
I got to drive six hours away from the

1559
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,099
bay I'd rather drive six hours North to

1560
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:34,500
Oregon than forgive me six hours South

1561
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,980
to Los Angeles

1562
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:41,280
somewhere in the 2009 or 2010 All Hands

1563
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,780
meeting at ISE

1564
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:46,020
they did uh seven habits training which

1565
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,460
was great at the bottom of the seven

1566
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,920
habits they said the seven habits are

1567
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,440
based on a foundation of good character

1568
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,900
everybody agreed to that and what I

1569
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,900
noticed was while it's true people have

1570
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,480
different definitions of good character

1571
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,880
so that ties into what I was talking

1572
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,099
about before and I had an organizational

1573
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:08,819
home and we could do fun things right

1574
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:11,520
after that uh vixi just announced that

1575
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,660
he wanted to go off and do other

1576
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:15,359
different things which was cool but it

1577
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,040
also meant that they were going to stop

1578
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,380
fund their non-fun unfunded mandates

1579
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,900
which was us the rack was safe my office

1580
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,260
was not so I shifted and I moved to the

1581
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:29,579
rest of it and to

1582
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:31,740
quickly wrap up because I've got like a

1583
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,359
minute or so

1584
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,760
um I decided this I didn't want to do an

1585
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,339
ntp Foundation because that was focused

1586
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:40,799
on ntp I wanted to do a network time

1587
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,359
Foundation because the issue the big

1588
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:44,160
issue there is synchronizing time over

1589
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,599
Networks

1590
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,440
so I started ntf I got the paperwork I

1591
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,700
got some money

1592
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,599
there was a whirlwind trip to get the

1593
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:56,339
paperwork to the expediters in

1594
01:01:56,339 --> 01:01:59,160
California pick it up go to Oregon go to

1595
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,579
the Oregon state capitol get the

1596
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:03,720
registration drive right down to the

1597
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,460
bank open the account so I can talk to

1598
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,619
our first supporters and they can wire

1599
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:09,900
money to us for the trip it was a

1600
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,220
session

1601
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,160
so let's see what's next

1602
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,980
a couple more sayings along the way

1603
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,780
um

1604
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,720
they're fun there will be suckage it's a

1605
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,180
nice easy way to do things

1606
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:28,500
um another one I realized is that

1607
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,780
I'm always happy to work with people of

1608
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,400
good character who are competent and

1609
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,540
collaborative

1610
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:37,760
and the other thing I will say is

1611
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,900
uh zooming ahead

1612
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,160
one of the other things Samuel Johnson

1613
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,400
wrote that I really like is integrity

1614
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,359
without knowledge is weak and useless

1615
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,540
knowledge without Integrity is dangerous

1616
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,099
and Dreadful

1617
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:59,339
and I pay attention to that because it

1618
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:01,200
brings me to my next

1619
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,720
interesting point signal the noise ratio

1620
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,700
people are used to

1621
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,380
the really important one to me is

1622
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,020
information attitude ratio if you're

1623
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,059
coming at me with information I'm good

1624
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,339
if you come up with attitude

1625
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:17,040
I can be less resourceful

1626
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,400
so here we go uh I farm Network time

1627
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,200
Foundation we've got a bunch of stuff

1628
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,740
and I'm really sorry that I rambled on

1629
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,140
about something a bit longer because I

1630
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,799
really wanted to mention more about ntp

1631
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:34,500
and and the Kronos project and Linux PTP

1632
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,099
and sinki frequency transfer and spew a

1633
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:39,900
bit about the general timestamp API

1634
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,540
because time stamps are useless but you

1635
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,640
know a 32 or 64-bit timestamp there's

1636
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,680
not much you can do with that there's no

1637
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,540
meta information about it you don't know

1638
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,400
what time scale it was taken in

1639
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,740
you don't know what errors it has not

1640
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,579
nothing

1641
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,500
you can't even easily move it to another

1642
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,359
system but if you have a fatter

1643
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,980
timestamp with more useful information

1644
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,619
in it you can move that around you can

1645
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:03,780
you can convert it to other time scales

1646
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:07,260
you can compare it you can

1647
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,420
do useful things you can embed it into

1648
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,420
SQL databases and life is good

1649
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,780
so I think I'm down to about

1650
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,000
well I'm just going to do it this way

1651
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,740
this was one that I heard and

1652
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,619
a company told me a company I heard

1653
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:28,079
about read the Taos farmer stories and

1654
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,420
the management had a decree from now on

1655
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,000
now on we will no longer have problems

1656
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,180
we will only have opportunities and not

1657
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,740
long after that a worker told their

1658
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,900
manager I need help with an

1659
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,160
insurmountable opportunity

1660
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,119
so there we are and uh I really

1661
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:49,980
appreciate being invited to speak here

1662
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,260
and I would say I hope there are some

1663
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:57,079
questions but I'm over by two minutes so

1664
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:03,909
[Applause]

1665
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,520
thank you
