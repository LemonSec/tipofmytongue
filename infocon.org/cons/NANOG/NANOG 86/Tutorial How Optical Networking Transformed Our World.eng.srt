[Music]

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,379
for our next presenter I would like to

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,120
welcome to the screen Jeff Bennett

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,460
presenting optical fiber capacity limits

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,280
where do we go next Jeff is director

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,619
Solutions and Technology at infinera

9
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,539
this is Jeff's second time presenting at

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:19,859
nanog and it's a pleasure to have him

11
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,080
speaking with us today welcome Jeff

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,920
thank you very much Kat can you guys

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,210
hear me okay

14
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,000
[Applause]

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,460
I'm hoping you can

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,160
um I'm going to share my presentation

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,219
slides now

18
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,100
so it should be the screen

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,160
and then share

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,620
and hopefully you see that

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,739
so uh yeah

22
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,239
thank you everyone for the uh

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,520
opportunity to present again

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,219
um and uh another subject close to my

25
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,379
heart how Optical networking transformed

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:00:59,640
our world

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,760
um it's a big claim and I'm hoping that

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,580
I can uh justify it

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,840
so

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,180
basically what I'm talking about here is

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,760
the fact that back in 2020 we celebrated

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,100
a 50-year anniversary

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,299
and it was 50 years of the combination

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,520
of low loss optical fiber and

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,320
semiconductor lasers

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,900
because if you think about it these are

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,659
the oxygen that feeds the internet

38
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:30,000
everything that I'm everyone in this

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,720
room actually uh is doing not only for

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,439
your day jobs as Network operators but

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,380
also when you go home uh anytime at work

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,840
you need the kind of capacity that

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,299
optical fiber and semiconductor lasers

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,040
deliver

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,600
so

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,200
could we actually operate the internet

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
any other way

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,799
um so could we use copper could we use

49
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,560
microwave technology well the answer is

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,100
no because optical fiber is on a totally

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,439
different capacity trajectory from these

52
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,719
Technologies it's great to use ethernet

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,380
cables to plug into your network at home

54
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,560
or or perhaps at work it's great to use

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,959
wireless technology in certain

56
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,640
circumstances because it's so convenient

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,860
but it's never going to deliver the kind

58
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,500
of capacity that optical fiber can

59
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,379
provide over long distances

60
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,800
so what about satellites we hear a lot

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,599
about the starlink constellation and um

62
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,800
it's a tricky number to come up with

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,940
this I did find a an FCC uh filing that

64
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,680
mentioned the total capacity of the

65
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,840
starlink constellation might be as high

66
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,180
as 24 terabits per second by the way if

67
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,879
anyone has better numbers on that uh I'd

68
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,800
be happy to accept them because I always

69
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,319
use this number in in presentations

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,540
but if you think about it that's about

71
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,560
the same uh capacity as a single fiber

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,200
pair on one transatlantic submarine

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
cable

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,340
um it's you know there is no way that

75
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,239
this constellation uh could replace

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,340
fiber in terms of capacity so you know

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,500
why is it there it's there for things

78
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,560
like rural Broadband or uh mobile

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,680
broadband Technologies or where we need

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,480
to bypass some kind of State Control

81
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,459
we've seen in Ukraine for example

82
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,040
starlink terminals being activated to

83
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,580
provide connectivity

84
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,980
so these two technologies really came

85
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,280
together Back in 1970 that was the date

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
when researchers realized it could

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,680
actually work because they both have a

88
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,980
very very long history of development

89
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,319
uh and that history involves multiple

90
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,360
Nobel prizes and of course the end

91
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,060
result is uh is feeding the internet as

92
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,340
we know it today

93
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,159
so I'd like to give you a a very brief

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,459
and exciting history of optical fiber

95
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,099
and it dates back quite a long time

96
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,080
there's a an experiment that was first

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,180
done by a Swiss physicist John Danielle

98
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,739
collidor

99
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,379
um where he trapped light inside a tube

100
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,420
of water but actually many of you might

101
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,040
be thinking well hang on isn't that the

102
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,599
Tyndall experiment

103
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,478
well actually John Tyndall did this much

104
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,720
later 1859 uh and he he was

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,759
demonstrating the phenomenon of total

106
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,220
internal reflection the reason we think

107
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,080
of this is the Tyndall experiment is

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,759
that John Tindall was a bit like the

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,220
Neil deGrasse Tyson of his day he was a

110
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,820
fantastic science communicator and so

111
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,560
the experiment tended to be associated

112
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,020
with him now I'm going to take my life

113
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,639
in my hands here and and hope that

114
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,720
you're going to be able to see this

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,759
video uh it's actually from the Harvard

116
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,639
Natural Sciences Department uh it's a

117
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,160
fantastic demonstration do this at home

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,020
with your kids it's a as long as you

119
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,780
don't use this kind of helium neon laser

120
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,320
you'll be fine just use a a green laser

121
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,460
pointer

122
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,080
um and you can set that up in a similar

123
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,639
way but you've got a bottle full of

124
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,979
water you shine the laser through the

125
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,840
hole that you you put in in the bottle

126
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,940
of water and the water is being held

127
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,500
there at the moment because you see the

128
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,199
guys releasing this uh plug and as soon

129
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,820
as he releases that it will allow the

130
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,639
water to flow out and you can see that

131
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,919
the light is being trapped inside that

132
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,620
tube of water you can even see that it's

133
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,900
bouncing off the insides of the tube of

134
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,180
water and that's total internal

135
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,580
reflection it's because the water has a

136
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,139
higher refractive index than the air

137
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,360
around it great experiment to do with

138
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,180
with kids in fact

139
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,320
so

140
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,199
what we see then is a a series of

141
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,020
developments involving fiber optics but

142
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,780
not necessarily for communication in

143
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,259
1930 Heinrich lamb used bundles of

144
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,500
fibers as a medical endoscope now of

145
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,199
course you know many of us have actually

146
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,060
experienced endoscopy perhaps not in a

147
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,280
pleasant environment but it's an

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,820
important diagnostic tool in medicine

149
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,840
um and and later on Dorinda Singh coined

150
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,660
the term fiber optics uh uh in in

151
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,400
talking about this kind of Technology

152
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,000
but this was in the context of endoscopy

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,100
and in fact there's an entire evolution

154
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,120
of uh fiber uh foreign endoscopy

155
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,500
purposes

156
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,740
but it was really in 1965 we see the

157
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,000
first idea of of using fiber optics as a

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,400
communication system uh Manfred borner

159
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,639
who worked for Telefunken in Germany and

160
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,160
also Sir Charles Cal who worked at

161
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,780
standard telephone and cables in the

162
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,900
United Kingdom he made so many

163
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,160
contributions uh to the topic he's often

164
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
remembered as the father of fiber optics

165
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,199
um and he's he laid down this this goal

166
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,720
that if you could produce an optical

167
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,840
fiber which had a loss of less than 20

168
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
DB per kilometer that could be useful

169
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,259
for telecommunications purposes and it

170
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,580
wasn't just for that but but you know

171
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,500
for all of his contributions

172
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,900
um he actually shared the 2009 Nobel

173
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,380
Prize for physics

174
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,240
1970 is the magic day because of the

175
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,460
magic year because a group of

176
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,740
researchers at Corning uh actually

177
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,259
managed to make low loss optical fiber

178
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,800
and they beat uh cow's 20 DB number by

179
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,960
quarter margin because they produced a

180
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,160
17 DB per kilometer fiber now three DBS

181
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,419
doesn't sound a lot but it's actually

182
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,180
half the attenuation because it's a

183
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,880
logarithmic scale so Donald Keck Robert

184
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,060
Maura Peter Schultz are highly renowned

185
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,460
for for their contribution in this

186
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,819
respect now notice the wavelength of

187
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,300
light 630 nanometers now that's actually

188
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,599
in the visible spectrum it's a it's just

189
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,300
as red is starting to uh change into

190
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,319
Orange

191
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,639
and

192
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,160
um the the problem with uh certain

193
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,160
wavelengths of light is that they don't

194
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,800
always uh pass through glass in a

195
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,080
particular efficient way

196
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,860
but you can demonstrate again using a

197
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,900
safe laser pointer

198
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,259
um how this technique actually works

199
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,900
um if you don't fancy the uh the Tyndall

200
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,060
experiment this is my five-year service

201
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,400
award from infinera uh so I've got my

202
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,440
green laser pointer there green by the

203
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,139
way is the most visible color to the

204
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,899
human eye that's why I tend to use it

205
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,479
and you can see the the impurities in

206
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,159
the in the perspex block mean that we

207
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,140
can see the beam of light passing

208
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,059
through the block and as I turn the

209
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,339
laser pointer you can see it bouncing

210
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,399
off the top side of the uh of the

211
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,279
perspex block and this is how you create

212
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,000
fiber as a waveguide it traps the light

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,880
inside the Block in fact the way it

214
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,160
really works uh is that you have a

215
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,620
gradient of of uh of refractive index

216
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,740
and it's sort of guides The Light Within

217
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,740
the core of the fiber

218
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,800
so why is low loss so important

219
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,200
um now apologies I did use these slides

220
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,380
at the at the last uh meeting but I I do

221
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,640
think it's an important point to make

222
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,160
because if you've got a kilometer of

223
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,440
optical fiber with the kind of loss that

224
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,080
we were talking about as a goal for

225
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,200
telecommunications the 20 DB loss and

226
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
you managed to make the best Optical

227
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,620
detector in the world in other words

228
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,500
that it can reliably detect one single

229
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,360
Photon in the receiver

230
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,700
then how many photons do you need to put

231
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,899
into this Fiber Well a distance of one

232
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,700
kilometer you'd need a hundred photons

233
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,459
uh in at the transmitter but at two

234
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,260
kilometers you already need 10 000

235
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,440
photons and at 10 kilometers you need 10

236
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,560
to the power 20 photons that's a lot of

237
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,980
photons because the fiber is absorbing

238
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,320
so many of these photons as they pass

239
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,700
along it

240
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,820
so you know if you assume that there are

241
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,760
3.28 times 10 to the power 80 particles

242
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,980
in the observable universe and you've

243
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,680
got your single Photon detector with a

244
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
20 DB per kilometer loss fiber how far

245
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
can you can you go well it's of course

246
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,240
it's 42 kilometers you know it's it's a

247
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,220
it's like the answer to life the

248
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,480
universe and everything

249
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,959
that's with 20 DB per kilometer loss

250
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,519
fiber

251
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,279
but the the race then started to try to

252
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,839
drive down that uh attenuation and there

253
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,160
are a couple of ways that you can do

254
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,440
this one of the ways is move the

255
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,320
wavelength of light now in order to do

256
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,480
that the laser guys have to start

257
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,220
working harder because they have to

258
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,560
produce lasers that could work at longer

259
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,399
wavelengths of light 850 nanometers is

260
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,459
is actually just in the infrared if you

261
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,980
were to make an 850 nanometer

262
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,079
transmitter you wouldn't be able to see

263
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,760
the light that came from it but you

264
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,579
would see a red glow at the uh at the

265
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,980
transmitter itself as an artifact of the

266
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,260
way the light is produced uh the other

267
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,320
way the that this was done is in the

268
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,720
optical fiber the way it works you have

269
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,060
a core of higher refractive index glass

270
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,860
now you can do this a couple of

271
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,300
different ways you can put a little

272
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,660
sprinkle of titanium oxide which is the

273
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,060
same material that makes paint opaque by

274
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,100
the way uh you have a little sprinkle of

275
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,600
that in there and it raises the

276
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,180
refractive index of the core but they

277
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,980
they realize that instead of using

278
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,560
titanium oxide if you use germanium

279
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,620
oxide you you could end up lowering the

280
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,800
attenuation of the optical fiber and at

281
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,860
this wavelength of light back in 1973

282
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,660
they were getting close to the

283
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,240
theoretical minimum attenuation

284
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,760
so of course the way you do this is push

285
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,680
even further into the infrared so uh by

286
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,019
1976 longer wavelength lasers were

287
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,240
produced 1200 nanometers and then

288
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,220
finally we get to the wavelengths that

289
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,220
we use today 1550 nanometers that was

290
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,680
possible by the end of the 70s

291
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,579
um

292
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,880
and uh the the the attenuation of the

293
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,120
fiber at that time was about 0.2 DB per

294
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,120
kilometer and the theoretical minimum is

295
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,860
0.15

296
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,959
um and in fact we're getting quite close

297
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,320
to that now because commercial SMF 28

298
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
ultra low loss is already at 0.17 DB per

299
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,459
kilometer

300
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,860
so now with this wonderful low loss

301
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,079
fiber how many photons would we need for

302
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,620
42 kilometers uh well again assuming a

303
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,500
single Photon detector with the 1970

304
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,600
fiber of course we would need more

305
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,940
photons than than in the uh observable

306
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,820
universe but with this low loss fiber we

307
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,100
only need five photons that's the

308
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,980
difference that's the the achievement of

309
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,079
creating very very low attenuation

310
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,060
optical fiber

311
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,700
now the typical amplifier spacing that

312
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,320
we use in terrestrial network is about

313
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,839
100 kilometers we'd only need to put 50

314
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,720
photons in at the transmitter to get one

315
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,540
Photon out of uh at each of the

316
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,200
amplifier hops but in fact we put a lot

317
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,260
more photons than that into the fiber a

318
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,959
typical modulation symbol uh probably

319
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,480
contains about let's just count that one

320
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,200
two three four five six 10 to the 19

321
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,260
um uh photons in a in a typical

322
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,880
modulation symbol

323
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,880
now today we have over a billion

324
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,860
kilometers of optical fiber deployed I

325
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,060
really need to update that number

326
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,100
because I think it's way more than that

327
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,100
I've seen uh numbers as high as four or

328
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,339
five billion kilometers and a billion

329
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,660
kilometers you could wrap around the

330
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,320
earth 25 000 times and you know fiber is

331
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,680
becoming ubiquitous uh everywhere right

332
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,500
out into the local Loop even into the uh

333
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,019
the house that I'm talking to to you

334
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,399
from at the moment which is in the

335
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,399
middle of nowhere in the UK but I still

336
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,040
I'm able to get fiber uh in into the

337
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,440
home

338
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,260
okay let's change the uh the tack now to

339
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,320
this complementary technology uh and

340
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,300
I'll be looking at the history of

341
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,519
semiconductor lasers

342
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,220
so uh again it's a it's an interesting

343
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,380
topic it's based on an entirely

344
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,240
different set of mechanisms and

345
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,060
different chemistries different elements

346
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,339
um but it dates back really to around

347
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,700
about 1917 with Albert Einstein

348
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,380
describing the concept of stimulated

349
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,540
emission now stimulated emission is

350
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,620
where you you have a um

351
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,240
some material where the electrons have

352
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,079
been stimulated you um or that they've

353
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,160
actually been excited they've been

354
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,139
they've been given some energy they're

355
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,540
all in excited States now and of course

356
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,399
excited States will eventually Decay

357
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,940
randomly that spontaneous emission but

358
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,940
if you want to uh use that light in a

359
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,040
useful way you have stimulated emission

360
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,680
you can stimulate it by sending a photon

361
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,079
of exactly the right wavelength past all

362
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,199
of these excited Photon electrons and

363
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,600
they drop down at the same time and they

364
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,720
produce light of the same wavelength as

365
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,000
the uh as the photon that stim related

366
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,480
that that little uh Cascade so Einstein

367
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,300
described this concept and in 1937

368
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,699
Rudolph lydenburg experimentally

369
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,000
confirmed uh stimulated emissions

370
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,199
lydenburg's a very interesting guy he

371
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,199
escaped from uh Germany

372
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,019
um you know in about 1932 that was just

373
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,440
uh before Hitler uh came to power in in

374
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,620
Germany and he was responsible he he

375
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,959
brought a lot of

376
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,440
um German physicists over in the 1930s

377
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,660
not the not the Operation Paperclip

378
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,880
stuff after the war but

379
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,920
um physicists that needed to escape from

380
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,279
Germany uh lydenburg was responsible for

381
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,720
finding them

382
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,660
um positions in the United States uh uh

383
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,860
so that they could they could continue

384
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,740
to work

385
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,500
uh in 1939 Valentin fabricant in the

386
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,480
Soviet Union he predicted the use of

387
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,240
stimulated emission to amplify short

388
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,079
waves now short waves at that point

389
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,940
um he was actually describing microwaves

390
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,440
typically

391
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,839
um uh which are a much longer wavelength

392
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,220
than light

393
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,760
um but in in 1947 uh will they see lamb

394
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,120
and RC Rutherford they demonstrated uh

395
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,880
stimulated emission in hydrogen Spectra

396
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,600
so this was a a gas medium for

397
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,820
stimulated emission and they won the uh

398
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,600
the 1955 Nobel Prize for physics yeah

399
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,300
Alfred Kessler proposed the idea of

400
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,759
optical pumping now he proposed the idea

401
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,699
in 1950 he actually shared the 1966

402
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,339
Nobel Prize for physics and Optical

403
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,959
pumping is the idea you have to get

404
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,419
these electrons into an excited state so

405
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,939
one way is you shine some light into the

406
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,880
material uh and and and pump them up to

407
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,000
uh these excited States

408
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,059
so we we see all of these various ideas

409
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,439
floating around and by 1951 a guy called

410
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,799
Joseph Weber proposed the Mazer the

411
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,959
microwave amplification by stimulated

412
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,299
emission of radiation and this is just

413
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,360
after the war radar uh during the second

414
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,539
world war took many strides forward uh

415
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:40,559
and and actually he was using radar type

416
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,580
equipment that's why he was focused on

417
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,320
microwaves at the time uh Webb is an

418
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,520
interesting guy by the way because he

419
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
also predicted gravitational waves uh

420
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,140
and those of you who follow sort of

421
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,940
popular physics might be aware that

422
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,620
we've only very recently been able to

423
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,980
measure gravitational waves

424
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,120
then a group of of physicists uh uh

425
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,460
prokarov from the Soviet Union and then

426
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,360
towns and and uh and bassoff uh townses

427
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,919
from the United States I'm trying to

428
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,140
remember whether bazov is uh Russian I'm

429
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,020
not not sure but anyway they shared the

430
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,679
1964 Nobel Prize for physics uh and and

431
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,720
this was a this was starting to bring

432
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,740
all of this Mesa uh technology together

433
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,080
uh what was really interesting

434
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,120
some of the greatest physicists around

435
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,260
at the time

436
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,200
actually thought that the Mesa would be

437
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,880
impossible they said oh it breaks the

438
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,620
Heisenberg uncertainty principle and

439
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,559
these are guys like Niels Bohr who uh is

440
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,400
like he's a giant in uh in quantum

441
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,799
physics John Von Neumann many of you may

442
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,960
be aware of Von Neumann from from early

443
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,320
Computing uh Theory and and they said oh

444
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,120
no it's not possible but you know they

445
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,500
would proved wrong

446
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,780
so uh what happened in 1957 uh a group

447
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,679
from Bell labs and uh uh Professor Gould

448
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,900
from Columbia University they produced

449
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,559
an optical Mazer now

450
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,020
the Bell Labs guys wanted to keep on

451
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,600
calling it an optical Mazer but Gould

452
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,120
actually said no we should call it a

453
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,160
laser because it's light amplification

454
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,400
by stimulated emission of radiation now

455
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,880
this was theorized uh at the time but

456
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,700
then uh in 1960 Theodore mayman actually

457
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,740
demonstrated it he demonstrated it in

458
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,520
the lab using a pulsed Ruby laser so his

459
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,679
gain medium was it was a chunk of

460
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,500
synthetic Ruby Crystal and he used an

461
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,559
old photographic flash bulb as the

462
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,260
optical pump now obviously that is

463
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,960
literally pulsed because every time you

464
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,280
want to create

465
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,020
a pulse of light you have to put in a

466
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,900
new flash bulb not very practical

467
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,520
so

468
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,160
um maybe by using different materials we

469
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,419
could we could get something a little

470
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,160
bit more practical well bass off and

471
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,500
Javan in 1960 they proposed the

472
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,020
semiconductor laser so the the gain

473
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,299
material now is a solid-state

474
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,140
semiconductor and then uh in 1962 Robert

475
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,840
Hall showed the pulsed semiconductor

476
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,559
laser now again it's a pulsed uh device

477
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,940
not very practical not only because it

478
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,340
was quite large but also it had to be

479
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,039
cooled with liquid nitrogen to to uh to

480
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,780
actually lathe

481
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,240
so

482
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,980
1970 kind of brings all of these

483
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,140
different ideas together

484
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,039
and then convert it into a practical uh

485
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,299
device because uh jorah's alpharoff uh

486
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,059
who who shared the 1964 Nobel Prize for

487
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,360
physics and then Hayashi and Parish uh I

488
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,679
think they were well they were certainly

489
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,380
in the U.S may have been a bell Labs

490
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,600
um they brought together a device that

491
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,820
worked at room temperature it operated

492
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,640
in continuous mode it was based on a

493
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,320
semiconductor which means it's very

494
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,500
small and and they finally sort of bring

495
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,140
together this practical laser that's why

496
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,260
the 1970 date uh is is seen as so

497
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,240
pivotal

498
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,600
so I was actually 10 years old in 1970

499
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,820
which meant uh the year before I'd

500
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,419
watched uh Apollo 11 land on the moon

501
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:26,520
and I still had to wait another 10 years

502
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,380
for my first computer which was a

503
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,679
Sinclair ZX Spectrum

504
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,620
so the parallel developments of the

505
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,080
laser and fiber then really started to

506
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,720
kick off because we start with this with

507
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,480
with this sort of breakthrough where a

508
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,460
low enough loss optical fiber is

509
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,919
achieved and a practical room

510
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,840
temperature continuous operation

511
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,720
semiconductor laser is achieved so how

512
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,299
do we make that scale

513
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,580
um so we have a few different options

514
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,760
with uh with optical fiber uh one of the

515
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,059
options is to Simply put a single uh

516
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,360
beam of light along the fiber and if you

517
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,280
want to increase the amount of data that

518
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,020
you're transmitting then instead of

519
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,840
operating at 2.5 gigabits per second you

520
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,940
you might increase the wavelength data

521
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,280
rate to let's say 10 gigabits per second

522
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,559
now in order to do that you've got to

523
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,500
change the electronics you've got to

524
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,900
have more advanced circuitry in order to

525
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,080
do it and by the way you may also once

526
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,760
you start transmitting at that higher

527
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,980
data rate you may also start to

528
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,600
encounter

529
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,700
um bad things in the optical fiber that

530
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,020
you have to deal with for example

531
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,600
chromatic dispersion

532
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,240
um so an alternative is oh maybe you

533
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,039
could make things scale by putting

534
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,280
multiple colors on the same fiber

535
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,679
um and of course then you you're getting

536
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,740
uh you don't have to depend on higher

537
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,080
data rate Electronics uh to keep

538
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,480
boosting capacity you can just go

539
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,919
parallel

540
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,559
but you can do both it depends on where

541
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,799
you are in the technology cycle

542
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,940
sometimes you get an Electronics

543
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,740
breakthrough that allows you to transmit

544
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,080
at higher data rates or sometimes you

545
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,940
may get an optical breakthrough where

546
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,179
you have more Precision in the Optics in

547
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:16,980
order to put more wavelengths onto the

548
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,340
fiber

549
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,720
now there are various things of course

550
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,299
that we need to appreciate about optical

551
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,460
fiber I've mentioned attenuation already

552
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,340
the the drive towards low attenuation

553
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,000
optical fiber so let's take a look at

554
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,059
the at this uh challenge of wavelengths

555
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,000
because the very early lasers were

556
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,580
produced at uh visible wavelengths and

557
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,240
then

558
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,940
uh laser research had to be done laser

559
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,640
breakthroughs had to be made to allow us

560
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,500
to transmit it longer and longer

561
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,539
wavelengths and this is why it's

562
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,780
important on the vertical axis here I'm

563
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,260
showing attenuation in DB uh DBS per

564
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,580
kilometer

565
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,980
on the horizontal axis is the wavelength

566
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,320
now that's shown in microns you multiply

567
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,200
by a thousand for for nanometers but you

568
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,580
can see

569
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,799
um there's that it's shorter wavelengths

570
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,039
there's a high attenuation and the the

571
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,020
phenomenon that causes that is really

572
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,700
scattering

573
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,280
so Rayleigh scattering is is literally

574
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,980
where photons will bounce off something

575
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,620
and the something is usually

576
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,159
um uh something in the material itself

577
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,080
it's the it's the molecules or the or

578
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,260
the atoms uh within the material itself

579
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,900
at longer wavelengths the attenuation is

580
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,380
dominated by infrared absorption this is

581
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,799
where the um the photons are interacting

582
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,539
with the molecules and they make them

583
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:49,020
vibrate uh and as they make them vibrate

584
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,320
the energy of the photon is absorbed

585
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,059
um and and those longer wavelengths you

586
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,980
can see the attenuation start to rise

587
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,380
again the problem is that the both of

588
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,559
these are sort of intrinsic to the

589
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,419
material that we're using in other words

590
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,539
glass you know silica which is the uh

591
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,400
the material we use to create optical

592
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,740
fiber

593
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,980
uh now lasers had to evolve back in the

594
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,020
mid 70s we were using gallium arsenide

595
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,419
as the semiconductor

596
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,760
um with wavelengths of around about uh

597
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,419
0.8 microns or 800 nanometers and that

598
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,539
was over multi-mode fiber as well

599
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,600
um by the 1980s we were using more

600
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,020
complex semiconductor materials so a

601
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,179
sort of mixture of indium gallium

602
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,400
Arsenic and phosphorus now indium and

603
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,520
gallium are in what I used to call group

604
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,840
three

605
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,779
um they call it a different name now

606
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,059
um but but then you have arsenic and

607
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,260
phosphorus in what used to be called

608
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,940
group five so this is why they're

609
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,559
sometimes referred to as three five

610
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,020
semiconductors and this is a kind of

611
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,559
mixture of of these uh of these elements

612
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,980
in order to tune the the laser

613
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,900
performance so that it operates at

614
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,000
longer wavelengths in this case 1.3

615
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,240
microns or 1300 nanometers

616
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,840
a lot of early uh single mode fiber uh

617
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,480
deployments in the 1980s were actually

618
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,539
done at 1300 nanometers because that was

619
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,700
the wavelength you could build lasers to

620
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,620
operate at

621
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,539
now of course it's not the ideal

622
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:27,360
wavelength in the fiber because it still

623
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,820
has quite High attenuation at 1300

624
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,419
nanometers so by the 1990s uh another

625
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,659
sort of flavor of uh in gas P was was

626
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,360
used uh that allowed us to transmit at

627
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,419
15 50 nanometers or 1.55 microns

628
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,539
and at that point you can see we're at

629
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,940
the minimum attenuation of the optical

630
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,980
fiber some of you may have heard of the

631
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,779
c-band and the L band

632
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,580
that's that's where what we're talking

633
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,580
about here the C and the L band uh from

634
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,520
around about 15 30 nanometers to 1565

635
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,419
that's the c-band 1565 to about 1625 is

636
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,179
the uh L band

637
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,880
and the lasers that that they were using

638
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,980
at this point are more advanced as well

639
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,140
they're single mode lasers with external

640
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,960
modulators in order to achieve higher

641
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,200
data rates uh for transmission

642
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,500
I have to mention a major breakthrough

643
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,600
and it was it was done almost at the

644
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,059
same time really by Sir David Payne in

645
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,460
in the United Kingdom Emmanuel de severe

646
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,159
Bell labs and this was the erbium doped

647
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,860
fiber amplifier so that was around about

648
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,559
1986 when the edford was uh discovered

649
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:41,340
and what what does it do well you could

650
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,080
you could basically say that it

651
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,900
triggered the dense wavelength division

652
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,539
multiplexing Market the ability to

653
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,700
transmit with many wavelengths on the

654
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,740
same fiber because even with very low

655
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,380
loss optical fiber the attenuation means

656
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,200
we need to amplify the signal and we

657
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,919
need a cost-effective way to amplify all

658
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,059
of the wavelengths that we're

659
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,880
transmitting ideally in the same piece

660
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,419
of equipment so if we couldn't do that

661
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,700
imagine the situation this would be an

662
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,700
amplifier site where you have to break

663
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,980
apart all the wavelengths you send each

664
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,260
wavelength to its own amplifier and then

665
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,480
you put them back together again now

666
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,880
that might work fine for two three four

667
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,980
wavelengths but when you scale it to

668
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,679
like 80 wavelengths then really you need

669
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,380
a single stage device and that's what

670
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,720
the ad for

671
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,320
really produced so the adver is a it's a

672
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,659
length of fiber that you dope with the

673
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,600
element erbium you optically pump it and

674
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,279
then the data wavelengths that pass

675
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,720
through are given additional Power by

676
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,200
that length of doped fiber

677
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,580
so

678
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,179
um

679
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:55,860
let's take a look at some Fiber

680
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,900
impairments and one of the main

681
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,640
impairments that we experience is

682
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,440
something called dispersion

683
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,640
now dispersion is the phenomenon whereby

684
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,419
a modulation pulse ends up being spread

685
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:10,320
out

686
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,080
and there's a reason why it's spread out

687
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,600
something is causing it to spread out

688
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,419
now there are various reasons why it

689
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,919
might spread out one reason might be

690
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:28,520
modal dispersion and modal dispersion is

691
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,200
occurs in multi-mode fiber

692
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,000
multimodifibers sometimes still used

693
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,200
today and it used to be used everywhere

694
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,179
but multi-mode fiber is where the fiber

695
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,179
core diameter is more than about 10

696
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:46,980
times the wavelength that you're

697
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,039
transmitting and the reason that we used

698
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,620
to use multi-mode Fiber is that was the

699
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,380
fiber that we could produce right

700
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,460
um it it's a it's a very precise uh

701
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,140
Engineering Process and the first kind

702
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,260
of fiber that that was workable happened

703
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,419
to be a have a fairly large core

704
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:07,860
diameter

705
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,840
but when you have a large core diameter

706
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,880
what happens is that this nice clean

707
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,860
modulation pulse on the left hand side

708
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,720
there by the time it gets through the

709
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,200
fiber parts of that modulation pulse may

710
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,559
have taken different paths so the parts

711
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,299
of the pulse that travel right down the

712
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,799
center of the fiber they get there

713
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,840
quicker but the parts that bounce off

714
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,880
the uh you know the insides of the

715
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,159
waveguide they take a bit longer and so

716
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,080
the pulses is actually spread out that's

717
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,899
called modal dispersion how do you solve

718
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,419
modal dispersion you use single mode

719
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,700
fiber and single mode fiber is where the

720
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,039
fiber core diameter is very narrow it's

721
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,440
less than 10 times the wavelength of the

722
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,380
light that we're transmitting now you

723
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,120
you can see that

724
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,880
if you wanted to if you used different

725
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,159
wavelengths in today's single mode fiber

726
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,860
used very very short wavelengths it

727
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,960
would not behave as single mode fiber

728
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,200
because the wavelengths might be shorter

729
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,779
than than this sort of 10 of the of the

730
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,580
fiber core diameter

731
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,380
so with single mode fiber there's really

732
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,260
only room for one pathway through the

733
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,980
fiber a single mode and the end result

734
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,320
is there's almost no modal dispersion so

735
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,240
that's why you know we don't tend to

736
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,860
talk about model dispersion much these

737
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,200
days because we we always use single

738
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,140
mode fiber

739
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,919
now

740
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:29,580
um

741
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,760
another kind of dispersion is chromatic

742
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,340
dispersion now chromatic

743
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,779
um I think it comes from the Greek

744
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:39,539
meaning color uh and

745
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,779
um again the dispersion in this case is

746
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:46,380
caused because a modulation symbol is

747
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,659
actually made up of a of a spread of

748
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,200
different colors now in reality

749
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,659
all of these colors they're in the

750
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,880
infrared we can't see them

751
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,100
um but you know for the purposes of of

752
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,679
uh discussion uh I'll I'll use like a

753
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,960
little Rainbow of colors here and

754
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,940
there's a key Point

755
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,220
um when different colors of light travel

756
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,720
through glass

757
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,600
the lower frequencies or the longer

758
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,720
wavelengths travel faster so the red end

759
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,700
of the visible spectrum would travel

760
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,640
faster through glass than the blue end

761
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,120
and the end result is that the the red

762
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,520
portions of the uh of the modulation

763
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,500
pulse get there before the blue portions

764
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,919
and the pulse is spread out because of

765
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,399
color and you know given that the symbol

766
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,140
is actually infrared we can't see it

767
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,120
it's because of they're at different

768
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,679
frequencies

769
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,299
now

770
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,360
when we look at optical fiber

771
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,080
um

772
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,539
people realize that chromatic dispersion

773
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:51,659
would be a problem so good old g652

774
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,419
which is you know it's the most widely

775
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,120
deployed fiber um in long-haul networks

776
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,140
in the world

777
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,760
it's zero dispersion point was actually

778
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,840
engineered to be uh at 1310 nanometers

779
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,659
because remember

780
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:11,399
1310 nanometers those were the lasers

781
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,580
that we could actually manufacture when

782
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,980
g652 was first designed

783
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,440
and this is the total dispersion profile

784
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,059
in blue

785
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,159
um the red line is actually the material

786
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,200
dispersion this is the dispersion the

787
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,720
critic dispersion of the glass itself

788
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,320
but optical fiber is a waveguide and

789
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,720
there is a waveguide dispersion

790
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,899
component you can engineer the waveguide

791
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:38,760
dispersion

792
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,679
um component you can't really engineer

793
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:42,299
the material dispersion unless you

794
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:44,340
change the kind of material that you're

795
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,539
using

796
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,039
um but you can engineer the waveguide

797
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,380
dispersion and that's how you could set

798
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,840
the zero dispersion wavelength of the

799
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,240
fiber

800
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,019
now another kind of uh dispersion is

801
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:02,940
caused by the fact that light is uh has

802
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,960
different

803
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,799
um axes of oscillation so we think about

804
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,580
this as uh an X and A Y axis the z-axis

805
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,918
is actually the direction of propagation

806
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,359
of the light that's the direction that

807
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,418
light is traveling in but as it travels

808
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:20,040
um the light has energy that's

809
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,119
oscillating in in an X and A Y uh axis

810
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,379
now optical fiber has tiny radial

811
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,679
variations so you could imagine at an

812
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,339
instant in time that one of these

813
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,260
polarizations might move more quickly

814
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,839
than the other so in this case I'm just

815
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,859
going to show that the Y uh axis is

816
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:46,379
moving faster than the x-axis now in

817
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,899
real fiber unfortunately that can vary

818
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:51,719
as you go along the fiber so sometimes

819
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,960
the y-axis will be the fast mode but a

820
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,399
little bit further along the fiber it

821
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,740
might be the x

822
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,080
axis that is the fast mode but for

823
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,060
Simplicity you can you can see that that

824
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,560
What's Happening Here is that the

825
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,180
different parts of the modulation pulse

826
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,859
might be spread out

827
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:10,200
now that's PMD or polarization mode

828
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,880
dispersion

829
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,060
now we can compensate for some of these

830
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,740
Technologies and we can do it in various

831
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,859
ways one of the ways we can do do this

832
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:23,220
is uh with chromatic dispersion when the

833
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,440
industry moved from 2.5 gigabits per

834
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,599
second to 10 gigabits per second per

835
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,540
wavelength that was around in the late

836
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,040
90s

837
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,079
um we found that we needed to put some

838
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,040
dispersion compensating fiber into the

839
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,680
network and you can see the roles the

840
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,740
spools of DCF are actually located in in

841
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,940
the amplifier sites and in the terminal

842
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,619
now when PMD became a problem

843
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,960
um we act this was a a little bit of an

844
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,180
issue because it was when we tried to

845
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,520
increase from 10 gigabits per second per

846
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,040
wavelength to 40 gigabits per second per

847
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,619
wavelength and I was around about

848
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,720
2002-ish uh the first time that we tried

849
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,140
it and when that was attempted we found

850
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,180
that polarization mode dispersion

851
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,300
suddenly became a problem at these very

852
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,540
high transmission rates and uh the

853
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,760
industry uh got their their heads

854
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,619
together and they created PMD

855
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,960
compensators and the problem with those

856
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,260
compensators is that you had to have one

857
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,200
per wavelength you had to have one for

858
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,060
each transponder they were usually

859
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,339
bigger than the transponder and they

860
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,160
cost more than the transponder so that

861
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,140
was why 40 gigabit per second

862
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,660
transmission didn't really take off in

863
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,880
the early 2000s because it required

864
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,220
these PMD compensators

865
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,980
imagine if that was like 80 wavelengths

866
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,200
which was very common in the early 2000s

867
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,880
uh that would have been hideously

868
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,920
expensive

869
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,119
now

870
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,700
there's also a set of uh effects that

871
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,880
are based on non-linear Behavior now

872
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,839
what's

873
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,160
the difference between linear and

874
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,320
non-linear a linear effect is something

875
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,240
like attenuation

876
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,060
because attenuation if you go twice as

877
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,579
far along the fiber your attenuation is

878
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:17,099
twice as bad well that's a linear uh

879
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,180
relationship

880
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,880
but there are non-linear effects that

881
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,460
literally do not happen at lower power

882
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,040
levels lower Optical power levels in the

883
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,859
fiber they only kick in if you try to

884
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,500
transmit at higher Optical power levels

885
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,200
and that's because glass is a non-linear

886
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,140
medium air is not by the way a wireless

887
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,640
transmission you don't have to worry

888
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,980
about that so those of you involved in

889
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,359
Wi-Fi

890
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,940
you can you know when you move to higher

891
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,520
Wi-Fi data rates you can just go to

892
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,540
higher modulation order like 1024 qualm

893
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,660
or 2048 one and the way that you deal

894
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,640
with the reduction in signal to noise

895
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
ratio is you turn up the power at the

896
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,859
transmitter well you can't do that in

897
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,859
Optical uh transmission uh not forever

898
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,300
anyway you can turn it up to a certain

899
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,859
point but then beyond that point you're

900
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,079
going to hit the non-linear effect and

901
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,000
these were discovered a long time ago

902
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,359
back in 1875 Scottish physicist or John

903
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,240
Kerr uh he uh

904
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,760
um discovered the Cur effect

905
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,339
now the curve effect if you look at the

906
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:25,260
Blue uh line

907
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,300
um above here

908
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,060
you can see that that's an that's a that

909
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,140
would be called a um an RZ Optical pulse

910
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,440
it's a Return To Zero Optical pulse

911
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,960
but the the front of the pulse the

912
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,420
optical power increases

913
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,640
uh very very quickly uh and it causes a

914
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,880
change in the refractive index of the

915
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,240
optical fiber if the optical power level

916
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,619
is high enough

917
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,440
and it's that change in in refractive

918
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,859
index that is the problem uh because the

919
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:03,920
end result is that you have

920
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,480
unfortunate effects like self-phase

921
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,119
modulation which is where an individual

922
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,859
wavelength of light if you're modulating

923
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:14,040
a too higher power level the modulation

924
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,380
symbols actually start to interfere with

925
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,119
themselves they start to you know

926
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,380
there's there's like an internal

927
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,540
crosstalk

928
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,520
cross-phase modulation is where

929
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,920
neighboring wavelengths interfere with

930
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,720
each other because they're spaced too

931
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,820
closely together and then there's this

932
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,579
weird Effect called four four wave

933
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,099
mixing which is where

934
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,200
um two wavelengths of sufficiently high

935
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,599
power level will actually create two

936
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,180
Phantom wavelengths uh and and those

937
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,220
Phantom wavelengths are equally spaced

938
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,339
wave frequencies so they they very often

939
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:50,220
will overlap neighboring wavelengths

940
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,560
um or neighboring frequencies uh in the

941
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,540
fiber so all of these effects are very

942
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,560
bad

943
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,339
now the traditional approach

944
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:02,460
to non-linear mitigation first of all

945
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,200
you control your Optical launch power

946
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,300
levels and also the optical power levels

947
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,300
in the amplifiers you can't

948
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,820
um turn up those power levels too high

949
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,400
you could also use optical fiber that

950
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,920
has a high chromatic dispersion like

951
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,520
good old g652 fiber and a high chromatic

952
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,820
dispersion the irony is it it spreads

953
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,300
out the uh the modulation pulses so the

954
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,760
power changes the optical power changes

955
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,099
are not too extreme

956
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,320
and you can also use optical fiber that

957
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,540
has a large effective area because now

958
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,520
you're spreading the power of the

959
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,400
modulation pulse over a larger area of

960
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,440
the glass so all of these things are

961
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,040
true by the way in g652 Fiber Well low

962
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,300
Optical launch power that's that's

963
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,160
decided by the uh by the network

964
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,380
operator but High chromatic dispersion

965
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,020
large effective area are properties of

966
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,700
g652

967
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,099
but we have new non-linear mitigation

968
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,300
techniques

969
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,940
um that that are a development of the

970
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,060
coherent transponder timeline Nyquist

971
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,579
subcarriers uh soft decision forward

972
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,040
error correction gain sharing super

973
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,380
glossy and PCs non-linear compensation

974
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,000
now these are all sort of technical

975
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,460
details of how a given implementation

976
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,240
would work but they all come about as a

977
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,040
result of the fact that we can now use

978
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,920
very powerful Digital Signal processing

979
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,000
in our transponders

980
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,660
and you

981
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,980
so imagine

982
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,500
there's a sort of uh there's a drive to

983
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,820
try to find the best optical fiber

984
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,160
and um what we saw in the in the early

985
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,099
80s uh the only wavelengths that we

986
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,260
could build were 13 10 nanometer lasers

987
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,720
not ideal for the attenuation that's in

988
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,300
the optical fiber but that's where we

989
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,800
put the zero chromatic dispersion

990
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,540
wavelength for g652 so uh g652 it's a

991
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,240
you know it's a it's an 80 Square Micron

992
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,460
effective area fiber

993
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,000
um with uh zero chromatic dispersion at

994
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,119
13 10 nanometers but unfortunately by

995
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,160
the time we get to the mid 80s where we

996
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,300
can build 15 50 nanometer lasers they

997
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,460
may be at the lowest attenuation of the

998
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,220
optical fiber but if you're using g652

999
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,740
you're now operating in a very high

1000
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,260
chromatic dispersion area now this is

1001
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,260
the the mid-80s we don't have coherent

1002
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,000
technology available because with

1003
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,099
coherent you could actually just correct

1004
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,140
for chromatic dispersion but this is

1005
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,760
when we need lots of dispersion

1006
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,640
compensating fiber in the net work now

1007
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,500
if you put a lot of DCF in the network

1008
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,839
you're actually reducing your Optical

1009
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,400
transmission budget and you're also

1010
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,619
adding a lot of latency because you need

1011
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,440
lots of this fiber that's really going

1012
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,300
nowhere it's just sitting as spools in

1013
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,200
the network

1014
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,599
so somebody said well why don't we build

1015
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,460
a different kind of fiber

1016
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,280
we can engineer the chromatic dispersion

1017
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,520
so that the zero dispersion point is at

1018
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,579
1550 nanometers and that's g653

1019
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:08,160
dispersion shifted fiber now I can't

1020
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,140
find a an effective area on g653

1021
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,819
g653 is the fiber that you know it's

1022
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:16,680
like the Halloween fiber it's horror

1023
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,940
fiber

1024
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,859
um it it's not the kind of fiber you

1025
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,839
want in your network

1026
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,099
um I'll tell you why in a moment but uh

1027
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:27,660
literally because of when the

1028
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,480
deployments were made you can find a lot

1029
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,780
of g653 in Italy in South America in

1030
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,260
Japan in some parts of the United States

1031
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,359
it's it's a minority because fortunately

1032
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,339
I don't think we deployed

1033
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:43,319
all that much of it before we kind of

1034
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:44,700
realized it was a bit of a problem

1035
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,680
because

1036
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,599
both of these fiber types were

1037
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:50,220
originally designed for single

1038
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,440
wavelength transmission

1039
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,280
so when dwdm came along in the mid 90s

1040
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,119
you've got uh g653 with very low

1041
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,180
dispersion and in order to operate with

1042
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,339
a high Optical power level like for

1043
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:07,319
example if you're using ad for

1044
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,480
amplifiers you end up with a high

1045
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,960
non-linear penalty and that that's why

1046
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,880
g653 it means you can't really get it

1047
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,700
all that much capacity in that fiber

1048
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,819
with dwdm

1049
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:23,400
so the answer is let's change the fiber

1050
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,180
again they came up with g655 non-zero

1051
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,760
dispersion shifted fiber and this is a

1052
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,380
little bit like Goldilocks if you think

1053
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,640
about it because at 15 50 nanometers

1054
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,460
g652 has too much chromatic dispersion

1055
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,839
but g653 really doesn't have enough but

1056
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:46,440
g655 was supposed to have just enough to

1057
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,240
allow you to have a lower non-linear

1058
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,099
penalty because of the chromatic

1059
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:53,099
dispersion but not so much chromatic

1060
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:55,560
dispersion that you need loads of DCF in

1061
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,579
your network

1062
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:59,280
but then people said yeah but in order

1063
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,420
to

1064
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,880
um engineer the what the the waveguide

1065
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,579
so that we have that dispersion we've

1066
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,579
now got a very small effective area

1067
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,119
52 Square microns which also has a an

1068
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,160
effect on the non-linear penalty

1069
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,680
so they they kind of went back to the

1070
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,180
drawing board and came up with something

1071
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,079
called g655 large effective area fiber

1072
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,339
or leaf uh this is a variant of g655

1073
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,520
what that means it still has a a a

1074
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,420
fairly low uh dispersion in the c-band

1075
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,579
um but it now has a larger effective

1076
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:39,240
area than G the original g655 it's 72

1077
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,400
square microns still not as much as the

1078
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,640
original g652 by the way but um

1079
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,900
but it is a a better fiber for single

1080
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,319
wavelength 10 gigabit transmission

1081
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,260
so is this just right is this a perfect

1082
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,339
fiber and really the answer is no

1083
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:02,760
because what happened uh from 2010

1084
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,819
onwards is we start to have coherent

1085
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:07,319
technology coming along

1086
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:10,200
and we now have five generations of

1087
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,599
coherent technology uh these are the

1088
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,599
dates of their commercial introduction

1089
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:16,859
uh and these are some of the

1090
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:20,160
characteristics of each generation so we

1091
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,920
see as we progress uh through the

1092
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,940
generations the modulation

1093
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,619
constellations become more complex from

1094
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,980
qpsk right through to 64 qualm and then

1095
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,540
we have

1096
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,079
um uh probabilistically shaped uh 64

1097
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,079
qualm in the latest generation we have

1098
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,420
increasing board rates these are the of

1099
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,980
the board rators the rate at which you

1100
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,859
send modulation symbols and on along the

1101
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:50,640
bottom you see the the drivers behind

1102
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,980
that it's the fact that we can have more

1103
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,800
and more advanced Asics uh for the

1104
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,300
optical engines in these coherent

1105
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,640
transmitters and the end result

1106
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,140
a higher data rate per wavelength and a

1107
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,740
greater capacity in the c-band for each

1108
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,200
of these generations and

1109
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,160
um

1110
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,780
the other thing that we can do of course

1111
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,859
with coherent is that we can completely

1112
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:19,500
compensate for chromatic dispersion so

1113
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,000
the irony is the best fiber for uh well

1114
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,780
the the best sort of widely used fiber

1115
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,119
for uh coherent transmission these days

1116
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,300
is good old g652 and if you happen to

1117
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,800
have uh smf-28 ultra low loss that's

1118
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,480
even better because it's a it's a very

1119
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,540
low loss version of g652

1120
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,579
um and it's funny the way that that sort

1121
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,260
of fiber technology has now come full

1122
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,480
circle because that was the original

1123
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,240
kind of fiber deployed

1124
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,260
and this is really all because

1125
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,720
uh semiconductor lasers are a superb

1126
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,579
source of light that scales to mass

1127
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:02,400
production and of course optical fiber

1128
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,619
is an amazingly inexpensive and

1129
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,960
efficient waveguide think about it we're

1130
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,680
basically making this stuff from Sand so

1131
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,319
um although you can get sort of uh

1132
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:16,380
supply chain shortages which I I think

1133
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,780
some people are experiencing

1134
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,680
experiencing at the moment with optical

1135
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,000
fiber

1136
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,520
um the base material is essentially uh

1137
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,560
very inexpensive

1138
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,319
so the reason that I'm so passionate

1139
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,200
about this particular topic is I

1140
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,700
originally qualified as a Plastics

1141
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,160
chemist I moved into telecommunications

1142
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,740
but you know it's funny I I still almost

1143
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,319
like a hobby I I I'm still interested in

1144
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,900
chemistry and I see these two

1145
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,839
technologies with completely unrelated

1146
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,839
chemistries and also the origins of them

1147
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,540
the the physical processes by which they

1148
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,300
work are different and yet they come

1149
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,660
together and work uh so well and you

1150
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,339
know the claim that has Optical

1151
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:01,319
networking really transformed our world

1152
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,380
I I think it has because there is no

1153
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,079
there is no alternative you know when we

1154
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,579
think about

1155
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,280
um uh that the scale of the internet the

1156
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,079
distances involved and the growing

1157
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,099
demand

1158
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:16,859
you all need this thing to keep going

1159
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,140
strong and you know could you do that

1160
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,180
without the kind of capacity that

1161
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,240
Optical networks uh give to you there

1162
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,859
really is no alternative I don't think

1163
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,020
there's an alternative in sight we can

1164
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,599
keep on pushing the boundaries

1165
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:32,460
um and and we you know in my previous

1166
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,859
talk actually I I talked about some of

1167
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:36,540
the alternative fiber types that we

1168
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,119
might use but you know in essence the

1169
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,480
the Baseline is still uh optical fiber

1170
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,880
and semiconductor lasers

1171
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,800
I hope that's been useful I hope you've

1172
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,020
been able to hear me okay and uh happy

1173
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,400
to answer any questions if we have time

1174
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,180
we do not appear to have any questions

1175
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,280
but thank you Jeff

1176
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,180
thank you very much

1177
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,469
