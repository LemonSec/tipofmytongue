1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
foreign

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,599
[Music]

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,320
my name is Edward McNair I'm the

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,139
executive director of nanog

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,420
um first of all question I have is how

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,920
many have been this room because I see a

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,960
lot of faces I recognize how many in

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,359
this room are actually newcomers raise

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,619
your hands

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,900
so your first time at a nanog being okay

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,340
everyone give them a round of applause

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,539
for the people are newcomers

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,719
so oddly enough we average that

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,600
approximately a third of our attendees

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,020
at each nanog meeting are newcomers and

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,300
so for the rest of you who are part of

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,640
the faithful part of the community I

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,920
want to make sure that you guys identify

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,739
a newcomer and that you hold on tight

20
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,539
and make sure that they want to come

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,340
back to another nanog again all right

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,620
can you guys promise me that

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,260
all right thank you so let me get

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,719
started for your newcomers here I want

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,800
to give you a little bit kind of

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,019
overview of the organization how it

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,060
works and so that you can get the most

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,840
of your experience from this nanog event

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,280
the program

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,180
so first of all what is nanoc we are a

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,060
Community Driven organization Our Roots

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,220
go back to

33
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,799
1987 when Merit networks was uh kind of

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,840
challenged with reimagining and

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,780
re-engineering the uh NSF net

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,479
our original charter as a as a as a kind

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,100
of a functioning organization with the

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,799
name nanog was in 1994. in 2011 the Nano

39
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,079
Community voted to separate themselves

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,860
from the Merit Network and form its own

41
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,939
organization so it could better serve

42
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,700
the community at Large

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,520
um nanog is the first and is still the

44
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,979
largest Network operators group

45
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,759
so what does nanog do well we we do

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,740
conferences that showcase the Innovative

47
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,079
educational content that aims to drive

48
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,299
solutions for the network operators

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,939
Community uh we Mentor the next

50
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,399
generation of network professionals and

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,919
we Empower those supporting internet

52
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,739
access and underserved regions across

53
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,260
North America we actively encourage

54
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,420
diversity inclusion and collaboration

55
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,940
within our community

56
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,680
so what does our community look like

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,700
well we have 13 000 plus industry

58
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,739
professionals that kind of make up nanoc

59
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,959
we have on average

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
um this is prior to the pandemic about a

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,860
thousand people that attend our

62
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,900
conferences this particular conference

63
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,640
is we're just looking north of 900

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,519
people who are attending this particular

65
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,580
conference we have on average 200 plus

66
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,220
newcomers or first-time attendees I

67
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,900
think that this meeting we're well in

68
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,640
the high two hundreds of people who have

69
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,220
never been to a nanog event before and

70
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,959
we represent people from 20 plus

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,800
countries from around the globe

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,959
so Network operators groups you know

73
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,780
what are they so what is a nog they're

74
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,120
Community organizations that are

75
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,459
committed to supporting their local and

76
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,500
Regional internet professionals they're

77
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,239
Guided by the principle of an open

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,940
exchange of information and expertise

79
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,159
they're formed by Network operators

80
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,440
engineers and other experts within the

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,420
internet Community they focus on

82
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,459
improving the quality and availability

83
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,159
of Internet within their particular

84
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,420
regions

85
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,060
so what's special about a knock well

86
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,099
first and foremost they are driven by

87
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,159
individuals and not by corporations

88
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,980
corporations do not exercise or push the

89
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,720
direction of nanog that's formed by

90
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,459
individuals within the community Through

91
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,400
educational technical presentations that

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,959
are available to all when this

93
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,480
conference is over all the talks that

94
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,459
are that are take place they'll be

95
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,500
sliced up and they'll be placed up on

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,019
YouTube for access in fact on our

97
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,659
YouTube channel we have over 19 000

98
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,659
subscribers to our YouTube channel and

99
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,860
we have over 2.4 million views so this

100
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,780
all this content that we're creating and

101
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,060
putting together is out available to the

102
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,620
public and you can share it with your

103
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,239
co-workers and Friends

104
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,540
so they're also local they focus on the

105
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,858
needs within their particular

106
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,079
communities and they're neutral we are

107
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,238
non-commercial and we are non-political

108
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,699
we are sponsored by corporations but

109
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,380
again corporations do not drive

110
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,080
direction of that on individuals do in

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,060
fact in being a member you can only be a

112
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,919
member as an individual and not as a

113
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,300
corporation

114
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,940
so how can you benefit from a nog you

115
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,860
can learn current best practices from

116
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,960
experienced industry professionals you

117
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,759
can obtain knowledge and training on the

118
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,580
latest industry Technologies discuss

119
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,979
current issues and challenges facing

120
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,440
within our particular Community the

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
conform strategic business relationships

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,460
even though we are an educational

123
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,280
non-profit nanog has been historically a

124
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,680
great environment to do business and we

125
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,259
try to help support that within our

126
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,880
members because some people come here

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,860
and Avila they don't even get to

128
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,120
actually sit in the conference room and

129
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,340
watch the presentations they'll catch

130
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,080
them later on YouTube they're here

131
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,340
because it creates a good business

132
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,680
climate as well and also there's an

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
opportunity to form critical peering

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,860
relationships we have a peering uh

135
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,960
what is it appearing Forum later on I

136
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,699
think it's today and you'll be able to

137
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,620
participate that if you wish

138
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,960

posting on there we currently have over

145
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,500
13 000 people who are subscribed to our

well we have an internet innovator

151
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,360
series which is a new thing that we're

152
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,060
pushing out in fact in this particular

153
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,639
event at five today of those who aren't

interested in going appearing we'll be

155
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,419
premiering a new video that'll come out

156
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,600
facing uh focusing on Nee coin or who is

157
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,860
considered to be the father of the

158
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,320
internet within the African continent we

159
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,780
have our Outreach initiatives and you

160
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,759
can find that in the pages for outreach

161
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,280
nanoc has large been kind of focused

162
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,979
within itself we're trying to expand and

163
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,080
our reach we're trying to go out and to

164
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,080
share I guess the good news about Nano

165
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,720
expanded spaces and our Outreach is a

166
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,759
part of those efforts and then you can

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,380
see articles and stories that we could

168
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,720
create that we produce about people in

169
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,460
our compute community and also latest

170
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,680
things happening within our community

171
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
so here's some facts you know some of

172
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,080
you may be newer to the industry

173
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,759
um and some we have some students which

174
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,120
here as well currently there's about 380

175
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,740
000 people employed in the field of

176
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,199
network operations

177
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,300
currently on indeed.com the last time I

178
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,819
looked there's about 30 000 plus job

179
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,240
openings that were available unfilled

180
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,360
and it will increase by about 19

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,940
000 plus each year and we compete with

182
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,000
an industry of over 700 000 open tech

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,860
jobs

184
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,620
so Nano governance

185
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,400
nanog is we have eight um

186
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,099
board of directors and they determine

187
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,800
the strategy and the direction of our

188
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,840
organization this is our current list of

189
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,819
board of directors as the executive

190
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,860
director I also serve on the board as

191
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,880
well

192
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,360
this is the nanox staff we have an

193
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,000
incredible team of eight people who do a

194
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,380
lot of work to make sure that you have

195
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,120
the best experiences possible these

196
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,039
conferences and also support our

197
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,979
Outreach efforts in addition provide and

198
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,960
create content and things that exist

199
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,199
Beyond just meetings themselves

200
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,919
so committees nanog has committees that

201
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,660
support our organization these

202
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,220
committees are staffed by Nana

203
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,020
volunteers

204
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,460
um I'll talk about being part of these

205
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,020
communities later on to be part of the

206
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,880
committee to become a member and I'd

207
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,440
always encourage you guys to become a

208
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,639
member and I'll talk about that a little

209
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,800
bit later we have our program committee

210
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,120
which is our standing committee

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,400
elections committee audit compensation

212
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,680
mentorship education scholarship and

213
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,240
Outreach

214
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,940
so getting involved in a broader scale

215
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,340
well the first thing to get involved to

216
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,960
be involved in nanog and to kind of

217
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,580
shift the direction of the organization

218
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,860
you need to become a member membership

219
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,860
is simple 100 a year and it is an

220
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,779
opportunity to not only support our

221
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,719
organization but also financially but

222
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,820
also to help shift the direction of

223
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,399
where nanog is going so the ways you can

224
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,500
get involved one by being a member is

225
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,260

expertise that you'd like to share with

239
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,120
the world that you think might form an

240
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,160
interesting course we'd be interested in

241
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
having you submit proposal for

242
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,300

of having Eddie Winstead teach a class

245
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,080

continue to thrive and grow was to

260
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,360
greatly appreciated

261
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,000
so our program committee

262
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,220
the nanoc program committee is at the

263
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,680
very heart of nanog our organization

264
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,040
I've said to my staff that if we had an

265
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,839
incredible program it could be held out

266
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,180
in an open field and people would attend

267
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,820
yes the the bacon is nice and all the

268
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,200
recruitments are wonderful but people

269
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,420
are here for the connection and for the

270
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,700
community and our program committee

271
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,800
again is at the heart of that it's made

272
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,019
up of Industry professionals which and

273
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,440
the PC is selected by the board once the

274
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,779
PC is selected it forms its own

275
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,080
governing structure the PC operates

276
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,760
independently from the board of

277
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,700
directors and it focuses on making sure

278
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,260
that the talks are of the highest

279
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,560
quality

280
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,660
so our program committee this is kind of

281
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,060
how the cycle of that program committee

282
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,240
and how it operates and functions

283
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,339
um we do a what they call a rolling call

284
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,920
for submissions so

285
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,860
um you can submit for nanog88 if you

286
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,120
want to

287
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,760
um the earlier submit the better the

288
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,560
opportunity of your talk getting through

289
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,920
the PC the focus for the PC is they want

290
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,100
to help you get your talks in and get

291
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,899
your presentations where they need to be

292
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,600
if you're new to the process submit

293
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,760
early your Shepherd will be assigned to

294
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,200
you and that Shepard will help you

295
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,540
curate your talk and to bring it to a

296
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,339
point where it is you know something

297
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,200
that's presentable to our community

298
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,240
so program committee updates to better

299
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,640
serve our community the PC is divided

300
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,160
into some sub categories keynote

301
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,779
speakers there's this cat there's a

302
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,820
group of a subcommittee that's focus on

303
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,399
making sure that we have great uh

304
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,200
keynote speakers for our events

305
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,079
lightning talks tutorials and tracks and

306
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,779
also the hackathon program we had a

307
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,700
hackathon that take took place this

308
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,620
weekend I kind of started a little

309
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,420
earlier last week but if you ever get a

310
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,060
chance to participate in our hackathon

311
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,079
you can do that and also you can

312
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,700
participate in the hackathon remotely

313
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,019
you don't have to actually be in the

314
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,180
physical nanog event to participate in

315
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,519
our hackathon

316
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,160
Outreach

317
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,600
so

318
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,220
um Outreach is one of those things which

319
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,399
is kind of dear to me I think that for

320
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,019
now log as an organization to continue

321
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,980
to thrive and grow you have to focus on

322
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,500
evangelism to some degree

323
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,540
um any organization that continues over

324
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,579
a long period of time has efforts that

325
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:36,779
are going out to assure that they're

326
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,760
bringing in fresh people that they're

327
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,160
expanding their organization and that's

328
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,980
kind of what Outreach is about this

329
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,260
focus is on supporting our educational

330
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,200
uh Mission we do Outreach to colleges

331
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,079
and universities we also can willing to

332
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,779
work with a local affiliate nogs and

333
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,519
we're also partnering up with other

334
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,860
organizations to be able to service the

335
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,480

industry professionals it's a great

365
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,639
opportunity for students to be exposed

366
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,160
to things beyond the theory that they

367
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,420
are experiencing the classroom

368
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,800

373
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,540
few years because of the pandemic and

374
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,519

have programs in place that support it
