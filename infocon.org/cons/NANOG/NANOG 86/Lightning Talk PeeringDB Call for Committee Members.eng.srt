10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,199
hi everybody I'm Patrick this is ticker

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,720
uh this is going to be kind of short

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,140
um I work or I volunteer sorry I don't

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,640
have a mic on my shirt so I have to

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,859
stand in front of this thing uh I

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,780
volunteer for the pairing to be and I

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,340
don't do enough work so I'm hoping that

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,800
some of you can help us out

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,559
um appearingdb is uh run by volunteers I

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,660
think everybody here knows that

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,520
um we need support from the community or

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,379
the parent D would appearing DB would

22
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,059
not exist and of course that would be a

23
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,640
very very bad thing so we need uh some

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,079
volunteers for some committees and we're

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,420
hoping that you or somebody you know can

26
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,680
help us out

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,079
the first is the admin committee uh

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,160
these are the people that answer the

29
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,300
tickets

30
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,559
um

31
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,860
uh what we would like is to obviously

32
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,360
try to automate ourselves out of a job

33
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,680
but we're not doing a very good job of

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
automating ourselves out of a job

35
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,460
um so we need people to answer the

36
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,860
tickets but even when we get better

37
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,600
automation there's always going to be

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,400
tickets that need to be touched by a

39
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,460
human so if you can help us out with

40
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,900
this we'd appreciate it we especially

41
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,640
need people who speak things other than

42
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,200
English

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,759
um anybody who volunteers should speak

44
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,020
English just because that's what the

45
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,140
rest of us speak you know sorry but uh

46
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,880
if you speak a second language we'd

47
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,320
appreciate it

48
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,619

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,780
they're looking for anybody not just

52
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,340
Network operators so if you for instance

53
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,659
have a marketing background this might

54
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,820
be a good committee for you if you have

55
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,040
time and it's interesting please reach

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,360
out

57
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,759
uh the operations committee uh these are

58
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,140
the people that run the infrastructure

59
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,899

62
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,939
uh the committee is very small but it's

63
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,619
very highly trusted as you can imagine

64
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,139
having root on these systems is not

65
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,038
something we want to give out

66
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,099
willy-nilly so uh if you would like to

67
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,900
help out with that please volunteer just

68
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,280
realize that it is a small committee

69
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,840

70
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,180
