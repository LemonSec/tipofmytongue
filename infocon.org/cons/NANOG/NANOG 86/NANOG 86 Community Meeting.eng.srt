11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,140
yeah I mean I we are all very very

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,000
fortunate you know over the course of

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,679
the pandemic it's had a kind of a

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,280
dramatic effect on our world as a whole

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,440
as our communities and also our

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,960
individual community at nanog this is

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,520
the first meeting since we've been back

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,960
that it really feels like kind of a

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,120
traditional nanog meeting so I'm excited

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,460
to be here when the board made the

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,100
decision unanimously to cold meetings

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,899
coming out of the offset of the pandemic

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,420
it was just been the slow March as we

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,480
move forward and I really appreciate our

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,860
sponsors and our community who've

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,920
rallied behind to help continue nanog

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,319
the good things that we do and also this

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,760
to bring us all kind of back in

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,799
community again so I'm really really

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,200
excited to be here so this morning I'm

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,280
going to take a few minutes just to

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,900
assess a few things

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,060
first thing I want to talk about is our

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,740
development updates

35
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,939
so we're fortunate to have Greg Newman

36
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,600
join us as a full-time employee Greg has

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,820
been helping us in the past three years

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,920
working for a third party for our

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,740
development efforts Greg coming on board

40
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,840
as a full-time staff member has just

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,900
been an amazing experience every once in

42
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,340
a while you get really lucky when you

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,759
find an employee Greg is that rare

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,640
individual as a as a programmer who kind

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
of straddles both sides of the fence

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,659
mentally on one side you've got this

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,640
analytical programmer and on the other

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,700
side he's actually a fine artist and his

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,380
ability to communicate with the team has

50
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,600
just been incredible when he came on

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,420
board as a full-time employee he was

52
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,000
instrumental into putting off a project

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,899
for reimagining our program tools which

54
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,520
cat will talk about a little bit later

55
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,679
but having him been on as a full-time

56
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,480
employee has just been a gift to the

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,180
organization and we're lucky to have him

58
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,800
so across uh 20 uh 22 here's the

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,360
development projects we've kind of

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,580
tackled we've migrated membership and

61
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,980
donations to stripe we've improved our

62
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,180
test coverage

63
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,800
um in terms of our application how it

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,959
functions we have new forms we've

65
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,660
created for talk submissions we did a

66
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,700
cluster rebuild of our website we

67
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,459
upgraded from stripe as a payment option

68
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,319
moving away from

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,660
um Authority authorize.net which we used

70
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,540
in the past we've been able to deliver

71
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,940
the appointment tool something you guys

72
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,500
been asking for a long time which has

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,060
been in beta which I'm going to go

74
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,400
through in just a moment we've done

75
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,680
dozens of bugs business and as I

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,680
mentioned earlier the PC2 PC tool

77
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,200
version 2.0 which cat will talk about in

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,239
a little bit so I'm going to take a

79
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,280
little bit and kind of talk about our

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,180
new

81
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,160
um appointment tool this is again

82
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,540
something the community's been asking

83
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,519
for a while we kind of had to have a

84
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,040
stage approach so we build first our

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,980
reimagining our registration system

86
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,420
reimagining our event system which

87
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,120
allowed us to move into creating our own

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,700
internal tool for uh connecting with

89
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,739
other people while you're at events so

90
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,300
the first thing that had to happen is

91
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,220
when you register is got to ask you a

92
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,840
question well do you want to be

93
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,120
available for appointments having our

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,860
own tool allowed it's a lot more control

95
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,620
over that once you specify yes I want to

96
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,540
make myself available you'll see that

97
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,519
there's an indication that appears here

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,980
where it says Hey the calendar icon says

99
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,140
I'm available for appointments so

100
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,959
clicking on that would then bring you to

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,480
a pop-up in that pop-up you're able to

102
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,060
put in the details of meeting with that

103
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,340
individual and then they are sent

104
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,220
communication where in their inbox well

105
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,080
first of all they're sending email and

106
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,640
then in their inbox they'll tell them

107
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,680
you have X amount of invites you're

108
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,980
outgoing or in another town and it has a

109
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,260
drag and drop interface operates pretty

110
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,700
much well like any other calendar that

111
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,739
you used to allows you to move around

112
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,560
and update your uh your entries here

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,060
once you're in where you can see the

114
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,040
invitations that you sent or invitations

115
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,260
that you received you can click on those

116
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,540
items and then you can see a detail of

117
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,699
the communication you can chat back and

118
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,860
forth between people the invites are

119
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,060
until you can kind of get things

120
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,000
scheduled the way you want them to be

121
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,639
and then finally when you're actually in

122
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,199
the tool itself you're coming from the

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,479
calendar view in my calendar you're able

124
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,340
to move things around manipulate them

125
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,400
just as you would in any other typical

126
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,500
calendar tool

127
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,680
so for 2023 what we're looking to do in

128
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
development is update our websites

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,419
navigation UI and also the back end

130
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,060
Administration tools for staff when we

131
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,400
originally built our website we didn't

132
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,259
keep in mind all the things that's now

133
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,240
become so at this point in time we need

134
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,759
to kind of do a refresh of the UI and

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,320
just little things just so a little more

136
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,300
cohesiveness into how the site functions

137
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,699
and operates we're going to do updates

138
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,860
to our registration system we're going

139
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,139
to have a sponsor tool right now a lot

140
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,520
of the sponsor work that we've done is

141
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,320
by hand and it's kind of time consuming

142
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,880
we're going to give an automated tool

143
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,259
that's going to smooth out that process

144
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,660
saving staff time and making sure that

145
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,820
our sponsors are getting the kind of

146
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,580
love and attention that they deserve

147
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,720
we're going to release the appointment

148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,240
tool in version one so if any of you

149
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,580
have any comments on that if you look

150
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,320
inside of that tool there's a link that

151
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,180
takes you to our discourse site and

152
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,800
there's a forum that goes on where you

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,419
can kind of give your feedback about the

154
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,460
tool and how it's working we're going to

155
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,259
do updates to our virtual Platform One

156
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,880
Thing in particular that people have

157
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,520
asked about is the ability to directly

158
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,340
communicate with a person is just just

159
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,840
communicating in mass and that will take

160
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,600
place next year as well for our meeting

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
uh for our appointment tool we're going

162
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,520
to have the ability to schedule based on

163
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,800
um places in the room tables or meeting

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,600
areas Etc will be kind of built into

165
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,580
that as well we're going to do an

166
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,080
interactive reporting tool something

167
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,940
that will benefit ourselves internally

168
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,220
and also there'll be some reflected that

169
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,660
you'll see back and some of the tools

170
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,460
that you'll be able to access as part of

171
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,800
the community and then the final thing

172
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,360
that we're going to do is we're going to

173
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
uh

174
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,139
do the final steps in enabling other

175
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,060
knobs or other organizations to use

176
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,759
nanox tools we put a substantial

177
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,139
investment in these tools and we think

178
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,460
it's something that we can be shared

179
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,039
with our community abroad other knobs

180
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,720
across the globe and also within North

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,940
America and so we're kind of looking at

182
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,740
if anyone is looking to help support us

183
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,000
in that initiative we'd greatly

184
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,220
appreciate it we think it's a good cause

185
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,960
and if we can get any support in there

186
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,900
we'd greatly appreciate it

187
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,580
so now I want to talk a little about

188
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,960
some of the Outreach things we've done

189
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,440
over the past few months so we have an

190
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,780
Outreach group that helps kind of stage

191
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,660
and help us kind of expand nanoc Beyond

192
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,520
just these typical conferences that we

193
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,780
do

194
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,340
um we have we did a collaborative

195
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,620
project with our Outreach Partners we're

196
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,520
nanog icann Aaron and also isoc

197
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,199
participates in those in this particular

198
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,720
one isoc wasn't able to join us but we

199
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,880
were invited by the mayor's office to

200
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,340
come and to present

201
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,740
um a kind of a forum geared at students

202
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,560
within their Community here is the list

203
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,300
of topics that we covered during that

204
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,639
event it was a great event we had a

205
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,960
really wonderful time we even got kind

206
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,460
of little coverage on the news which was

207
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,160
kind of nice but again it's part of how

208
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,319
we're trying to expand our reach we're

209
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,759
trying to kind of encourage the next

210
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,319
generation of people to join and

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,180
participate in Nano

212
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,120
that said I'll turn over to cat for the

213
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,900
rest of the presentation

214
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,300
hello again

215
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,120
so the PC has gone through some

216
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
Evolution over the last year or so

217
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
um we've added some additional

218
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,180
subcommittees one which is especially

219
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,979
fun and nerdy is our data analysis

220
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,080
subcommittee which I see Liz right there

221
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,580
waveless

222
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,139
um Liz pretty much single-handedly

223
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,340
started that

224
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,740
um and when you see people coming up

225
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,720
here on stage and and we're introducing

226
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,160
them and we're saying oh and so and so

227
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,080
has been to nanog five times and their

228
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,639
first synagogue was this number and all

229
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,199
those fun stats

230
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,639
um are because of this data analysis

231
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,080
subcommittee we've been able to really

232
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,660
work on yeah ingesting all that

233
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,879
information making it usable

234
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,979
um and it's it's a really

235
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,479
awesome and fun thing to be able to tell

236
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,179
you guys all those amazing stats uh we

237
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,740
also recently started a moderator

238
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,240
subcommittee

239
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,339
um which again when we come up here we

240
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,839
have to moderate some people have never

241
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,520
done public speaking in our program

242
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,740
committee team and it's very daunting if

243
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,940
you've never been up on a stage of

244
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,500
course right so our modern subcommittee

245
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,459
is to help ease them through that

246
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,279
process they also help work on these

247
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,480
lovely

248
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,760
moderator speeches that we curate now so

249
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,200
it's no longer ad hoc the last couple

250
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,339
years

251
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,440
it's been fantastic

252
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,300
yeah so those are two great new

253
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,680
subcommittees that we started as a

254
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,080
branch out in the PC to just make the PC

255
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,240
run smoother for all of you

256
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,100
um and then on the other hand we also

257
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,920
took some socomies we had in the PC and

258
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,240
then the board broke them off into

259
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,100
completely separate subcommittees so

260
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,480
they're no longer under

261
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,620
um the BC anymore that would be the

262
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,779
education and Outreach so those used to

263
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,339
be your PC member and then you served on

264
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,620
the subcomm ages now they are their own

265
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,660
manual committees you don't have to be a

266
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,100
PC member to serve on education or

267
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,839
Outreach

268
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,519
um and then we've done a lot of

269
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,660
improvements to the talk submission

270
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,180
process and one of the biggest ones of

271
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,399
those is a signing content of yours

272
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,720
earlier in the process when I first

273
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,240
joined the PC the secretary was in

274
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,580
charge of making sure that the content

275
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,620
reviewing committee would help and look

276
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,360
at your slides if you got accepted make

277
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,620
sure you had fonts that were actually

278
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,600
readable from out there and you weren't

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,920
squinting and that there wasn't these

280
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,420
crazy big logos of vendors on every

281
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,300
single slide and all that stuff and we

282
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,620
now assign an individual content

283
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,720
reviewer alongside your Shepherd so your

284
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
shepherd's that person that reaches out

285
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,420
and says thank you for submitting let me

286
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,920
work through these slides with you your

287
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,420
content appears that second person that

288
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,440
helps you go through and just make sure

289
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
that your copy editor right so just

290
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,440
making sure it's actually readable

291
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,300
presentable and follows the analog

292
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,040
standards and we did that early on in

293
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,120
the process too whether or not you're

294
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,380
accepted or not we'll still help you

295
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,279
make sure it's a good looking

296
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,140
presentation regardless so you're not

297
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,339
scrambling at the last minute when you

298
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,180
finally do get accepted

299
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,399
um so oops I overlapped that by accident

300
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,800
but uh they asked Edward was talking

301
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,779
about with Greg's work he has done a

302
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,140
phenomenal job overhauling our PC tool

303
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,420
um this is our our talk list view now

304
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,820
the old one was very

305
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,920
lots of white space and looked like it

306
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,959
was from the 90s and this is a much

307
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,700
easier to work with PC tool for those of

308
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,920
us now reviewing your talks for obvious

309
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,480
reasons I filtered to accept it because

310
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,880
I didn't want to Colony non-accepted

311
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,980
talks out but if you see that there's

312
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,779
that red and that yellow and the green

313
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,760
and the the gray looking ones in that

314
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,860
top right corner there we can quickly

315
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,300
filter and just look at the ones

316
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,519
appending for us means you've submitted

317
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,959
but we haven't started voting on it yet

318
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,519
for consideration so those are the talks

319
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,540
when we're still working with you and

320
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,279
helping you improve it making sure it's

321
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,920
got slides attached submitted is once

322
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,420
once you actually have your slides and

323
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,560
you think it's ready for the PC to

324
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,600
review and consider for the for the talk

325
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,040
and then obviously accept it into

326
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,459
further the other statuses but yeah this

327
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,399
tool just made our job so much easier

328
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,480
and yes you can see we had a lot of

329
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,000
talks for nanog 86.

330
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,140
um

331
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,880
the other really amazing thing that we

332
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,100
got for this most recent cycle that Greg

333
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,620
developed was the agenda Builder so we

334
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,779
used to take this Excel spreadsheet and

335
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,399
then we would write on the side all the

336
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,200
accepted talks and how long they were

337
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,959
and what their title number was and then

338
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,880
we would sit there and copy and paste

339
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,019
and then we had to move it was really

340
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,360
annoying to unmerge the cells you know

341
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,839
and it was yeah it took a while we now

342
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,820
um using the same um stuff you guys used

343
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,519
for the appointment Builder uh meeting

344
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,079
um appointments can use that for our

345
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,480
agenda Builder and so you know it knows

346
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,860
exactly how long the talk is already so

347
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,200
I just drag it over the right amount is

348
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,839
on there and so we were in record time

349
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,060
building the agenda this time it was

350
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,160
very nice and so much easier

351
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,899
so it's been great having Greg on staff

352
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,760
because he's just done a lot of stuff to

353
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,560
make all the behind the scenes stuff and

354
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,320
then I'll work really well

355
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,180
let's see next

356
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,500
reminder

357
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,060
um you know for the last uh several

358
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,320
years now we've been doing a rolling

359
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,420
call for presentations right so you

360
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,980
currently in the tool can submit up

361
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,839
through uh 89.

362
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,940
so um you do not have to only be

363
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,220
submitting 487 now

364
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,959
um example last standoff when we were in

365
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,100
Montreal

366
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,720
there was a lovely idea for nanog

367
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,980
Jeopardy that someone wanted to submit

368
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,940
but they weren't going to be available

369
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,980
to come here for Hollywood they had

370
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,779
another plan for that week they

371
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,639
submitted for 87 it's been in the tool

372
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,160
since last nanog for us to work on and

373
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,959
help him review and improve the idea for

374
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,940
right so you guys can submit talks

375
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,139
really early and we can help you out

376
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,079
with those and if if it's ready to be

377
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,459
considered even if it's two or three

378
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,440
nanogs out we can even accept it two or

379
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
three nanogs early for that talk if it's

380
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,040
it meets that criteria that we normally

381
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,660
would accept any other talk because the

382
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,620
talk is either good enough to be

383
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,240
accepted or it's not it shouldn't matter

384
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,160
whether that nanog is the next one or

385
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,320
two or three later right if something is

386
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,959
a good caliber for our our conference we

387
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,600
won't accept that now

388
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,399
um but yeah so when you submit right um

389
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,380
we receive your proposals we assign you

390
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,700
that Shepard and content Reviewer is

391
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,740
talking about you have to have slides

392
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,420
for us to review it they don't have to

393
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,860
be like in their Perfect final groom

394
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,899
state but they do have to have some meet

395
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,240
to them we do the peer reviews

396
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,500
um and then if you are accepted that's

397
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,760
when your final slides will be due

398
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,260
before the conference

399
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,700
um and then we are able to publish that

400
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,200
agenda nice and quickly using the agenda

401
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,120
Builder now you send your final sites

402
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,800
out before the conference and we're all

403
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,540
here now for conference begins

404
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,339
so to some stats around our submission

405
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,399
so far um on 86 I know it's at 103 on

406
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,260
the other slide of the screenshot but

407
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,339
that's because I don't have all the

408
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,019
nanog general content in there so like

409
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,060
the lunches are all blocked off the

410
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,860
breakfasts are all blocked off the

411
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,480
meeting breaks are all blocked off so

412
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,940
that 103 is not actually the number of

413
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,560
talks we received we actually received

414
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,019
73 actual talks now accounting all the

415
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,700
the filler stuff that you saw on that

416
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,320
other screenshot

417
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,760
um and we were able to accept 24 of

418
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,440
those plus two lightning talks one

419
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,839
yesterday and one tonight

420
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,100
um and you're probably wondering well

421
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,139
where do those other 50 talks go like

422
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,579
what happened right

423
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:24,720
um 10 of those when I looked at them

424
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,860
they had decided to withdraw for

425
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,420
whatever reason so maybe they were going

426
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,620
to be able to come and then they they

427
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,700
couldn't or they didn't feel like they

428
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,959
were ready to finish their slides in

429
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,000
time for consideration that happens

430
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,800
pretty regularly with our presenters

431
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,720
right we all have day jobs and sometimes

432
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,279
they get busier

433
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,380
um you can oh see that we have 12

434
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,019
pending talks in 87 probably at least 10

435
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,820
of those I believe are ones that got

436
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,680
deferred from 86 so those numbers are

437
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,300
actually kind of duplicated right

438
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,800
they're they're in 86 so they were

439
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,000
considered but then they asked to push

440
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,040
them over to to 87 and that's something

441
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,600
we can do very easily for you if you

442
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,100
submit we have a little button that'll

443
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,560
just clone a talk so if you say hey I

444
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,760
can't make it or I don't have enough

445
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,800
time to really spruce up my slides and

446
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,060
get it ready for this Nano could you

447
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,459
just push it out we can and likewise if

448
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,320
we felt the agenda too early and then

449
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,579
your talk comes in and we're like hey

450
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:09,839
this looks really good we just don't

451
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,699
have space for it would you like us to

452
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,500
clone it over a lot of people will say

453
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,699
yes and we'll just clone it over to the

454
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,260
next one for consideration there and

455
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,820
then you've got some more time to have

456
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,740
us look at it

457
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,300
um one big thing though right this past

458
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,620
year we didn't have a tutorials and

459
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,720
tracks room due to budget cuts we will

460
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,279
have that room back for all of the next

461
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,440
three conferences so we should accept

462
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,320
much more than 24 talks next time and a

463
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,399
lot of you guys are missing tutorials

464
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,680
especially they will be back so please

465
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,180
submit tutorials we would love to have

466
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,519
everything from like bgp 101 to Advanced

467
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,500
tutorials right we love having all of

468
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,639
those and we're really excited to have

469
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,380
them back so hopefully we'll be in the

470
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,060
30 plus number of talks accepted to fill

471
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,860
those

472
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,260
and submit as early as you can um we had

473
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,699
a lot of people that waited till the

474
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,380
deadline and we already had many other

475
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,880
talks already in voting status at that

476
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,279
point so um you know the earlier you can

477
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,600
get in the earlier you can be accepted

478
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,860
and your better your chances are if you

479
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,360
wait till the deadline you know yes

480
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,440
we'll still look at if it comes in on

481
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,820
the deadline but we can't guarantee that

482
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,139
there'll still be space if we've had a

483
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,339
lot of other really good talks come in

484
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,940

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,980
serve two consecutive two-year terms

497
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,480
before you have to take a mandatory

498
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,000
break there will be 14 positions

499
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,279
available for this next cycle of which

500
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,959
five of those will be term limited PC

501
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,279
members who are not eligible to be

502
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,079
reappointed so at least for sure five

503
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,000
spots will be open possibly a few more

504
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,079
because usually some people have day

505
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,639
jobs that get busier and will choose not

506
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,500
to to rerun

507
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,940
um but yes please put your name and if

508
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,440
you have any interest and if you're

509
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,759
curious about the responsibilities

510

they're both on our website and any of

511
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,880
the program committee members such as

512
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,740

513
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,839

516
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,579
you about what it means to be on the PC

517
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,020
and and how much of a time commitment

518
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,939
that is and what all you'll be doing

519
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:09,959
um and then we'll make the appointments

520
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,500
in February

521
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,959
and that's all I had uh we'd like to

522
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,000
open the Florida questions you know

523
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,220
Louie has one

524
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,380
actually I have two uh Louis Lee Google

525
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,120
Fiber I'll stand up for the first time

526
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,040
you go

527
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,679
all right um first thought thank you so

528
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,020
much for the um for the talk

529
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,140
um just got me thinking during the

530
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,780
presentation uh for the tutorials

531
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,380
um

532
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,240
do you think maybe you want to do a

533
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,059
series of soft skills

534
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,460
um maybe one of the modules could be how

535
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,299
to give

536
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,590
a technical presentation

537
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,539
[Laughter]

538
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,419
you know for various audiences like in a

539
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,460
room this size or to your Senior

540
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,520
Management in order to highlight what

541
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,880
you've done or what you want to do kind

542
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,140
of projects uh deploy IPv6 for instance

543
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,340
um but

544
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,220
you know this is part of our career

545
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,299
building

546
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,840
right and as brilliant as many of us are

547
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,720
all of us are actually yeah

548
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,179
the soft skills are very important in

549
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:27,539
order to get a team together to to build

550
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,740
things to make things happen so I would

551
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,600
suggest that soft skills are very

552
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,620
important as a nano tutorial track yeah

553
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,600
we would love to do them please submit

554
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,539
them yeah and I'm not sure that I would

555
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,280
be appropriate to be teaching something

556
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,640
like that but how you know um I'm sure

557
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,100
that uh folks are engaged with the

558
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,500
groups that are great at doing stuff

559
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,240
like that like for instance if you're

560
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,880
ever engaged in Toastmasters or maybe

561
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,039
find a local Toastmasters person that's

562
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,720
willing to do a half an afternoon

563
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,660
tutorial for several people you know

564
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,299
even bring their most recent talk and

565
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,000
and or or an upcoming presentation that

566
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,320
kind of thing

567
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,179
um so uh that is just one idea I'd love

568
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,980
to I know in the past we've had

569
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,500
Christina who did a public speaking kind

570
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,600
of tutorials and I actually just bumped

571
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,400
into her yesterday and asked her if she

572
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,320
was interested in continuing that I

573
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,940
agree with you I think soft skills are

574
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,799
very important we even kind of bounce

575
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,720
that around a little bit in our the

576
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,820
education committee so hopefully out

577
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,659
here comes Christina

578
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,220
hello

579
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,220
um I'm Christina true entity

580
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,200
um I want to respond to that you

581
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,600
mentioned about Toastmaster and I looked

582
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,480
into it

583
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,280
we couldn't have Toastmaster here

584
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,980
because of certain

585
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,440
um policy guidelines Toastmaster have

586
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,860
and that's why I formed it what I formed

587
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,080
it before that's the public speaking

588
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,760
forum

589
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,740
um we can talk about it you know how

590
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,520
this can continue on or evolve oh things

591
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,960
like that

592
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,419
um but what you mentioned about a moment

593
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,980
ago about

594
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,580
um

595
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,160
having someone teaching this what you

596
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,020
call soft skill and I would call it

597
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,880
professional skills that will Embrace

598
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,620
more stuff

599
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,740
um actually when it's I served on the PC

600
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,860
we talk about professional development

601
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,679
track that kind of thing and at that

602
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,740
time it was Betty Betty he emphasized

603
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,740
that you know if there's a need we could

604
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,059
hire someone to give that kind of um

605
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,480
Talk That kind of tutorial or whatnot so

606
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm sure you know it will probably still

607
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,539
an option when program committees see it

608
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,460
um that is something that we want to do

609
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,220
so may not necessarily be you know we

610
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,660
see the need doesn't necessarily mean

611
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,700
that we have the skill set to teach

612
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,740
someone right so we couldn't submit the

613
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,020
talk but I think there's got to be a

614
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,960
this just like what you have done with

615
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,559
your feedback to you know the

616
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,120
executive director and they will take

617
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,799
and the program committee they can take

618
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,840
it and you know so when they think that

619
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,880
time is right and they can hire someone

620
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,299
and come and give it to the community

621
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,280
thank you Christina

622
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,120
thanks Louie

623
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,780
no it's not okay go ahead

624
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,340
but please no no okay okay

625
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,539
um the the other thing is I wanted to uh

626
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:42,120
if we can just have a moment on

627
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,780
um

628
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,059
quite literally is to uh how we're

629
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:50,760
approaching the memorializing of folks

630
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,820
in our community that have passed say

631
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,559
within the last year

632
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,120
I understand that there have been

633
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,559
thoughts about doing a memorial page so

634
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,020
that anybody can submit

635
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,600
um it actually exists yeah so we

636
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,340
actually uh highlighted this last nanak

637
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,360
and I guess we should have reviewed it

638
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,919
for this one so I do apologize for not

639
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,659
throwing a slide in there if you go to

640
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,760
community.nana.org

641
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,080
um last night because we had a couple

642
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,820
people that passed um that everyone had

643
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,460
sent in notes about we started a page on

644
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,380
the discourse which is

645
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,159
community.netic.org and I think it's all

646
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,440
at the bottom it says a memoriam and you

647
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,820
can there's a form there that you can

648
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,500
actually submit if someone's name is not

649
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,059
on there that you would like us to have

650
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,679
added to the site and then it's because

651
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
it's Forum right the idea is that people

652
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,460
can just add comments and memories on

653
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,620
there um and so we shared ones from the

654
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,240
people that had passed last time I added

655
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,380
a name

656
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,480
um Vijay gill who had passed um that

657
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,740
that name was added before this nanox

658
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,059
started when I got the information about

659
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,679
him as well

660
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:47,940
um but yeah if we don't add it on our

661
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,260
own for you because we heard about it

662
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,700
there is a form that you can submit on

663
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,919
the nanog website the link is also

664
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,620
findable on that immemorium page header

665
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,659
so please add that we can share photos

666
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,400
you can share stories memories

667
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,780
everything

668
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,880
um it gets tricky to always put them in

669
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,020
the presentations and opening and

670
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,100
closing because we have very limited

671
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,659
time for opening and closing right so

672
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:07,740
that's why we want to have this like

673
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,260
living page where we can just add a

674
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,240
thread for every person that passes so

675
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,980
if they were important to you whether

676
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,940
they're big or small in the community

677
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,120
please submit their name you know

678
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,360
thank you for that um

679
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,860
we're in Hollywood

680
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,980
um I actually thought that it might be

681
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,140
nice to do something like what the

682
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,580
Oscars do just run through the names and

683
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,260
it doesn't have any names that you guys

684
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,179
pick because you already have names from

685
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,600
that memorial page so if their names had

686
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,020
appeared within since the last time

687
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,419
um we had a meeting or sorry if we do

688
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,820
this only once a year then maybe since

689
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,340
last October

690
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,980
um then just either scroll through

691
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,280
quickly or have it up for a minute in

692
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,940
the background or maybe during a Break

693
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,179
um just so that uh it gets just a little

694
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:07,020
more attention than off to the website

695
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,500
okay thank you thank you thank you

696
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,360
Tina

697
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,220
um mine is just uh oh I'm sorry Tina

698
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,059
Morris AWS also nanog board uh just one

699
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,260
housekeeping thing on the meeting

700
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,480
planning tool I've gotten a lot of

701
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,120
feedback for features and I know we have

702
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,220
a submission form and it'd be good to

703
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,620
publish the backlog because the features

704
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,080
I've sent to Greg already are already in

705
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,940
his Pipeline and I think we could really

706
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,299
reduce that and help people curate the

707
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,740
development of that tool better yeah

708
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,600
we're going to be Greg's in the process

709
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,400
of publishing all that so it's feasible

710
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,059
for all to see it actually syncs up with

711
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,799
um if you go onto our website I can't

712
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,419
remember exactly where the place is but

713
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,400
and I'll make sure it's it's put out

714
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,679
there so everyone we can see that what

715
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:53,940
tracks what we're doing in the

716
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,440
development why so it is there I just

717
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,580
got to make sure it's in a prominent

718
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,080
space and remind people of where it is

719
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,500
yeah great thank you thank you Tina

720
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,419
you have a virtual question yeah I've

721
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,860
got a call I've got a question that came

722
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,940
in on the chat from Matt pett Tech

723
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,020
um and on your slides you basically had

724
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,600
about the badge printing yes you

725
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,000
mentioned it oh I am so sorry about that

726
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,039
yes we're going to be run through that

727
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,780
question yes badge printing will be

728
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,919
coming back

729
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,620
um hopefully in our June meeting we're

730
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,179
going to be returning back to having a

731
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,799
badge printing service it'll slow down

732
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,120
the cues

733
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,919
um it's going to have an iPad interface

734
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,659
to it you'll just be able to go up there

735
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,120
and just say login quick it'll print out

736
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,440
your badge you'll assemble it and you'll

737
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,580
go on your way so when we had

738
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,860
implemented in the past the community

739
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,419
really liked it a lot because it speeded

740
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,460
up the registration process

741
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,159
do you know I just wanted to add to that

742
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,720
um I think this goes without saying but

743
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,700
the badge printing like we did before is

744
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,059
a bigger badge correct oh yes so the

745
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,220
names and the affiliation will be much

746
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,659
easier to read yes it will be yes yes

747
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:03,020
they will be

748
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,120
any other questions from the community

749
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,799
at all

750
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,960
any questions about volunteering for now

751
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,720
either while we're here

752
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,860

a small crew internally there's eight of

757
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,799
us plus the board and the volunteers are

758
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,539
crucial to being able to put on these

759
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,580
meetings and the programs that we do so

760
