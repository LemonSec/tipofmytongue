Paul Dixie

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,080
yay

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,340
Paul is presenting going dark

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,080
catastrophic security and privacy losses

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,180
due to the loss of visibility by managed

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,619
private Networks

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,099
Paul first took the nanog stage in 1994.

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,340
since they spoken 25 times most recently

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,860
as a keynote in 2019. was it really that

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,239
long ago

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,059
wow that was in San Francisco

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,620
uh currently vpde at AWS security polis

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,600
founded co-founded authored or

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,280
co-authored many of the industry

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,100
practices views today Paul is also a

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,899
well-known collector of 10 millimeter

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,340
wrenches

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,399
you can explain that and uh likes to

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,840
drive a standard

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,899
Mr vixi we're sorry Dr Dixie

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,340
thank you very much you're welcome

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,720
hello good morning

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,700
um

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,799
I'm really fascinated by some of the

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,020
things Harlan just exposed I met him

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,780
through the ntp project and it turns out

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,540
a lot of the pile of patches that Dr

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,540
Mills asked him to apply were from me

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,600
um so that's kind of cool

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,619
um

34
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,220
so today uh gonna talk a little bit

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,159
about quick Q UIC a little bit about DNS

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,680
over https

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,100
um and this is kind of more of an edge

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,740
problem or an edge opportunity it's an

39
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,619
edge topic rather than a core topic and

40
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,840
I realize a lot of you are just sort of

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,759
in the packet business and don't

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,799
necessarily care where they're coming

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,299
from or where they're going or whether

44
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,220
they're good or evil

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,579
um but I do and even if you don't in

46
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,200
your day job you probably do at your

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,399
house so uh you know please

48
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,860
be be willing to consider some security

49
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,440
implications because not all packets are

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,180
morally equal

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,280
um

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,360
so I do want to say I although I am

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,340
wearing the shirt and I am an Amazon

54
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,120
employee uh they did not send me here to

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,700
do this uh as far as I know none of this

56
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,739
would be considered controversial by

57
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,959
anybody at Amazon but they're definitely

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,340
My Views

59
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,819
um so please keep that in mind as you go

60
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:36,959
through this

61
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,040
there is really no effective modern site

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,920
security

63
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,519
and get into the reasons for that but

64
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,260
that is sort of something that's got to

65
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,019
be understood as you contemplate what's

66
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,900
going on in the standards World

67
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,580
um so uh we don't

68
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,280
use there's no useful way to look for

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,300
patterns and say oh look it's uh this

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,099
particular bit pattern is part of a

71
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,080
known botnet or is part of a known

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,640
signature

73
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,120
um because everything is encrypted now

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,760
um so we don't have the ability to say

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,620
these patterns are bad and we're going

76
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,959
to stop them what we do instead is we

77
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,140
look at what the endpoints are doing

78
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,739
and we try to build a model A Norm of

79
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,980
some kind and

80
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,540
when they fall outside that Norm when

81
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,819
they go outside that Norm then you you

82
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,980
say hey that's an anomaly and I don't

83
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,019
know why it could be just a new new

84
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,299
version of the software but let's go

85
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,599
take a look at it and this is lame this

86
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,260
is not what one would think of if you uh

87
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,900
sort of were building this on an empty

88
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,000
whiteboard and and trying to sort of

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,920
figure out how you really wanted it to

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,140
work in order to maximize safety

91
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,239
minimize costs

92
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,239
um but it's what we have and uh we are

93
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,180
roughly speaking forced to it

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,140
um and alternatives are way more

95
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,540
expensive so

96
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,200
um

97
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,540
I want to remind us all that it's a

98
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,940
global internet and we are we now have

99
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,858
an attack surface that includes every

100
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,000
powered device in the world and even if

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,180
certain physical Assets in the world are

102
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,680
you know they're physical dude they

103
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,160
aren't really network uh accessible as

104
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,680
physical objects but they the record of

105
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,960
their ownership and the ability to

106
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,419
control them or monitor them absolutely

107
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,580
is and so

108
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,880
um everything of value in the world is

109
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,699
connected and we don't have a way to

110
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,040
secure it and

111
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,660
um if you read the headlines and you're

112
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,120
wondering how did it get so bad that's

113
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,500
it

114
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,479
um yeah so

115
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,320
again don't panic this is stuff you

116
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,060
already know

117
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,580
um but you're gonna keep this in mind

118
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,740
again while you evaluate what's

119
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,060
happening in the standards committee

120
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,320
right or Community right now

121
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,580
so there are really no experts anymore

122
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,840
um and you know I come from a time when

123
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,139
a small number of people small number of

124
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,020
big expensive mini computers it was

125
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,759
generally possible to know what was

126
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,100
going on and to keep track of the

127
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,560
research that affected what was going on

128
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,919
you know I remember uh early days of

129
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,440
bsds somebody discovered hey if you send

130
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,259
a Christmas tree packet a TCP sin with

131
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,080
all the option bits set you can crash

132
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,560
any BSD kernel that you can reach

133
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,080
um but you know we there were so few of

134
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,440
us and so few BSD computers that it was

135
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,020
fixed in a week uh we're not going to do

136
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,759
that anymore not just because there are

137
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,180
too many things to patch but uh because

138
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,180
the vendors are don't exist anymore for

139
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,220
a lot of our stuff

140
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,500
um if they do it's very possible that

141
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,900
our particular product from us from some

142
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,780
vendor is no longer reproducible they

143
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,120
don't necessarily have the build system

144
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,940
that it would take to patch a thing so

145
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,680
that they can send you an update and it

146
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,240
may be that they don't know who you are

147
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,580
and can't send you the update

148
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,280
um there's a whole lot of reasons that

149
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,180
um you it's just too big there's no way

150
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,000
to be an expert relative to the size of

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,479
what we must maintain and operate and

152
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,880
and secure

153
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,020
um

154
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,660
and you know what that in turn means is

155
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,960
that if you have some estimate of your

156
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,000
safety you're wondering how bad is it

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
how exposed am I

158
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,860
uh that is a wave function at this point

159
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,860
all you have is probability uh you don't

160
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,900
have certainty and that puts a

161
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,759
confidence interval around every

162
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,220
statement of confidence that we have in

163
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,860
our current safety

164
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,919
um again this is lame this is not how

165
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,900
you would build this if you had a choice

166
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,580
what we

167
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,880
had was not a choice but rather a series

168
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,160
of choices stretching back about 30

169
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,120
years and each thing that we did was the

170
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,580
next thing that could be done and in

171
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,440
many cases the best that could be done

172
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,400
at that time and uh by now we have gone

173
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,919
a long way down a trail and we can only

174
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,039
go forward

175
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,160
so you know backups you know whenever

176
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,860
somebody reports that they have had to

177
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,139
pay a ransom to get their data back or

178
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,020
get the decryption key you know backups

179
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,699
is my first question did you have

180
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,520
backups and you know backups is a

181
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,180
reasonable strategy if you are

182
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,240
um talking about your own laptop but

183
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,720
when it's let's say Sony and North Korea

184
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,139
has done the bad thing it's difficult to

185
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,240
imagine how Sony could have had backups

186
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,960
for everything that they lost

187
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,319
and the same would be true of pretty

188
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,000
much everything else that you have to do

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,180
is it's too expensive to do well right

190
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,180
the reason that uh Cloud companies like

191
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,300
the shirt here uh do well is that they

192
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,400
can afford to make the necessary

193
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,740
Investments to do these things well

194
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,799
and uh everybody else not everybody but

195
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,599
a lot of other companies would rather

196
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,659
sort of buy into a mature supply chain

197
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,240
that solves these problems well than to

198
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,959
have to hire usually difficult people uh

199
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,440
the to come and create and operate all

200
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,160
of that infrastructure locally

201
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,800
and again that's why Splunk does well in

202
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,680
the logging Market that's why all the

203
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,959
various security companies do so well is

204
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,480
because they are doing things that need

205
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,360
to be done in a way that the end users

206
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,360
cannot afford to do for themselves again

207
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,600
this is maybe not as lame as the other

208
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,380
examples I've given but it is not what

209
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,240
you would think of if you know if any of

210
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
these companies had a chance to choose

211
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,540
their operating environment they

212
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,700
probably wouldn't have chosen to need as

213
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,980
many outside suppliers as everyone now

214
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,080
needs

215
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,660
and you know sadly the outside suppliers

216
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,660
become a single point of failure for

217
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,320
many either because they sometimes your

218
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,779
supply chain gets breached sometimes

219
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,580
your supply chain you know has an

220
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,820
earthquake or something like that so

221
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,200
external dependencies are things you

222
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
would like to have a choice about and

223
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,820
you don't in this in these cases

224
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,260
and finally the way that site security

225
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,140
became so ineffective is just it comes

226
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,920
down to the incentives an attacker will

227
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,600
make money if they win and a Defender

228
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,060
will spend money whether they win or

229
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,220
whether they lose so if it's a profit

230
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,899
Center for one side of the equation then

231
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,240
a cost center for the other then you can

232
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,519
begin to understand why the attackers

233
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,060
are so good

234
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,019
and you know let me just hope that what

235
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,500
I've done is paint a picture of

236
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,660
um very expensive very dangerous

237
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,000
operating conditions for the world's

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,240
assets all of which are either connected

239
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,220
to the internet or are controlled by

240
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,500
things that are connected by the to the

241
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,620
internet

242
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,720
so in 2013 a contractor

243
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,839
uh famously flew to Hong Kong and made

244
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,519
some disclosures and said by the way

245
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,620
this is what the US government has been

246
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,060
up to

247
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,560
um you know did you know there was a

248
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,500
secret lab where a router could be

249
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,800
redirected out of the federal express

250
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,440
shipping lanes and uh have chips added

251
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,600
to it on its way to some destination

252
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,660
that the U.S government wanted to be

253
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,360
able to surveil that would be one of

254
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,579
many disclosures it was a big deal it

255
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,660
was like the big the story of 2013.

256
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,880
and um

257
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,540
you know it's no secret that governments

258
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,160
not just the U.S government but

259
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,500
governments through history

260
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,600
um use dirty tricks

261
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,260
um and the idea of you know whether it's

262
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,740
right or wrong is fun to argue about if

263
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,779
you have a beer in your hand but the

264
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,339
people who are doing it are not going to

265
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,660
have those arguments it's all about

266
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,440
power and it's all about Duty and uh

267
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,500
doing whatever it is that you those

268
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,140
folks think is their Duty

269
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,800
um so I was part of a group of people

270
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,720
who was not especially shocked by these

271
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,279
disclosures yeah some of the details

272
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,680
were eyebrow raising but the idea that

273
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,079
yeah the US government is uh is

274
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,899
committing dirty tricks yeah that's

275
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,120
that's what governments do but a lot of

276
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,680
other people

277
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,019
um got out got up they set their hair on

278
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,760
fire they said you know oh my goodness

279
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
this is a terrible State of Affairs

280
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,480
governments should not be able to act

281
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,380
this way and um after some years of

282
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,260
debate we got a couple of rfcs

283
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,459
uh 7258 simply explained to the

284
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,740
standards community that pervasive

285
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,579
monitoring is an attack and uh that all

286
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,339
of the technology that we will build in

287
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,200
the future has to be resistant to that

288
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,100
attack

289
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,060
uh later uh something that I consider

290
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,620
even more controversial is that 8890

291
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,880
said that the internet is for end users

292
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,920
now you can perform the same test I did

293
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,839
you know check the back of your skull

294
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,360
check all over your entire head and see

295
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,820
if you have a CAT5 Jack because if you

296
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,380
don't

297
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,200
um the internet is not for end users the

298
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,360
internet is for the makers of the

299
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,500
devices that the end users are using

300
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,279
um so this thing is a

301
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,339
dangerous statement because what we're

302
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:27,000
saying is give away your control to

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,579
corporate persons

304
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:32,339
and the internet is for them and that

305
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,560
indeed is what you're seeing I am a

306
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,720
member of The Advisory board at the

307
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,839
Electronic Privacy Information Center

308
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,639
epic.org

309
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,399
and the chairman of the fiduciary board

310
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,820
is the incoming is shoshana zhukov who

311
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,560
wrote a great book I recommended it's

312
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,639
the age of surveillance capitalism

313
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,240
and so I am very worried about a lot of

314
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,800
different things and some of my worries

315
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,600
conflict with others of my worries right

316
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,680
if if children are being hurt online

317
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,040
sexual predation grooming whatever

318
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,880
um

319
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,600
we'd like to be able to protect them but

320
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,260
we need to do that without

321
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,360
annihilating privacy so we have to find

322
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,279
a way to both have and not have privacy

323
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,620
simultaneously that's a very interesting

324
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,480
problem

325
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,339
these are not interesting solutions to

326
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,620
that problem these are single-minded

327
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,620
cartoonish attempts to pretend that

328
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,779
problem is not important

329
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,839
so not a fan

330
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,000
in particular the

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,180
the idea of pervasive monitoring being

332
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,399
an attack

333
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,139
means that if you have a firewall and

334
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,820
you'd like to inspect the traffic coming

335
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,339
in and out of your Edge Network you are

336
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,620
part of the problem according to RFC

337
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,500
7258

338
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,060
endpoints should be allowed to speak to

339
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,339
other endpoints and nobody in the middle

340
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,560
should be able to see what's going on or

341
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,000
decide whether it's safe or not

342
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,480
and indeed the the ietf is taking this

343
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,000
seriously if you want to debate it

344
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,940
you'll find that there is no room for

345
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,519
debate at this point the debate was had

346
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,740
and it was had in light of everybody

347
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,579
setting their hair on fire in 2013 so I

348
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,820
think there will be a backlash against

349
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,519
this at some point but right now we're

350
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,079
going there

351
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:34,980
um

352
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,420
and you know I want to note that uh the

353
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,899
way we're doing this now is that malware

354
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,199
has rights because if you know software

355
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,899
the the maker of your device did not

356
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,060
intend to include but their supply chain

357
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,380
was poisoned uh or if it's just

358
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,680
vulnerable and uh some malware gets into

359
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,420
it because it tries to do some internet

360
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,980
thing and then there's this extra

361
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,980
payload or buffer overrun or whatever

362
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,880
you can end up with a device on your

363
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,860
network and you know fairly often this

364
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,740
will be a iot refrigerator or something

365
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,699
like that that is under the control of

366
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:20,100
not you the homeowner and not whoever it

367
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,899
is that sold it to you but some other

368
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,339
party which could easily be some

369
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,220
government which means that we did not

370
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,079
solve the problem that was described in

371
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:37,740
2013. this is chilling and it's

372
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,839
happening in plain sight and we're even

373
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,320
paying for the devices that do this

374
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,060
um

375
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,940
so because the internet is for end users

376
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,360
malware qualifies as an end user uh go

377
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,660
us

378
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,860
now the internet uh again as I said

379
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,259
earlier was not planned we didn't have

380
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,740
an empty white board and uh say yeah we

381
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,900
want a global e-commerce platform that

382
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,079
to which everything will be connected

383
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,500
um I'm sure that was uh in in mind as a

384
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,240
lovely outcome because the alternative

385
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,939
was the OSI protocol Suite

386
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:18,559
um

387
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,599
but really all the Whiteboard is going

388
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,520
to contain is a solution to the problems

389
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,020
that you have at that moment or the

390
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,000
opportunities that you're seeking at

391
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,620
that moment

392
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,640
um and that sort of incrementalism is

393
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,360
quite chaotic uh quite unpredictable

394
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,320
um and you know the the only truly good

395
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,760
thing about it is that there's no other

396
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,039
way we could have an internet than to do

397
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,280
it that way if we had known how much had

398
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,440
to be built back in the days when

399
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,140
transistors cost a dollar a piece we

400
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,640
would have given up and said that what

401
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,039
we want to do can't be done instead you

402
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,600
know we built the routers we could build

403
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,020
and we had class full addressing and you

404
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,840
know flat text files for naming and you

405
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,780
know we gradually improved each thing

406
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,220
within the context of everything else

407
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,280
that by then existed and um yeah that

408
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,600
was the only way we could have got here

409
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,000
so uh chaos is uh Harsh Mistress you got

410
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
to have it I mean you got to live with

411
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,600
it but what this in turn meant was that

412
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,200
a lot of the protocols that we depend on

413
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,419
don't account for things like firewalls

414
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:30,919
or network address translation or

415
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,940
any other sort of reasonable security

416
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,740
policy enforcement right the protocols

417
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,500
just do what they do and it was up to us

418
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,919
to find a way to kind of deal with the

419
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,020
Simplicity of the system without

420
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,900
violating any of the uh the the

421
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,799
assumptions that made it work at all

422
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,860
um and I think that was great yeah I

423
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,840
mean it's kind of ugly nobody would

424
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,880
would have designed Nat into this in the

425
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,080
first place but the fact that it was

426
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,380
able to be added was a huge validation

427
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,260
of the approach that had been taken for

428
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,660
IP and TCP in the first place so again

429
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,500
go us

430
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,460
but um we do have a bit of a mess and

431
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,080
this feeds back into the fact that

432
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,160
nobody can there isn't expertise uh some

433
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,200
of us know a lot about a few things some

434
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,000
of us know a little about about a lot of

435
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,980
things nobody knows everything and

436
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,900
nobody knows and we do not collectively

437
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,299
know enough the complexity of that which

438
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,100
we are trying to understand

439
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,760
is growing uh and you know you could

440
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,620
even think of it as like the expanding

441
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,740
Universe right the we are lucky to see

442
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,660
uh galaxies in the sky but they're

443
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,760
receding at more than the speed of light

444
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,520
and so a billion years from now our Sky

445
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,220
will be dark because the universe is

446
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,080
expanding well think of this as that

447
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,600
same thing the universe of our technical

448
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,080
operating conditions is expanding and

449
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,000
it's doing that exponentially

450
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,200
so to secure any of this uh as I

451
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,520
mentioned you got to find a way to uh

452
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,160
impose yourself on what's happening in a

453
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,320
way that breaks only the things you

454
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,480
intend to break right if you say I'm

455
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,400
gonna be secure because I have these

456
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,679
wire cutters that will not be a popular

457
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,760
move and it'll put you out of business

458
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,679
but if you can say well I'm going to

459
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,400
block traffic that I know to be bad

460
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,440
and then allow the rest I mean that's

461
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,020
dangerous but it's practical you can do

462
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,320
it you could do the opposite you could

463
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,480
say I'm going to allow the traffic that

464
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,900
I know to be good and to neither rest

465
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,080
and that is less dangerous but also sort

466
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
of higher cost alternative because it'll

467
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,460
mean that you know some new protocol

468
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,640
will come along like sctp and because

469
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,360
nothing new to allow it its default

470
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,460
denying you can't actually deploy it

471
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,679
outside of very very specialized

472
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,900
networks

473
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,160
so the thing that you can't do

474
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,280
in this new world

475
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,320
is any of that you can't decide what to

476
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,520
allow or deny because you don't know

477
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,160
what it is and this is not just for

478
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,679
operating system kernels and uh who

479
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,539
space firewalls it's also the site

480
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,000
Security administrator or an

481
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,860
authoritarian government

482
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,380
um there are if you travel in certain

483
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,940
parts of the world you'll find that you

484
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,559
can't reach certain parts of the

485
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,700
internet and that's because the

486
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,500
government wants it that way and that's

487
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,820
because they can tell where you're

488
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,860
trying to go and if they don't want you

489
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,659
to go there they don't want anybody in

490
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,760
the country to go there then they can

491
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,559
insist

492
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,080
um now if you are one of the people who

493
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,620
set your hair on fire in 2013 and you

494
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,679
are a legitimate passionate defender of

495
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,600
human Freedom

496
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,820
um you're going to look at this and say

497
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,840
the whatever comes next can't be more of

498
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,620
this we we need to sort of flip the flip

499
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,840
the game we need to flip the board and

500
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,600
get a very different set of operating

501
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,720
conditions and that in turn means

502
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,360
encrypt everything

503
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,520
um now in the interest of time I'm not

504
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,460
going to tell you very much about uh

505
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,600
entropy but I do want to say information

506
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,299
entropy is a little different from heat

507
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,120
entropy and it has to do with the ratio

508
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,299
of uh microstates that could have

509
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,480
produced a macrostate and you know if

510
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,039
you if there are more of them then you

511
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,280
have the higher entropy and the idea of

512
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,220
all of this encryption is by God

513
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,440
encrypted so hard that it is

514
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,299
indistinguishable from anything else

515
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,460
that you have encrypted

516
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,760
um and we have the ability to do that uh

517
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,299
now there's some arguments about how we

518
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,159
do this in a Quantum Computing World

519
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,400
which all of us know is coming so a lot

520
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,400
of the current crypto that we have will

521
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,360
be weak in

522
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,179
15 years and there are people working on

523
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,580
post Quantum crypto right now so that we

524
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,559
can start using it so that by the time

525
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,720
we have quantum computers the crypto

526
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,299
will be strong enough for them that's

527
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,340
one of the great games that I'm glad to

528
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,460
see played because we do need crypto

529
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,580
so here's an RFC 8484

530
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,380
that describes a protocol DNS over https

531
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,419
that uh you know I'm just I I

532
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,299
highlighted one passage here which is

533
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,000
that the goal of this protocol is to

534
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,280
prevent on path devices from interfering

535
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,220
with DNS operations well guess what

536
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,260
that's what corporate firewalls do

537
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,320
that's what uh parental filtering does

538
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,240
that is how people who own managed

539
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,940
private networks decide to protect

540
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,840
against certain kinds of attacks

541
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,400
since they own the network it's a little

542
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,200
odd to me that we now have a standard

543
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,299
that says yeah it doesn't matter what

544
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:15,659
you own the endpoint has ultimate power

545
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,419
period

546
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:21,960
and that's happening this is becoming

547
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,220
widely practiced and you know to be fair

548
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,260
there are things that a managed private

549
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,880
Network wants to do that um

550
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,440
maybe public networks should not do

551
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,260
right this whole thing about uh I want

552
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,419
to maybe protect my children against

553
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,059
online predation by monitoring them or

554
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,100
by preventing them from getting to

555
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,720
certain websites

556
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,640
um you know I'm a parent I own the

557
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,980
computer it's my child it's my house I

558
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,260
pay for the internet connection I should

559
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,960
be able to do that but if it's an ISP

560
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,600
who wants to monitor my children or the

561
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,880
local government wants to monitor my

562
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,539
children then I think they are trying to

563
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,520
command something that is not theirs to

564
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,940
command and so there are legitimate

565
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,640
times when you should forbid that on

566
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,640
path interference uh it but there are

567
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,679
times that you shouldn't and that is not

568
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,120
allowed for by any of these

569
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,380
specifications

570
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,020
so now we have quick quick is coming

571
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,779
right at you it is RFC 9000 9001 9002

572
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,500
um it is uh pretty decent bit of

573
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,380
engineering a lot of work went into it

574
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,820
um but this passage uh causes me some

575
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,260
heartache

576
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,600
um partly because it's misleading right

577
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,580
because what it should have said is the

578
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,980
quick wire image is specifically

579
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,679
designed to be indistinguishable from

580
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,539
other UDP traffic because that's the

581
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,140
truth it was written in light of RFC

582
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,080
8890 and that's what it's said to do and

583
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,000
that's what we are doing and that's why

584
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,580
we're doing it but I tried to get this

585
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,380
changed and I couldn't I got some other

586
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,900
language added around it but uh nobody

587
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,760
wants to come right out and say that we

588
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,020
intend this traffic to be

589
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,360
indistinguishable even though

590
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,100
um

591
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,320
they they very much do

592
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,220
um so what does this mean uh it means

593
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,140
you're not going to see any of this

594
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,059
anymore so if you have a load balancer

595
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,279
that is counting on understanding the

596
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,840
window scale so it can figure out what

597
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,000
to do with the flow sorry that's all

598
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,360
encrypted in the quick world if you have

599
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,340
a firewall that says I wish to allow

600
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,919
outbound TCP sessions from this Edge

601
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:38,779
network

602
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:41,340
but not inbound you're not going to be

603
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,380
able to do that either because there is

604
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,260
no sin or act bit that the router or the

605
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,080
firewall can can witness the only the

606
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,240
endpoints know why this packet was

607
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,100
transmitted

608
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,380
and if you're thinking you might be able

609
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,659
to do this with flow accounting and say

610
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,880
that the first time this four two five

611
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,340
Tuple tries to talk to that five Tuple

612
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,020
then I can look at the directionality of

613
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,440
that packet no you can't because the uh

614
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,140
the session could be long suspended it

615
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,900
could go hours without uh communicating

616
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,640
and then be reused by either side and so

617
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,100
you can't really you just can't do the

618
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,260
types of policy that we have all been

619
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,659
doing for our Edge networks all these

620
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,240
years and we are not the targets of this

621
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,740
I want to say unless you are an

622
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,960
authoritarian government

623
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,559
um you are not the uh the reason that

624
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,220
this this protocol exists or is being

625
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,580
made or is about to be widely deployed

626
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,039
we are simply collateral damage in the

627
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,980
fight against uh governments doing what

628
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,640
governments do

629
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,100
let's talk a moment about transport

630
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,700
layer security this is the name of the

631
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,460
crypto Suite that we use for pretty much

632
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,440
everything

633
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,279
SSL is uh kind of dead and and none too

634
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,740
soon TLS 1.2 is very broadly adopted

635
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,000
it's just about everywhere and it has a

636
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,980
property that may have been accidental

637
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,140
it may be that nobody did this

638
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,200
deliberately but when it was done nobody

639
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,779
thought it was a problem

640
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:28,740
but the the the the name of the server

641
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,159
that you want to talk to on the far end

642
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:33,600
uh is in clear text

643
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,620
and so if you have a next-gen firewall

644
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,140
that is sort of being the man in the

645
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,240
middle for some TCP session and

646
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,980
pretending to be the other end long

647
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,320
enough that you'll tell it what the host

648
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,360
name is that you want the other end to

649
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,480
to act as then

650
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,960
um that all works and so those of us who

651
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,600
have you know big corporate networks to

652
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,059
protect maybe we've got Regulators maybe

653
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,400
we've got

654
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,799
regulatory requirements

655
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:07,020
policy imposed by government as to what

656
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,740
traffic we must allow or must deny that

657
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,860
works you can do that

658
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,179
but that's a problem right the reason

659
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,179
this even exists is because the far end

660
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:21,000
uh it may have may be a CDN of some kind

661
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,980
it may have millions or tens of millions

662
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,039
of different websites it could behave as

663
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,840
all with the same three or four IP

664
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,600
addresses that are TCP any casted and so

665
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,539
forth right that shows the the amazing

666
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,880
in sort of agility of the original

667
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,779
design to be able to sort of permit all

668
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,600
of this to just kind of come about and

669
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,340
it didn't come about naturally a lot of

670
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,840
people had to think very hard to get

671
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,899
this but we got it but

672
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,059
um the idea is you have to tell the

673
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,220
other end what host it should be so that

674
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,320
it will know what certificate to present

675
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,720
you with

676
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,360
seems like a no-brainer

677
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,899
TLS 1.3 has an option called encrypted

678
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:05,539
client hello

679
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:08,340
where once you've got your initial

680
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,740
encryption set up that is and only that

681
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,899
will allow you to send this client hello

682
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,059
information that includes the server

683
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,520
name so this used to be called encrypted

684
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,460
Sni server name indicator but it got

685
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,740
broadened to encrypting encrypting the

686
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,779
entire client Hello message

687
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:28,200
so any of our corporate firewalls that

688
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,480
depend on you know let's say it's the

689
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,960
law in your country that uh people be

690
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,740
able to reach their child's school or

691
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,260
their bank or you know other critical

692
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,480
infrastructure for families from the

693
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,760
work Network

694
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,679
um and so you might have had an allow

695
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,080
list that said these are the banks and

696
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,000
schools and things that that have to be

697
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,600
reachable from our employee desktops

698
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,059
um you can't do that anymore so the law

699
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,100
commands you to do it but the protocol

700
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,220
Now commands that you don't

701
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,100
um that would be an example of the cure

702
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,179
being a a disease of its own it's you

703
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,279
know we're we're deciding whenever you

704
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,919
innovate you're saying uh I want

705
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,779
different problems I want different

706
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,640
opportunities I want to deal with

707
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,500
problems and opportunities that I have

708
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
so that I will have better ones and in

709
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,179
this case I don't think it's a better

710
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:25,799
one I think we have swapped the problem

711
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,720
we had for a problem we're going to

712
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,320
dislike equally if not more

713
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,059
so uh this is going to be a huge deal

714
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,580
and what we're going to do about it is

715
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,039
going to depend on our other costs

716
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,299
so you could say look

717
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:45,899
um

718
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:49,020
the ocean is so large and my boat is so

719
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,600
small I just have to let this happen I

720
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,000
just have to you know go to the new

721
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,580
place and live in the new way and just

722
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,100
deal with those costs so not good but

723
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,100
many organizations many homes will just

724
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,919
they have to do this they don't have any

725
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,080
other choice those of us who do have

726
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,059
other choices are going to do things

727
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,659
that are very expensive

728
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:17,279
for example since I know that quick

729
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,220
relies on UDP I'm glad that I have

730
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,500
always treated UDP as a dangerous

731
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,659
protocol and I have only allowed listed

732
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:27,720
certain UDP patterns in particular if

733
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,399
you want to reach a DNS server it better

734
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,980
be the one on on our Network

735
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,500
or you had better be that DNS server

736
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,520
trying to do some kind of

737
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,980
server-to-server traffic off net and

738
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,659
other than that UDP falls on the floor

739
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,659
which means quick simply won't work at

740
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,700
my house and that's a choice I can

741
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,460
afford to make but I'm uh and probably

742
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,080
most of you in this room could afford to

743
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,779
make that choice but we are what would

744
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,700
be called one percenters in that regard

745
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,820
most of the world won't be doing that

746
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,159
um something else we might do in

747
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:00,659
particular in the example I gave you

748
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,960
about if your nation's laws require that

749
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,460
your employees be able to use the

750
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,960
corporate Network to reach their Bank

751
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,840
during their lunch hour or whatever

752
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,480
you may have to say

753
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,279
I'm not going to allow end-to-end

754
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,200
connectivity even though that's better

755
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,720
for any number of reasons I can't afford

756
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,460
to do it anymore the risks are too great

757
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,419
so I'm going to put a proxy there an ALG

758
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,620
and you're going to have to configure

759
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,159
your device to talk to and Trust some

760
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:33,179
kind of proxy and uh the it you will

761
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,059
exchange certificate information with it

762
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:39,600
it will look at everything you intend to

763
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,899
do in clear text and regenerate your

764
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:44,940
session toward the outside right there

765
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,740
are plenty of networks that already work

766
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,039
this way but the problem is in some

767
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,019
countries you're not allowed to then

768
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,940
look at the banking traffic that you're

769
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,980
required to permit so it's going to be

770
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,440
very interesting to see how we solve the

771
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,159
uh the the PCI issues that are going to

772
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,600
come about from all of this because

773
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,980
you're damned if you do and you're

774
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,200
damned if you don't

775
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,260
um go us so

776
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,820
um these are expensive choices and

777
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,320
they're being imposed for political

778
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,179
reasons

779
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,859
um they're also uh Unstoppable I'm I am

780
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,980
not telling you what might happen I'm

781
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,659
telling you what is inevitable what's

782
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,820
already in progress is that there is

783
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,300
considerable energy uh powering this

784
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,780
this change

785
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,859
um

786
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:40,560
in addition to sort of the PCI problems

787
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,199
it's also just uh the bad engineering

788
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,300
right we don't like State inside of our

789
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,219
networks and it's okay if it's

790
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,179
opportunistic right if you're uh FIB has

791
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,460
to periodically fetch something from the

792
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,260
rib because a new flow is starting up

793
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,760
and the line card doesn't know what to

794
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,740
do with it that's state but it's

795
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,359
opportunistic right if you didn't have

796
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,520
it everything would just go slow but it

797
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,320
would still work

798
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,359
um we're not talking about that we're

799
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,480
talking about state that must exist in

800
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,480
order to fulfill the policy objectives

801
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,780
of edge Network owners secure private

802
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,579
networks that you're supposed to have

803
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,200
autonomy over

804
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,000
so

805
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,720
um

806
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,000
in addition to the problem of calling

807
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,380
somebody and saying would you please

808
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,240
stop ddosing me and the person you call

809
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,240
says I have no idea which one of my

810
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,339
hosts is ddosing you or what they're

811
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,500
infected with I have no Insight at all

812
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,079
into what's going on on my network or

813
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,500
the devices on my network so you're just

814
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,880
going to get what you get

815
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,220
that's a big change because it used to

816
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,900
be we called them autonomous systems

817
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,820
because of the the there was somebody

818
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,619
who owned something they were

819
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,500
responsible for what it did and they

820
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,960
could make choices uh and they were

821
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,540
responsible for those choices that era

822
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,780
is ending but the other problem is we're

823
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,420
going to have these uh sort of weird

824
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,060
devices at the edges of networks that

825
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,760
keep track of the state of every

826
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,859
transaction that goes through it and

827
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:16,940
that's additional heat that's additional

828
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,320
cost complexity bugs vulnerabilities

829
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,619
hashing Cycles performance it's going to

830
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,440
be a general drag and you know when I

831
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,079
when I talk to people who are passionate

832
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,300
Defenders of human Freedom whose hair

833
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,119
has been on fire since 2013. you know

834
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,520
they they will some I've been told to my

835
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,579
face Paul the 1990s called they want

836
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,920
your firewall back

837
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,000
um no they didn't because

838
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,619
uh if I have an iot baby monitor pointed

839
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:56,280
at the crib but it's got a vulnerability

840
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,740
and it is all of a sudden participating

841
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,099
in a botnet that I've got to know I I

842
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,079
have to know that it is now behaving

843
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,140
anomalously that means I have to have a

844
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,700
firewall I have to monitor the traffic

845
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,160
and I have to be able to control it so

846
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,579
it's this is not a 1990s thing that I

847
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,680
happen to have kept with me all these

848
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,799
years

849
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,560
um

850
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,460
but anyway the uh the people who see the

851
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,000
reaction too quick and Doh are either

852
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,400
going to say that it's bad Humanity or

853
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,560
bad engineering and that for one or both

854
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,380
of those reasons we ought not do it

855
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,000
um again I'm not telling you what might

856
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,619
happen I'm just these are the

857
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,119
inevitabilities that have been set in

858
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,480
motion

859
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,440
now

860
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,520
um

861
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:50,339
let me say uh when transport which has

862
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:53,720
meant TCP for a lot of us

863
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,220
when transport needed to be modified

864
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,599
there were system calls when some server

865
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,540
or client running in user mode had to

866
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,260
ask the kernel to please connect me to a

867
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,200
place or please accept a connection and

868
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,780
that gave the kernel or perhaps some bit

869
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,579
of endpoint detection and response

870
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:17,400
software an opportunity to decide

871
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,859
whether that connection was in our best

872
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:21,560
interests or not

873
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,839
that won't happen now you will not be

874
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:28,200
able to tell in EDR software or in a

875
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,380
kernel when a connection is being

876
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,800
started up or accepted which direction

877
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,560
who initiated where it's going you'll

878
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,300
know the IP address at the far end and

879
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,859
that's it

880
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:44,160
um and that is going to mean that again

881
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,079
this this whole thing where we're doing

882
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,420
this behavioral business and and

883
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,460
interrupting system calls in order to

884
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,579
get some kind of security is lame uh

885
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,260
none of us would choose it if we had

886
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,060
other choices it we don't have other

887
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,460
choices so we do this and now this

888
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,920
choice is being taken from us

889
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,619
um and you're going to need to be ready

890
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:10,680
for uh malware to exercise its rights

891
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,460
um now we do get one silver lining there

892
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:18,020
uh to the extent that you are going to

893
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,420
interrupt this in some way like causing

894
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,640
UDP to fail so it you know it falls back

895
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,200
to TCP causing TLS 1.3 to fail so it

896
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,400
would fall back to TLS 1.2

897
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,859
then you look like a a malware reverse

898
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,560
engineer and so a lot of malware is

899
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,240
evasive and if it thinks that you're

900
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,180
watching it if it thinks it's running in

901
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,960
a VM on some researchers desk it will

902
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,140
not behave badly because it doesn't want

903
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,920
to be researched and so you as a site

904
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,800
Security administrator doing something

905
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,700
to interrupt this new completely uh you

906
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,260
know perfect entropy environment where

907
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,940
you can't see anything you're going to

908
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,040
look like a reverse engineer so a lot of

909
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,740
malware will just decide not to behave

910
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,540
badly on your network because it can't

911
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,380
tell the difference between a state

912
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,240
Security administrator and a malware

913
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,540
engineer so one small cool thing that we

914
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,119
get out of this so

915
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,560
um

916
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,900
I made these slides before I had

917
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,240
completed completed my uh my corporate

918
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,579
training about getting permission uh

919
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,420
before using images so my apologies to

920
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,460
uh the copyright holder but this is

921
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,619
pretty public information this was a

922
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,260
famous episode of a famous TV series

923
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,680
from the 60s where a computer

924
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,020
took over the ship and wanted to make

925
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,940
sure that nothing could stop it and so

926
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,420
power was the thing it just had to have

927
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,619
um this is

928
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:56,780
so predictive of what we're doing now

929
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,520
that I just I had to use it

930
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,579
so looks like I have five minutes

931
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,119
according to this clock down there

932
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,940
and I am hoping we get a little bit of

933
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,079
discussion going on this

934
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,300
hey man hey Paul how you doing uh great

935
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,040
talk really appreciate you coming out

936
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,500
and sharing this with us

937
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,420
um I am preferring to remain anonymous

938
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,119
for a privacy reasons

939
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,099
um it seems like in the early days we

940
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,320
have an Internet that grows and grows

941
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,640
and grows and we're all celebrating we

942
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,780
have all these endpoints we can connect

943
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,640
to it seems like we're at the point now

944
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,740
where maybe we don't need to have two

945
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,540
billion endpoints be able to access by

946
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,420
PC for your baby monitor so I wonder if

947
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,859
maybe the right approach is as you're

948
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:50,400
saying uh develop better and more

949
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,560
automated white listing types of systems

950
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,079
so if me for my own use I can say these

951
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,520
are the destinations that this Good

952
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,339
Housekeeping seal of approval uh says

953
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:02,720
are reasonable and good sites to go to

954
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,400
that is something we might think of if

955
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,200
we had choices

956
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,520
um and I think we should probably

957
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,079
pretend that we have choices and

958
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,599
actually follow that I would like it to

959
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,760
be that your average home Gateway you

960
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,160
know DSL modem whatever it is

961
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,619
um negotiates with the endpoints and

962
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,720
says these are the conditions under

963
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,780
which you may leave my house

964
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,820
and the endpoint will say I don't like

965
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,500
those conditions so I'm just not going

966
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,119
to work and you'll have to return me to

967
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,839
the store or something but rather than

968
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,780
what we do now where we try to do things

969
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,700
to the endpoint without the end point

970
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,920
knowing and now the endpoint is trying

971
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,099
to evade that you know the if if the

972
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:45,599
owner of your network won't give you

973
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,940
permission to speak off net then you

974
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,400
should either not speak off net or or

975
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,680
something but that's going to take a lot

976
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,800
of work uh it's going to have to be go

977
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,660
through the ietf which is going to

978
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,160
wonder why are we doing this because it

979
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,079
means that let's say an authoritarian

980
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,359
country might just say okay you know

981
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,859
unless you allow me to decrypt

982
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,319
everything you said you can't get out of

983
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:10,200
here why should we give dictators that

984
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,020
that type of control well that's a

985
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,240
discussion in and of itself and I'll be

986
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,839
at the bar later

987
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,720
yes sir hi Lee Howard from ipv4. Global

988
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,540
by hilco streambank which is also a heck

989
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,400
of an identity um but yeah thank you

990
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,700
also um because I was also at the IET at

991
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,140
the time saying let's not do this this

992
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,880
seems like a bad idea there are there

993
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,380
are cases here where we're weakening our

994
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,839
security by ensuring our practicing

995
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:37,560
um

996
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,180
you described that there may be some

997
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,220
things that that are predictably

998
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,480
um we could expect firewall Security

999
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,300
Site administrators to do in response

1000
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,640
um there may be opportunities for groups

1001
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,859
like this to get together around a lunch

1002
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,420
table and come up with some best

1003
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,040
practice documents or or practice

1004
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,079
documents at least say here's what you

1005
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,760
need to do if you are in charge of

1006
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,980
securing a network

1007
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,480
um do you think that

1008
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,520
efforts like that might be able to

1009
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,099
result in a feedback loop to the ietf or

1010
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,319
are they just a lost cause

1011
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:10,800
I do and you know I don't want to see

1012
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,599
him hopeful but

1013
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:13,980
um

1014
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,700
the my

1015
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,819
Decades of work in this field have

1016
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:24,780
taught me that road builders always win

1017
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,500
against wall Builders and so if we

1018
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,260
create some way to do this more securely

1019
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,960
and we've got multiple interoperable

1020
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,859
implementations open source yada yada

1021
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:39,480
it'll catch on right because there is

1022
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,359
going to be a huge need for this most

1023
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:43,859
people have no idea that it's coming

1024
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,319
most people who have a next-gen firewall

1025
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,119
are saying okay I solved my problem they

1026
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,359
don't have a plan for when TLS 1.3 puts

1027
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,640
that firewall out of business but they

1028
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,099
will find out this is going to catch the

1029
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,780
World by surprise and then everybody's

1030
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,400
going to be up in arms they're going to

1031
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,020
be looking for Solutions and I think

1032
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,540
that we could absolutely build one now I

1033
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,000
want to say

1034
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,359
before the the time runs out quick is a

1035
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,000
huge engineering effort and it allows

1036
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,280
the congestion control that we've been

1037
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,400
doing in TCP to be done in user mode and

1038
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,980
that's bad in one way because it used to

1039
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,020
be you could upgrade your

1040
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,180
your congestion control just by updating

1041
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,740
the operating system and your apps

1042
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,480
didn't need to know about it now the app

1043
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,339
has to link against a later version of

1044
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:32,280
the library and maybe they won't all do

1045
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,839
it and so it's going to be a little

1046
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,940
worse but it's going to allow for much

1047
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,339
more rapid innovation in things like

1048
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:40,619
congestion control and so that will give

1049
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,800
us a lot more ability to fix let's say

1050
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,859
the buffer bloat problem and you know

1051
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:49,740
quick is a good protocol from an

1052
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,960
engineering standpoint and I have only

1053
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,000
respect for the people who have put

1054
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,800
their put their shoulders to it it's

1055
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,700
just the societal impact that worries me

1056
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,200
yes sir

1057
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,780
hi um my name is David tuber from

1058
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,700
cloudflare um the great talk really

1059
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,900
liked it

1060
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,300
um one question uh with all the Privacy

1061
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,560
stuff that's coming out of these

1062
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,720
protocols if most of the users who are

1063
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,099
using these Protocols are actually just

1064
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:15,720
sending their data to Google and

1065
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,640
Facebook and anybody who will just take

1066
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,380
their data and then resell it what is

1067
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,300
the value of having this privacy and

1068
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,980
stuff at all if you know we're just kind

1069
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,780
of giving up our data freely for

1070
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,300
consumption

1071
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,819
you seem to have read shoshana zipkoff's

1072
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,579
book about surveillance capitalism

1073
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:37,440
um uh let me say that uh

1074
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,780
that is what I meant when I asked you

1075
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,700
all to look for a CAT 5 Jack on the back

1076
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,920
of your head because we're we're letting

1077
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,900
the makers of our servers and our

1078
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,960
clients decide uh what will happen to

1079
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,960
our information and uh we're saying that

1080
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,180
it's okay that we have no idea what it

1081
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,480
is but let me answer your question a

1082
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,160
little more directly there's a famous

1083
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,880
lawsuit famous in the DNS field anyway

1084
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,000
where Comcast sued Google over DNS over

1085
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,660
https and in their lawsuit they said the

1086
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,700
thing that nobody is ever allowed to say

1087
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,920
but the lawyers didn't know that this is

1088
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,660
something you never say so they said it

1089
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,319
they said Google and Comcast are in the

1090
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:22,020
advertising business we both need to

1091
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,560
monitor DNS traffic and by using Doh

1092
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,200
Google is acting in an anti-competitive

1093
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,000
way they're saying that they get to see

1094
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,119
our users DNS traffic but we Comcast do

1095
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,260
not

1096
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,720
shocking that they said the thing you

1097
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,380
never say out loud but that is the real

1098
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,859
world and I'm not saying Google was

1099
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:46,920
doing any of this for that reason but I

1100
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,980
will say that when only endpoints can

1101
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,440
see what's going on the only endpoints

1102
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,440
will decide uh who gets to see it and

1103
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,040
that's to me interesting

1104
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,900
last question

1105
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,520
hey Paul

1106
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,099
um Joe Provo Google Aaron AC speaking

1107
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,460
for myself did I hear a glimmer of hope

1108
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,200
um when you were talking about endpoint

1109
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,300
signaling does that mean you think mud

1110
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,520
is the right way to go for these baby

1111
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,280
monitors and so forth to Signal what

1112
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,220
they are Desiring to do

1113
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,399
foreign

1114
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,940
it's an imposed choice and it's one you

1115
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,520
would only make if you are where we are

1116
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,020
now

1117
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,339
um so I don't want to make it sound

1118
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:34,619
attractive in any other sense but in

1119
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:37,859
context yes uh the the old firewall

1120
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:40,380
traversal working group that tried to do

1121
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,680
this back in the 90s

1122
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,720
was ahead of its time and now that we

1123
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,119
have enough transistors and enough watts

1124
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,060
of power we need to re-explore that but

1125
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,020
I gotta tell you that the iot makers are

1126
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,000
in a terrible economic condition they

1127
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,160
you know your average iot device will

1128
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,579
never make money from its own sales it's

1129
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:05,579
only because it gets to put a microphone

1130
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:07,980
in your house and and listen to what you

1131
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,040
say and somehow monetize the result that

1132
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,960
that company will ever make money from

1133
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,180
you buying that device so if we tell

1134
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,040
them yeah that's off the table we're

1135
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,079
going to make your device negotiate with

1136
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,540
my secure exit Gateway and it's only

1137
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,980
going to let you do what the homeowner

1138
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,380
are things you should be doing those

1139
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,760
companies are going to fight it tooth

1140
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,319
and nail

1141
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,420
and that's that's our show thank you

1142
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,420
very much

1143
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:35,860
