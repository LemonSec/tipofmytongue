91
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,620
elections a little different this year

92
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,879
um the elections aren't going to open

93
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,580
until after the board presentations

94
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,540
so the board presentations and Q a with

95
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,920
the potential board candidates will

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
occur and then elections will open and

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
they will remain open for one week

98
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,580
um some stats we have this Nifty stat

99
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,940
page on the on the web page now it has

100
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,480
Network stats attendance stats um you

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,220
can see here this is from this morning

102
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,480
we have

103
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,760
um I know we've tipped over this

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,280
um over a thousand registered attendees

105
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,560
if you include virtual which we are very

106
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,299
grateful to have our virtual attendees

107
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,340
That Couldn't travel

108
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,139
um but I find this really interesting

109
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,959
this demographic stat

110
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
um there's a lot you know we can

111
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,740
probably start doing more than this but

112
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,120
this is a fascinating one when you have

113
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,100
a moment take a look at it

114
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,380

um the speed how many people are

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,660
connected all that this will continue to

118
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,639
grow the network stats page I do

119
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,500
recognize this is extremely light for a

120
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,540
network stat page for this audience

121

um I'm Ryan planchart pronouns he him

222
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,220
his been at Netflix since 2014. I have

223
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,140
been working remotely from my home in

224
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,540
Maryland for about the last 10 years

225
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,640
uh during my time at Netflix I've worn a

226
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,320
few hats uh starting out with network

227
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,760
engineering little stint Network

228
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,399
architecture and now I run an absolutely

229
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,920
amazing team of network engineers and

230
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,360
Shout out I think they're in the

231
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,420
building

232
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,580
uh before Netflix I was at Comcast I

233
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,200
worked the overnight shift did all sorts

234
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,820
of fun and crazy things on their

235
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,399
backbone and cran or Regional networks

236
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,480
uh that was a lot of fun

237
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,880
so I wanted to really quickly uh share

238
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,080
something that was recently shared with

239
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,600
me uh by my friend Michael Costello who

240
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,220
I see right here hey MC it's good to see

241
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,640
you uh it's a picture of the at T long

242
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,740
distance Lobby in New York City this is

243
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,800
32 out of the Americas in New York

244
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,740
this artwork was commissioned in 1932 by

245
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,380
an artist named Hildreth mirror and at

246
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,560
the time Mira was asked to create a

247
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,120
design

248
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,180
that would symbolize the building as the

249
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,399
center of communication and I think she

250
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,920
kind of nailed it because uh one of the

251
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,420
reasons is at the bottom of the quote

252
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,600
reads telephone wires and radio unite to

253
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,660
make neighbors of Nations and a big part

254
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,240
of what has allowed Netflix and open

255
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,000
connect to reach so many people all over

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,140
the world

257
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,940
is the Partnerships that we formed with

258
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,100
many of the people in this room and many

259
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,959
other parts of the world

260
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,940
so Netflix's goal is to share stories

261
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,260
and entertain folks all over the world

262
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,300
and so to me

263
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,959
this art at the ATT building is a

264
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,579
reminder of the value of that

265
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,000
partnership

266
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,399
all right and to that note that's why we

267
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,680
keep and continue investing in being the

268
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,440
best Partners we can be at open connect

269
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,060
we're working on features in our partner

270
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,140
portal that gives isps a control over

271
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,480
how they how they their Netflix traffic

272
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,399
is delivered as well as some really cool

273
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,760
insights and analytics into that traffic

274
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,320
we've also spun up a new service

275
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,600
management team uh their Charter is to

276
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,459
provide high quality service and support

277
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,560
to all of our ISP Partners so that's

278
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,240
ones that we already work with and ones

279
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,880
that we are onboarding into the program

280
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,860
and Netflix is also investing in

281
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,200
emerging Talent so I think I saw nine

282
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,839
students here uh the Netflix emerging

283
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,220
Talent team we've got a fantastic

284
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,100
program uh we're offering internships

285
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,019
where we're actually embedding interns

286
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,459
directly into engineering groups at

287
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,600
Netflix

288
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,420
and we're also setting up uh new grads

289
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,820
with engineering roles within Netflix as

290
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,899
well

291
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,720
and of course we're investing in nanog

292
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,860
we've got folks involved in various

293
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,079
committees so shout out to Kevin and

294
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,279
Ikea

295
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,920
and uh we're super proud and happy to be

296
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,540
sponsoring the 986 hi

297
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,480
all right so we are celebrating 25 years

298
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,380
of Netflix this year which is crazy uh

299
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,240
but that's not it we're also celebrating

300
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,459
10 years of open connect which is

301
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,260
Netflix's purpose-built content delivery

302
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,160
Network

303
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,200
come a super long way and I figured I'd

304
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,700
just give you guys a quick rundown quick

305
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,680
update of how we got here

306
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,779
so we decided to give this stream video

307
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,720
thing a try back in 2007 and before that

308
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,000
it was all red envelopes and DVDs by

309
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,180
mail

310
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,440
in 2009 we started working with

311
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,420
third-party cdns to deliver our content

312
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,820
and over the next two years it became

313
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,980
very clear that we wanted to deliver

314
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,500
this content ourselves and so open

315
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,720
connect our in-house CDN was formed

316
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,680
we spent our earlier years building up

317
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,959
the uh the capability the capacity of

318
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,120
the CDN uh we're building Partnerships

319
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,500
and working to really just make these

320
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,200
CDN as efficient as it possibly could be

321
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,019
and then by 2020 we had surpassed 200

322
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,540
million paying members

323
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,180
and so that looks like 20 000 servers

324
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,779
and over 170 countries over 20 000

325
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,600
servers and over 170 countries servicing

326
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,700
over a million requests per second so

327
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,600
it's kind of a big deal

328
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,839
so how do we do it well for starters we

329
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,839
put ocas all over the world uh open

330
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,540
connect serves 100 of the Netflix video

331
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,120
traffic 100 all of it

332
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,279
uh we try and get our services close to

333
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,200
our mutual as close to our subscribers

334
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,540
as possible uh that provides a great low

335
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,399
latency experience and it's good for

336
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,899
isps too because you don't have to carry

337
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,459
the Netflix traffic over such long

338
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,320
distances

339
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
our CDN is very distributed and so once

340
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,820
server failing doesn't bring the whole

341
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,440
thing down if one fails another is ready

342
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,240
to take over

343
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,639
and when things do go wrong we actually

344
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,760
have uh Advanced tooling and insights in

345
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,440
our partner portal to help isps

346
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,240
understand when the ocas in their

347
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,760
Network are not performing uh properly

348
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,339
foreign

349
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,420
of our CDN are the many peering

350
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,040
presences and appearing locations we

351
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,200
have around the world we have 98 of them

352
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,540
so these are these are Netflix managed

353
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,360
pops with giant racks of ocas capable of

354
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,760
serving tons and tons of bandwidth

355
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,279
multi-terabits of bandwidth

356
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,100
um if you're appearing with as2906 this

357
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,600
is what's on the other side of those bgp

358
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,800
sessions

359
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,240
and you can always check out our

360
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,680
peeringdb page if you want to know what

361
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,839
facilities we're at this picture was

362
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,839
taken at 1950 Stemmons in Dallas

363
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,940
all right running low on time I gotta

364
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,980
hook real fast

365
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,540
so now we're going to zoom in on one of

366
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,300
these ocas and uh this is where the real

367
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,240
magic happens this is the Rev 1.58 it's

368
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,519
capable of doing 150 gigabits per second

369
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,519
in a 2u package uh it's got a super cool

370
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,440
e-ink display that I just absolutely

371
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,940
love

372
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,139
um

373
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,639
and these really are some of the most

374
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,920
efficient appliances in the world and

375
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,480
what's unique about our use case is that

376
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,459
we operate with a finite Universe of

377
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,620
content and so the popularity of that

378
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,260
content is extremely predictable

379
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,079
and we can pre-position that content

380
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,560
very efficiently and provide close to

381
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,040
100 offload at prime time

382
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,019
we also fill the caches with new content

383
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,339
overnight when traffic is low

384
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,620
we are appearing on over 100 internet

385
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,899
exchanges from those pops and so if you

386
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,579
don't have ocas in your network chances

387
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,620
are there are some ocas that are not far

388
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,980
from you

389
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,740
getting down to the end here

390
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,380
uh We've also built out it's supposed to

391
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,240
be a video we've also built out the open

392
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,220
connect backbone uh connects all of our

393
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,980
Pops together and we use this backbone

394
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,899
to do all sorts of things we use it to

395
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,180
fill our caches uh we've used this

396
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,600
backbone to create a global TCP anycast

397
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,060
acceleration Service uh improving

398
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,040
connectivity between Netflix clients and

399
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,959
Netflix cloud services

400
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,060
and we're also using our backbone to

401
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,820
provide ISP services to Netflix Studios

402
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,560
and offices including the Netflix

403
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,079
studios here in Los Angeles open connect

404
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,279
is the ISP to those places

405
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,220
oh there we go

406
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,590
it's Jim Burns effect

407
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,410

online at nanog.org surveys last Nano we

495

actually updated them they're much

496
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,919
simpler cleaner and quicker than the
