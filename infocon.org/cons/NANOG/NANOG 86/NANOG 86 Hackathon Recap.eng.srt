hackathon

6
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:48,180
we try to make sure that we provide a

7
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,180
lab environment to all the participants

8
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,520
provide a theme that they can use this

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,739
live environment to craft or build

10
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,980
whatever that they want to work on

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,600
additionally Foster team building to get

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,220
this educational Mission reaching

13
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,439
multiple attendees you can come into the

14
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,540
hackathon with little to no experience

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,420
with network engineering coding or even

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,460
a technical background at all and we

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,720
want to make sure that this environment

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,780
is always a welcoming and safe space for

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,040
people to share their knowledge ideally

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
you know across teams or if they want to

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,119
work individually as well so yeah in

22
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,360
general we try to help organize and

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,700
Achieve nanog's educational Mission by

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,460
putting on the hackathon in general and

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,320
uh making sure that everybody's having a

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,119
good time Chris tell me about your

27
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,299
experience so far at hackathon okay I've

28
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,340
been coming to these hackathons first as

29
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,900
an attendee and then as part of the

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,720
subcommittee for a number of years

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,299
what I've really noticed about it is

32
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,979
that you get a lot of exposure to new

33
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,020
ideas

34
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,640
I've been in this business for over 20

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
years I've been I've in many ways my

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,840
methods have calcified

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,360
and coming to a hackathon is a really

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,520
good way to see new ways of doing things

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,459
and to take us back to my day job and

40
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,680
keep you know ways to keep up on newer

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,680
technology and newer techniques just in

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,800
in methods that don't necessarily force

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,379
me to go and seek these things out

44
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,780
myself here I can come to hackathon work

45
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,379
with team members and you know just just

46
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,180
today someone showed me a new tool that

47
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,040
I had never seen before and he actually

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,379
updated that lab topology

49
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,500
to integrate it into the thing into that

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,140
topology so this new lab that he helped

51
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,300
me work work with and showed me a new

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,920
tool that works with it we may use that

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,319
in the next hackathon so that everybody

54
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,840
can make at make use of that next time I

55
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,459
look at these tools and I think about

56
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,080
how I can then array them back when I go

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,540
back to my day job as well absolutely

58
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,000
that's so cool to hear that perspective

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,700
of even like this you you never stop

60
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,360
learning no matter no you can't this is

61
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,700
this is not a business where you can

62
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,620
afford to stop learning there's just so

63
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,319
much development so much Innovation

64
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,980
people think of networking as wires you

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,500
know just hardware switches old you know

66
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,040
Telecom looking from the outside it

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,080
seems like a very boring

68
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,940
area of technology and it is not and

69
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,040
and coming here and seeing that is is

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,319
one thing that reinforces that

71
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,360
why is it not boring because a lot of

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,620
things are changing

73
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,500
um you know so a couple people at the

74
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,239
table outside we were talking about oh

75
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,400
remember when this was the fastest you

76
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,540
could imagine doing things I remember

77
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,120
when we had to when we had when 1.5

78
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,080
megabits was an amazing speed now that's

79
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,299
nothing 100 gigabits per second is now

80
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,580
the norm for an Enterprise network

81
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,379
connection you know there are tons of

82
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,940
advances in the technology and Hardware

83
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,799
software

84
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,659
um automation to management and that's

85
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,980
really the focus of what we're doing

86
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,459
here at the hackathon is using using new

87
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,459
software techniques to help manage

88
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,700
fleets of network devices routers

89
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,819
servers monitoring there's so much

90
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,918
Innovation and it's very hard you know

91
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,238
it's too much for one person to keep

92
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,740
track of so so being exposed to all of

93
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,180
this different Innovations is people

94
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,400
pick up different things you've got

95
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,560
people from college page programs and

96
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,639
bringing server or systems know-how into

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,639
the network space because

98
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,919
a router a network switch a network

99
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,620
device it is never coming

100
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,080
indistinguishable from other systems

101
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,180
from servers they're all running Linux

102
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,740
under the hood

103
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,360
um just with they just have to have more

104
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,639
ethernet ports on them so a lot of the

105
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,900
same techniques apply and we've been

106
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,639
learning that more and more over time

107
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,440
has been going on

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,020
um 10 20 years ago router switches

109
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,580
network devices were very very

110
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,699
purpose-built and but we're seeing that

111
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,820
wall coming down very quickly between

112
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,080
the techniques that are used by Network

113
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,699
engineers and the techniques that are

114
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,139
used by System engineers and assistant

115
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,080
men's so seeing those technology

116
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,720
families merge together has been pretty

117
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,120
interesting to watch but it also means

118
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,180
that we have to learn our new tricks

119
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:34,339
[Music]

120
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,900
so Leo you were actually bringing a

121
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,240
project to this nanog86 hackathon can

122
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,740
you tell me more about that

123
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,020
uh I'm bringing the pairing DB project

124
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,300
to nanog86 hackathon uh the theme is to

125
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,560
package up tools and we're bringing uh

126
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,460
packaging pairing dbpy pairing dbpy is a

127
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,280
local cache of the pairingdb database

128
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,080
that you can install on your own

129
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,520
infrastructure

130
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,720
and because it's on your own

131
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,820
infrastructure there are no query limits

132
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,800
you can query it as heavily as you want

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,020
and of course no one knows what you're

134
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,220
querying about and if you aren't very

135
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,740
good at writing efficient queries that's

136
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,780
not a problem for us because it's

137
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,400
running on your machine

138
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,520
at the moment it's

139
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,319
um

140
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,780
semi-documented for installation and so

141
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,960
we've been working on installing it on

142
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,240
different systems and working out what

143
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,560
the prerequisites are and I've written a

144
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,860
little 300 word how-to that will help

145
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,319
people get going if they want to install

146
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,720
purine dbpy on their local

147
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
infrastructure so what have been the

148
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,080
conversations and questions that

149
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,120
participants have asked you today

150
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,880
so we've uh had conversations about

151
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,639
using API Keys we've had conversations

152
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,479
about what pairing DB is and we've also

153
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,280
discussed

154
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,199
um installing it on different operating

155
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,240
systems so what's been the most

156
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,819
challenging part of this

157
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,560
um the challenging part is to integrate

158
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,780
everything and make like a proof of

159
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,880
concept

160
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,979
so because when you integrate multiple

161
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,759
tools a few things don't work so that

162
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,220
was a challenging part so how do you

163
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,440
overcome those challenges we have a team

164
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,840
for that so everyone comes up with a

165
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,740
solution on how to overcome these

166
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,259
challenges and that's how we and you

167
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,580
really do have a solid team over there

168
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,020
I've been watching you guys and you

169
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,660
you're very much seem very insane and

170
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,580
collaborative yeah what's the secret to

171
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,560
your sauce we have been together in the

172
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,620
same class so we know each other well

173
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,759
and we think with the ideas and everyone

174
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,520
supports each other so that's the main

175
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,139
thing

176
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,139
so

177
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,340
um Barry this isn't your first hackathon

178
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,379
tell us about how many hackathons you've

179
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,479
actually participated in I think I've

180
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,500
participated in four now since uh 2020.

181
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,280
wow so this is number four was number

182
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,159
four better worse how are you feeling so

183
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,380
far it's not it it's not done yet but oh

184
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,320
it's awesome because it's in person and

185
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,539
I didn't have to travel very far that's

186
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,958
true San Diego is just around the corner

187
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,820
so what was what was the project you

188
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,200
worked on today

189
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,200
um I'm helping Sean with uh he had a

190
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
network path tool idea where he wanted

191
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,160
to

192
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,980
calculate shortest path on a bunch of

193
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,740
paths and make sure they were diverse

194
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,300
what did you learn during that

195
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,420
experience I learned a lot about the

196
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,640
network X Library from python which I

197
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,779
had no idea existed and it is immense so

198
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,399
yeah that's one of the cool things about

199
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,560
these events is that you get your hands

200
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,200
on new yeah all the the latest and

201
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,360
greatest

202
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,980
technology Trends as you mentioned

203
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,560
before you are here from CU Boulder

204
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,580
which has one of the top tier

205
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,100
engineering programs in the country how

206
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,640
do events like hackathon help you in the

207
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,500
coursework that we learn it's mostly

208
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,720
like labs and assignments that is based

209
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,300
on a particular problem stating we don't

210
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,839
really get a time to brainstorm our own

211
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,440
projects so when we come to hackathons

212
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,300
based on the theme we come up with the

213
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,680
new with new ideas of how those can be

214
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,899
helpful in the industries so that gives

215
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,279
kind of an entrepreneurial start for uh

216
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,820
developers or anyone who are students

217
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,920
but anyone of that sort who wants to

218
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,080
start their own project anything you're

219
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,000
going to do differently next year I'm

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,060
not sure it's going to depend on uh what

221
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,480
pairing DB needs to do uh in what uh

222
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,120
what project we bring and also what the

223
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
theme is from Nano but we will come back

224
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,760
with another project I'm sure and we'll

225
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,800
try and make it relevant and I hope that

226
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,899
people enjoy working on it has there

227
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,279
been any lessons over the years where

228
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,779
you were just like you know what this

229
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,820
doesn't work this is how

230
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,420
we're gonna do it from now on I think

231
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,120
the thing that I learned the second time

232
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,279
was that it's not all about developing

233
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,060
software it's really about meeting

234
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,760
people and

235
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,860
getting a little bit of progress on a

236
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,560
project even if you don't get code that

237
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,459
can be deployed and so it's it's not

238
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,079
that you have to be a software developer

239
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,600
like today's project is about working

240
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,640
out what you need to install some

241
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,399
existing software and previous projects

242
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,060
have been about designing a potential

243
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,240
new feature and so coming to a hackathon

244
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,220
you don't need to be a software

245
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,339
developer you can be someone who just

246
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,440
understands this industry or wants to

247
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,480
learn about this industry and you can

248
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,980
have a positive impact at the hackathon

249
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,839
you don't necessarily traditionally

250
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,120
think about like how important it is to

251
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,240
network and make those professional

252
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,700
connections can you talk more about that

253
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,500
the hackathon here today and also at the

254
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,959
last nanog you know we've got students

255
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,820
and we've got really seasoned

256
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,860
professionals who have been in the

257
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,120
industry for decades

258
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,899
and it's great to have people who really

259
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,820
know what they're doing

260
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,740
um share some of their experience and

261
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,200
it's great to have people who are at the

262
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,540
start of their careers share enthusiasm

263
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,220
and come up with new and interesting

264
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,240
ideas and so that Meeting of Minds is

265
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,600
really valuable because the people who

266
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,399
are coming at the start of their careers

267
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,959
are the people who are going to be here

268
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,820
in 20 years time

269
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,060
closing words don't forget to have fun

270
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,000
