threat landscape report John is a

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,779
principal Analyst at netscout and a PhD

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,740

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,859
excuse me

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,640
John first spoke at nanog in 2004 and

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,159
today marks his 19th presentation at

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,480
nanog

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,579
John is also a valued member of the

nanog program committee welcome back to

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,480
the stage John we're happy to have you

16

[Applause]

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,219
thank you very much Michael

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,780
hello good afternoon

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,480
so for those of you who don't know who I

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,640
am you can probably learn as much as you

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,199
care to by searching Around the Net but

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,199
briefly my role at netscout is a as it

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,699
says here once I was a principal analyst

25
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,159
but what that means is I work with our

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,040
data that we get from contributions from

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,439
customers so before we get started what

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,520
you're about to see I want to kind of

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,340
give you a little bit of an idea of how

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,100
we do what we do and produce some of the

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,020
plots and some of the data that we got

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,220
so netsco is a it's an organization that

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,720
does lots of network oriented things but

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,400
our particular group is mainly involved

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,299
in Adidas mitigation and protection so

36
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,979
some of you are probably familiar with

37
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,860
old Arbor networks Peak flow product and

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,180
now it's known as sight line that's

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,439
essentially the group that I'm in we

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
look at the data that we get from

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,700
customers who contribute DDOS attack

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,320
alerts back to us so we get not exactly

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,240
like a netflow record but we get

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,180
something that's derived from impart net

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,380
flow we get summaries of attacks that

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,079
describe Source networks destination

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,040
networks protocols prefixes and and

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,159
something that those sorts of uh bits of

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,540
information like packets per second and

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,680
so forth that you might find in the

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,560
netflow record but I don't get to see

52
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,319
netflow records so all I get to see is a

53
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,760
summary of an attack alert an attack

54
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,099
alert has to be of medium or we classify

55
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,099
as a medium and higher threshold this is

56
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,200
data that comes back to us internally

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,879
only for our group to produce reports

58
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,800
like this and do blog posts and actually

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,140
to look for and monitor and analyze

60
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,780
Trends and to help inform our product

61
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,220
teams and to figure out how to actually

62
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,379
do DDOS mitigation in in some ways

63
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,480
better so that's what we do this data

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,620
doesn't go anywhere else it's not sold

65
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,700
to anybody it doesn't leave netscow

66
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,580
so our data isn't necessarily perfect

67
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,220
um our data is really just a view of

68
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,140
what we see and what we can reasonably

69
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,019
make put a stake in the ground towards

70
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,120
so like for instance they give you an

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,860
idea to give you sort of that stake in

72
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,420
the ground here's some numbers that we

73
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,099
could say with reasonably good

74
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,080
confidence of what we have observed in

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,000
the first half of this year so you know

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
some number of attack counts so what's

77
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,300
an attack it's simply something that our

78
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,720
our systems detect as exceeding some

79
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
threshold those medium or higher level

80
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,180
thresholds usually it's volumetric but

81
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,819
it could be some other means of uh some

82
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,440
defined thresholds and the product or

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,780
the customer sets so six million that's

84
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,700
roughly about what we've seen over the

85
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,400
last year or so so there's not much

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,019
change here so these these numbers are

87
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,840
somewhat to mean not as quite as

88
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,640
interesting as some of the plots that

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,840
I'll show you but if you care about

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,159
numbers some people care about internet

91
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,319
speed land records you know who's had

92
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,239
the biggest DDOS attack this year some

93
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,040
people care about that stuff I don't so

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,019
much sometimes it's interesting

95
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,879
sometimes the the reports of those are

96
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,459
even accurate oftentimes they're not

97
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,080
um sometimes we confirm some of the

98
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,019
reports that we see others making claims

99
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,340
about

100
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,959
um sometimes we might kind of Snicker

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,159
and say yeah probably wasn't actually

102
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,599
that big

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,299
um that's not really all that important

104
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,580
the other thing that to note is what we

105
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,860
see is is really because it's based more

106
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,140
or less on netflow our attacking vectors

107
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,060
is really based on what you might find

108
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,620
in in the netflow and how you might do

109
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,840
detection based on traffic flow that's

110
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,700
flowing through routers so you can see

111
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,320
the top vectors that we identify this

112
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,320
TCP act and sin and amplification you

113
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,660
know we can't tell you uh you know

114
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,160
anything about the payload because we

115
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,139
just don't see that so the vectors are

116
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,699
not necessarily congruent to what you

117
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,500
might think of as a traditional sort of

118
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,479
malware attack a specific type of you

119
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,639
know Mirai variant or that sort of thing

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,220
so that's all I kind of wanted to note

121
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,840
here to kind of give you an overview of

122
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,580
what we're able to see and how we

123
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,740
actually report it

124
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,100
so imperfectly or not we break down our

125
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,840
view of the world into four major

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
geographic regions so this is very

127
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,080
imperfect and it's probably unfair to

128
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,360
some countries and it's not really

129
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,680
necessarily a perfect picture of the

130
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,940
world because it all sort of gets

131
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,740
clustered together in the

132
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,780
the aggregate of everything that's

133
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,699
happening even into four major groups

134
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,800
you really can't always tell a whole lot

135
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,940
of what's happening but for instance

136
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,919
here you can see this these are attack

137
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,139
counts grouped by what we classify as

138
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,900
our regions so the top region in red is

139
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,600
this uh Europe Middle Eastern and Africa

140
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,460
region that's a pretty wide and diverse

141
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,620
region right that spans essentially from

142
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,419
the top of the northern hemisphere down

143
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,040
to the southern hemisphere all sorts of

144
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,039
cultures and religions and economies

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,440
populations then there's the Asia

146
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,759
Pacific region

147
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,280
which more also includes in countries

148
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,199
like from India over across to China

149
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,080
Philippines down uh towards Australia

150
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,820
New Zealand

151
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,460
um North America that's predominantly

152
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,280
made up of uh at least in bulk of the

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,340
DDOS attacks we see is is the U.S this

154
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,039
notable notable mention for Canada in

155
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,360
there in a couple other countries that

156
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,800
got classified in that group but it's

157
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,720
largely dominated by the U.S

158
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,400
and then Latin America which includes

159
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,780
all the countries essentially south of

160
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,520
the U.S from Mexico on down to the the

161
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,800
tip of South America

162
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,380
and also including the Caribbean

163
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,360
so looking at this graph there's not a

164
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,160
whole lot that necessarily really stands

165
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,539
out you might see a couple Peaks or

166
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,699
valleys and something that might look

167
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,560
like a Trends but it's actually hard to

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,539
make some things out here I think you

169
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,539
might notice perhaps that the um the top

170
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,460
red line graph here the your Middle

171
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,039
Eastern Africa region there does appear

172
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,240
to have been something that happened

173
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,680
around March and you can probably guess

174
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,319
what um that pertains to we'll look a

175
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,240
little bit more a little closely in a

176
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,160
moment

177
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,259
so I'm going to kind of go through some

178
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,780
of this quickly for sake of time but

179
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,060
when we look at classifying what we see

180
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,759
in terms of the types of attacks one

181
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,740
noticeable Trend that's been happening

182
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,840
over the past year is the the increasing

183
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,000
frequency more and more of what we call

184
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,819
Direct path attacks this is largely due

185
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,520
to the uh the malware that's taken

186
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,560
advantage of iot devices like the

187
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,259
variants like from Mirai where the

188
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,780
attacks aren't spoofed their direct pass

189
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,000
and so we still see significant volumes

190
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,340
of Booth to DNS and ntp and other types

191
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,440
of UDP based amplification

192
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,539
the direct pass stuff is really becoming

193
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,639
more and more predominant these days

194
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,199
perhaps that's a trend that will

195
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,380
continue it's unclear keep doing the BCP

196
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,020
38 stuff and anti-splufting bits because

197
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,660
that does help we see positive impact

198
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,699
when people do that but the direct path

199
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,599
stuff is increasing

200
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,580
Industries are probably not too much

201
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,620
unlike what you might expect the the

202
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,479
folks in this room the providers the

203
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,639
carriers the Telecommunications

204
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,580
organization the hosting providers

205
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,319
take on more or less the bulk of the

206
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,440
attack so this is really classified with

207
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,020
the enrichment tools that we use so it's

208
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,360
somewhat imperfect perhaps if we were to

209
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,400
kind of chop off the first four or five

210
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,960
bars of these you know things get a

211
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,160
little bit more interesting when we dig

212
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,800
on other types of Industries we can see

213
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,360
some interesting trends that happen in

214
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,160
banking or satellite Communications and

215
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,319
whatnot but still you all in this room

216
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,020
are largely at least from the

217
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,580
perspective of being on the receiving

218
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,919
end the destination of attacks still

219
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,919
receive the bulk of them

220
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,319
the duration of attacks tend to be very

221
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,599
short the picture is more or less the

222
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,039
same across all the four regions that

223
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,479
I've shown here there's little slight

224
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,039
differences but usually most attacks

225
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,479
don't last more than about 15 or so

226
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,520
minutes we do see some that last for

227
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,340
days but those tend to be the outliers

228
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,199
than the norm most attacks are actually

229
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,860
quite short

230
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,720
so we grew up in the four regions this

231
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
is just a rough summary of what the

232
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,458
regions look like from our perspective

233
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,880
this is aipac here's a grouping of some

234
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,458
of the countries in that group that we

235
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,080
thought we would highlight princess you

236
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,839
see this um very

237
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,060
specific standout Spike here in the

238
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,700
middle this blue line for those of you

239
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,339
that can make that out this actually

240
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,480
correlates to a an endorsement by the

241
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,540
Taiwanese government of Ukraine in March

242
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,399
when that endorsement was made that

243
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,660
public pronouncement in support of

244
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,420
Ukraine we noticed just briefly a number

245
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,000
of attacks increased towards the

246
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,820
Taiwanese region

247
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,500
there may be some other patterns in here

248
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,519
but I'll just point out that one for

249
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,839
here and I'm going to do the same for

250
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
some of the other countries as we go the

251
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,100
integrated industry is somewhat

252
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
interesting I'm going to kind of skip

253
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,580
over this you can look at this later if

254
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,500
you care to in the slide deck

255
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,600
here's one that I think maybe most of us

256
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,580
might be interested this time around the

257
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,160
European Middle East and Africa region

258
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
particularly there's a group of

259
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,459
countries that were involved in this

260
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,320
conflict in this war in Ukraine and the

261
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,200
Russian invasion

262
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,660
the right red line in this graph is

263
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,240
Russia and you can see that the number

264
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,279
of attacks that we observed towards

265
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,200
Russia increased dramatically about two

266
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
or three times uh beginning around the

267
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,519
start of March

268
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,860
and that's maybe not so surprising maybe

269
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,899
you would expect that what's maybe a

270
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,220
little bit less

271
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,260
um or a little with a little bit more

272
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,720
surprising is Ukraine

273
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,700
the Ukraine in this graph is in the

274
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,080
yellow line kind of towards the bottom

275
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,459
and things are kind of more or less

276
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,260
stable up until March I think you'll

277
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,360
notice a precipitous drop

278
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,720
and uh kind of stays down in this lower

279
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,360
region under 200 attacks per day now you

280
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,339
might try to venture I guess as

281
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,140
why

282
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,240
why was there such a dramatic rise in

283
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,339
attacks against Russia and why was this

284
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,160
drop in Ukraine some of you perhaps you

285
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,160
think maybe of a show of hands uh

286
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,019
infrastructure may be destroyed in

287
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,279
Ukraine who thinks maybe that was a

288
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,660
contributing factor a couple people

289
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,880
think that right that's it seems

290
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,260
reasonable

291
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,579
um perhaps it was attackers show sides

292
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:48,240
and some people thought uh I'm gonna you

293
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,680
know like much of the world cited with

294
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,899
Ukraine on this and so Russia is the bad

295
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:52,680
guys and so we're going to attack

296
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,660
Russian so maybe Russia just received

297
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,180
the bolts of attacks because uh Ukraine

298
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,940
enjoyed the world sympathy so maybe you

299
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,579
you feel that was the uh the reason for

300
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,839
this

301
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,680
um

302
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,200
what we believe is responsible for part

303
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,820
of this at least if not a significant

304
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,279
amount of that shift

305
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,620
for Ukraine in particular

306
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,019
is that it wasn't necessarily that the

307
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,120
Ukraine infrastructure was destroyed but

308
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,640
the Ukraine systems and the services

309
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,160
that were physically located and

310
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,500
geolocated according to our enrichment

311
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,459
data

312
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,519
moved out of Ukraine left went somewhere

313
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,560
else and so the attacks didn't

314
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,839
necessarily stop against what were UK

315
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,839
Ukraine targets but they just don't look

316
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:37,980
like they were targeting Ukraine

317
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,839
specific in the geographic country of

318
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,360
Ukraine so we highlighted here too you

319
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,980
see some other countries here like

320
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,800
Finland and Ireland in some places some

321
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,420
of these other countries will

322
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,060
uh receive additional attacks Ireland

323
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,920
for example is a curious example you

324
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,600
might think about why that might be you

325
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,940
know I'll tell you a little bit if you

326
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,279
uh think you might know or maybe call on

327
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,100
you so Finland received some attacks

328
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,640
largely uh because

329
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,640
their uh their endorsement also of NATO

330
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,120
wanting to enter into NATO

331
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,940
um and sympathies again aligned with

332
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,399
Russia decided to attack Finland so you

333
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,079
see lots of this sort of lead over

334
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,420
effect based on the politicalization of

335
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,199
these issues

336
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,680
um more and just this is actually

337
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,399
mislabel's APAC that should be EMA

338
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,019
um Latin America

339
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,360
um reasonably size about the same size

340
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,860
as some of these other regions in terms

341
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,019
of asns and countries

342
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,279
um a little bit

343
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,079
um different perspective in terms of

344
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,959
traffic Brazil here dominates as you you

345
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,519
might guess

346
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,920
um you see Colombia also plays a

347
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,139
significant role here and in fact there

348
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,200
was a uh an event where there was an

349
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,620
election where we see some attacks

350
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,160
that increase in Colombia here uh in the

351
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,360
early part of the year when there was

352
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,639
was the uh when the election was was

353
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,120
rampant

354
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,320
um some more top industry stuff maybe

355
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,660
the one thing to know here in Latin

356
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,980
America where we really see the

357
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,540
distinction the green bars indicate the

358
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,399
most latest data

359
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,560
um from 2022

360
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,480
and you you can see that the the

361
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,519
precipitous drop here from

362
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,399
um 2021 in the hosting providers the

363
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,500
Wireline providers the telecommunication

364
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,139
providers other things have increased of

365
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,899
course but noticeably those industry

366
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,600
sectors have decreased

367
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,100
in North America this is what the

368
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,260
picture looks like as you can see the US

369
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,540
really dominates this graph here from

370
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,880
our perspective depending on how you

371
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,339
count I don't know even the the two

372
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,019
countries that we include in North

373
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,000
America you can count up to 20 or 30

374
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,860
countries as part of North America but

375
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,420
no matter how you account the US really

376
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,660
does dominate this graph

377
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,940
here's the industries for North America

378
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,399
here's another picture of Russia Ukraine

379
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,560
I thought you might find interesting now

380
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,240
this is over a little bit longer time

381
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,519
scale so it goes back to 2021

382
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,440
but over towards the right you see that

383
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,720
large the now it's in light blue Russia

384
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,079
the attack traffic has increased uh

385
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,060
significantly the yellow again is

386
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,519
Ukraine it drops but you'll also see

387
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,160
here Finland Ireland Ireland

388
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,720
um

389
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,120
probably appropriately is in green that

390
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,100
is almost perfectly correlated with the

391
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,220
Ukraine drop of Ireland increase we

392
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,839
believe is is in large part because of

393
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,519
the infrastructure or some of the

394
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,660
infrastructure that was moved from

395
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,639
Ukraine to the so-called Cloud some of

396
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,500
that cloud being in Ireland so that's

397
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,180
why you see some of that shift there at

398
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,620
that that moment of time going from

399
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,120
Ukraine to to Ireland

400
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,760
um here's another view of the ripple

401
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,220
effect uh showing a point in time of of

402
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,860
when the invasion occurred and the

403
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,779
countries under perspective here the top

404
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,199
one being finland's again Finland

405
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,180
showing uh support for NATO wanted to

406
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,220
join NATO

407
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,360
um

408
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,160
on the bottom here's Ireland it's a

409
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,260
little bit less pronounced but here

410
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,880
again you do see

411
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,160
the shift in traffic that was from

412
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,779
Ukraine that moved over into Ireland

413
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,940
most likely because of of the effects of

414
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,100
of cloud infrastructure where things

415
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,540
were starting to be deployed that's

416
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,760
largely continued throughout this time

417
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,120
period

418
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,579
another graph showing some cause and

419
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,199
ripple effects I'm killing that is a

420
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:28,980
thing if you want to look up what

421
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,540
killing that is this is killnet is a

422
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,740
group

423
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,660
um reportedly made up of Russian hackers

424
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,339
that declare DDOS attacks against

425
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,100
different entities and they make threats

426
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
uh and and then you know we can see if

427
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,480
there's actually some correlated attack

428
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,399
events when these threats are made

429
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,600
sometimes there are sometimes there

430
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,579
aren't but you can see a few countries

431
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,980
here uh that are involved and sometimes

432
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,360
the threats amount almost nothing other

433
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,440
times they're a little bit more

434
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,860
interesting

435
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,699
one thing that we were kind of looking

436
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,800
for I think it's probably a little bit

437
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,300
hard to actually pull this out though

438
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,220
because the data is somewhat imperfect

439
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,980
how Satellite Communication networks get

440
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,660
classified is a little bit tricky I

441
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,860
think yet still because there's probably

442
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,800
a lot of that going on but we did see a

443
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,660
little bit of a rise in the tax against

444
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,459
satellite Communications you can

445
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:15,899
probably guess why this is the The

446
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,820
increased deployment of Communications

447
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,920
in Europe in particular

448
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,779
um we're seeing a little bit of a rise

449
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:22,740
there so we're going to be kind of

450
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,779
watching this over time this to see what

451
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,480
the effect of this is

452
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,519
now there's a whole bunch more that I

453
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,660
could show you that I just don't have

454
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,860
time to show you if you want to go take

455
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,180
a look there's nothing to sign up for

456
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,380
you just go to this link you can go

457
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,459
check out a whole bunch of other stuff

458
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,380
including more attack Vector stuff

459
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,120
specific botnets families all that kind

460
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,980
of good stuff there's more text so you

461
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,480
can read about some of this if you care

462
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,560
to

463
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,820
um if not if that's not good enough for

464
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,440
you if you have specific questions we

465
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,600
don't have time for today you can

466
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,339
certainly contact me there's my email

467
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,560
address here on this on the slide and I

468
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,060
think I've left probably three or four

469
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,980
or five minutes for questions if they're

470
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,860
already I'm happy to entertain them

471
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,870
thanks very much for your time attention

472
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:08,220
[Applause]

473
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,140
yes sir hey and thanks for the talk uh

474
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,819
Mike Start tracked a question around

475
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,540
like you you mentioned the the timing of

476
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,459
DDOS attacks is there any correlation

477
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,040
between who or where the attacks are

478
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,839
coming from and their motivation so

479
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,959
ideological political uh monetary thanks

480
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,660
yeah thanks thanks for your question so

481
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,480
um all the the graphs that I showed are

482
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,160
largely based around the destination of

483
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,020
the attacks right

484
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,580
um it's actually much easier for us to

485
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,080
do that because it's very easy to tell

486
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,340
where things are going as opposed to

487
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,260
where they can come from obviously

488
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,720
because they may be spoofed right so we

489
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
didn't actually invest a whole lot of

490
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,559
effort into seeing where things were

491
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,900
coming from necessarily for two reasons

492
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,100
one because of the spoofing effect

493
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,679
because we can't always be sure

494
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,419
um and two because it's often from a lot

495
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,860
of different places

496
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,900
um so that there's not necessarily one

497
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,280
predominant place where attacks are

498
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,080
coming from it's not necessarily that we

499
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,480
can't pinpoint specific you know hosting

500
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,860
providers or networks that are

501
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,419
responsible for a lot of addresses that

502
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,179
are responsible for spoofing or hosting

503
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,799
providers that have you know a lot of

504
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,380
iot devices that sort of thing we're not

505
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,400
necessarily always that interested

506
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,620
either in calling them out publicly and

507
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,480
shaming them you know we're a little bit

508
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,919
careful to not necessarily blame them

509
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,140
because it may or may not be uh

510
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,679
appropriate to do so but we we can see

511
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,120
some of that but that hasn't really been

512
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,240
our Focus recently it's interesting to

513
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,860
look at but maybe that's a separate

514
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,080
discussion the the financial motivation

515
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,940
is always there one of the suggestions I

516
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,400
had for a group was that's

517
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,980
um early on before we were looking at

518
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,780
this graph is why we weren't seeing many

519
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,820
attacks against Ukraine as we thought we

520
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,580
might When The War took place was I

521
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,960
thought maybe it's because there was no

522
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,520
Financial incentive for anyone to do

523
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,559
that you know a lot of the attackers

524
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,799
especially Uh Russian origin are very

525
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,539
financially motivated and if they

526
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,700
weren't being financially incentivized

527
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,020
to attack Ukraine maybe that's just

528
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,400
what's happening for that reason I don't

529
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,380
know if that's true or not

530
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,900
um I assume it could be true but

531
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,400
um I didn't look into that any further

532
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,480
than just sort of guessing

533
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,559
okay I think that's it thanks very much

534
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,340
again nothing online

535
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,290
