Levy is a lead engineer at at T an

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,480
active Community member Nimrod has

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,059
communicated coordinated connectivity

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,580
for nanog conferences in the past and he

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,039
spoke first spoke at the nadog stage in

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,859
2017. we're happy to welcome him back to

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,920
the stage for the third time today

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,080
presenting increasing IPv6 utilization

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,820
in consumer networks welcome

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,000
thank you

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,700
hi thanks for having me here

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,800
um so yeah we're gonna talk about

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,559
everybody's absolute favorite topic ever

17
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,719
IPv6

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,460
um because nobody's presented about that

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,640
today maybe

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,480
um

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,300
so I'm not really going to spend a lot

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,340
of time on you know what it is how it

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,379
works or whatever but we're going to

24
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,239
talk a little bit about why we really

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,480
really like for real this time need to

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,619
move to IPv6 because really

27
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,260
um yeah particularly looking at consumer

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,320
networks so you know I work at ATT so we

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,540
have a lot of Wireline customers a lot

30
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,340
of Wireless customers

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,439
um eventually we're gonna have to build

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,619
out uh some sort of cgn whether that's

33
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,500
you know Nat 444 or map t or whatever

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,580
really uh technology gets settled on

35
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,259
um there's going to have to be

36
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,240
someday somewhere we're going to do it

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,939
and the way the traffic currently sits

38
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,280
and we'll see some some charts on on

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,960
some of the breakdowns

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,500
uh it's the the scale of that cgn is

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,380
going to be immense uh there are going

42
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,759
to be other networks that that are going

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,340
to face those same kinds of problems

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,700
um so it's just there's so much V4 out

45
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,840
there that we're going to have to deal

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,060
with we really need to be shifting that

47
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,579
needle more than than what's been so far

48
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,619
um

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,520
so uh yes uh so the cgn so we a lot of

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,180
networks already support IPv6

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,920
um we have some

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,680
um at T you know Comcast lots of lots of

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,660
Provider service providers already

54
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,879
support V6 all the way down to the CPE

55
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,599
uh so the the networks are there a lot

56
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,239
of content providers already support V6

57
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,540
a lot of content is available over V6

58
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,140
so we support all the networks I think

59
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,819
not all the networks but a lot of the

60
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,599
networks are very much ready so how much

61
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,260
traffic are we really seeing in V6

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,360
um I kind of broke some some charts down

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,660
in uh looking at different kinds of uh

64
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,060
networks that connect to at t uh the

65
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,480
darker green shows the total traffic and

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,459
the lighter green overlaid is the amount

67
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,860
of V6 traffic that a DNT is receiving

68
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,560
from various kinds of networks so these

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,000
providers some of them look better than

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
others in terms of how much V6

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,819
um we we see from from particular

72
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,260
networks

73
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,379
um all the way up to over 80 percent

74
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,560
um some you know 60 percent

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,900
um you know this is a different provider

76
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,620
that does mostly streaming video

77
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,599
um they have a you know just lower

78
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,080
percentage but you know not bad

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,739
um

80
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,280
things get a little bit dicey this this

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,640
particular provider has uh you know

82
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,040
think VMS that uh that get spun up to

83
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,920
support different Cloud applications

84
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,599
um so they're you know much less

85
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,819
percentage

86
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,580
um and then these are CDN providers that

87
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,379
uh that don't host their own content but

88
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,700
you know distribute

89
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,599
um other

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,239
um other folks content and so they and

91
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,860
they all of these networks like you say

92
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,080
you can see here they have some V6 so

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,140
they all support V6

94
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,780
um but really why we're not just we're

95
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,819
not seeing very much this migration has

96
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:06,659
been

97
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,840
a long time coming and um we expect it's

98
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,700
going to have this very very long tail

99
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,760
uh moving forward from V6

100
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,339
so again I we started looking at it why

101
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,699
why don't we have more V6

102
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:21,440
um

103
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,540
this this number I'm not sure I really

104
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,699
like this number very much um mostly

105
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,259
because I don't know

106
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,800
exactly how they arrived at it this says

107
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,979
that you know the top thousand websites

108
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,960
uh globally only 28 of them have V6

109
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,840
I'm not sure how that how this number

110
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,000
maybe somebody can clarify that because

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,940
I didn't see it on uh on that website on

112
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,120
the this is from uh the internet Society

113
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,540
for example at T if you look up att.com

114
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,240
there's no Claude a record for it

115
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,000
um but if you open your web browser and

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,040
type att.com you're going to get a

117
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,740
redirect that goes to

118
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,419
www.att.com which is hosted by one of

119
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,660
those cdns that does in fact support

120
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,340
IPv6

121
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,560
so we know we have a lot of content

122
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,240
that's out there that supports V6 the

123
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,460
network support V6

124
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,080
maybe there's another reason that

125
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,020
there's not quite so much V6 traffic and

126
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,620
so I think that this might be part of it

127
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,720
this is a listing of a of an actual home

128
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,660
network the the green

129
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,100
on the left side is the list of devices

130
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,240
that uh that are connected to the

131
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,639
network and uh and on the the right

132
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,660
column

133
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,400
um the the green indicates where it has

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,259
a V6 address

135
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,460
um there are a few devices that might

136
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,740
not be connected at the time that that I

137
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,259
think could support V6 that aren't but

138
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,259
ultimately we've got 10 maybe 15 devices

139
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,660
out of 28

140
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,120
that are doing V6 that's not a great

141
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,740
number

142
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,860
so that kind of leads us to uh where

143
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,720
we're heading with this is

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,820
there's a lot I think that there's a lot

145
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,180
of content out there that supports V6

146
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,580
but is really being accessed to only on

147
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,020
V4

148
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,680
um because of these end devices

149
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,300
so how do we get these end devices

150
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,819
upgraded normally we need you know

151
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,080
vendors to push out software updates

152
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,180
we need consumers to buy you know

153
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,720
additional uh by new devices nobody

154
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,240
likes buying new stuff that basically

155
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,259
works

156
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:38,460
so

157
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,100
really how do we do this

158
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,680
can we get you know can we incentivize

159
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,199
the vendors to to support you know older

160
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,759
Hardware can we get them to push stuff

161
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,600
out

162
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,419
can we get you know uh customers to buy

163
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,759
new things how do we do this do we just

164
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,580
wait for stuff to age out

165
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,300
um

166
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,759
you know I don't know about you guys I

167
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,360
hate waiting

168
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,180
um

169
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,160
so

170
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,840
we got to looking at this and thinking

171
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,520
about the the problem a little bit more

172
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,400
and it occurs to me that we have

173
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,639
standards for Nat six dns-64 and that

174
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,979
six four so this is a standard where you

175
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,259
can have

176
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:22,560
islands of V6 only devices that can

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,000
communicate with V4 only services

178
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,660
the way this works is the uh roughly the

179
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,020
the client does a DNS request

180
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,720
um you have a modified DNS server that

181
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,500
that substitutes its own answer uh for

182
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,080
for the real answer and uh and you

183
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,060
forward that traffic to a translator the

184
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,919
net six the NAT portion of the net six

185
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:47,699
four

186
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,340
and you repackage this V6 packet into a

187
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,919
V4 packet send it on its way so you have

188
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,400
this uh this end-to-end communication

189
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,060
that uh between devices and devices that

190
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,060
speak different protocols

191
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,400
so why not turn it around

192
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,120
um let's do Nat four six and dns46 it

193
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,319
turns out to be a little bit more

194
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,160
complicated because in the dns-64

195
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,800
scenario you're able to take that ipv4

196
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,699
address of the the real server and embed

197
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,960
it into a V6 address and so you you get

198
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,259
to save that state in the address itself

199
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,599
clearly you can't do that in the other

200
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,440
direction if we could fit a V6 address

201
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,719
into a V4 address we probably wouldn't

202
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,820
have this problem

203
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,260
um so

204
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,200
but I still think that there's some some

205
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,839
possibilities here all right so the flow

206
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,480
kind of looks like this very similar to

207
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,019
what happens in the dns-64 flow

208
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,240
um you know you have an ipv4 only device

209
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,700
makes a DNS request it hits the CPE

210
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,660
which is the DNS server anyway

211
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,880
and so instead of forwarding that that a

212
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,060
request out to the DNS resolver it makes

213
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,519
a quad a request if it gets that quad a

214
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,060
request back or answer back then it'll

215
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,899
it can associate that with a local only

216
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:17,760
ipv4 address we can probably use you

217
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,279
know 100.64 for that and route that

218
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,500
internally

219
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,120
um so you build that Association you

220
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,459
have to save that in a state table

221
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,160
um on the CPE the CPE then replies back

222
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,500
to the endpoint

223
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,360
um with a uh with the a with a response

224
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,240
to that a request

225
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,580
um so that's that's kind of the DNS

226
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,200
portion of it

227
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,240
um then you have the NAT portion of that

228
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,019
so the host sends a uh sends that packet

229
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,440
out to the Gateway it's a CPE

230
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,779
um routes it to you know the translation

231
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,120
layer because we're already translating

232
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,560
on that CB anyway

233
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,779
and uh and so it looks up in the state

234
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,540
table what what V6 address goes along

235
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,360
with this V4 destination repackages the

236
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,580
packet sends it on its way and then

237
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,820
everything in reverse on the way back

238
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,800
um in theory this should work pretty

239
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,360
well um I've had some initial

240
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,399
conversations with uh with folks who

241
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,160
work on CPE and um they they think that

242
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,620
this is pretty possible I mean they like

243
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,440
I said the CP is already doing

244
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,420
translations anyway so this shouldn't be

245
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,279
significantly different from the

246
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,959
translations that it's already capable

247
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,380
of doing

248
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,240
um clearly we can break things

249
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,820
um we're modifying packets in Flight

250
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,220
um things things are going to break

251
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,079
um one of the big ones that we can call

252
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,899
out immediately is dnsic if you've got a

253
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,440
client that's doing DNS SEC validation

254
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,240
um you know we've modified that DNS

255
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,940
request so or the DNS response so this

256
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,160
is going to fail but

257
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,260
realistically

258
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,300
um you know these are clients that

259
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,760
aren't supporting V6 I'm pretty sure the

260
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,959
likelihood that they're going to be

261
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,579
doing DNS SEC validation is slim to none

262
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,160
um another possibility is we could have

263
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,720
some applications that might be

264
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,420
embedding literal IB addresses in in

265
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,300
their um in their responses

266
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,200
um you know some kind of custom

267
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,660
applications so maybe the client makes a

268
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,860
request out

269
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,260
um and then somewhere in uh in there

270
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,260
it's uh it can see that

271
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,720
um that it's a v V4 or V6 address and

272
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,040
it's going to say you know go make your

273
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,399
response to this other destination

274
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,540
um

275
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,180
and so if if the server sees that that's

276
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,240
coming from V6 then it might embed a V6

277
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,120
address somewhere in there

278
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,519
and uh the client obviously you know

279
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,660
because we're having this conversation

280
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,420
doesn't speak V6 at all

281
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,940
um so that's going to fail it's bad

282
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,820
practice to be embedding those uh those

283
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,459
raw IPS in uh in there anyway you should

284
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,399
probably be following DNS so hopefully

285
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,019
we won't have too many of those kinds of

286
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,820
things

287
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,579
um but you know ultimately

288
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,579
we're uh at the end of the day if we can

289
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,140
we can get some of these things

290
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,660
implemented then we need less cgn

291
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
capacity

292
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,240
so the uh you know so that that means

293
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,240
that the uh that the isps don't have to

294
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,779
have as much as much built out there we

295
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,480
can start shuffling things over and the

296
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,160
other nice really nice thing about this

297
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,459
is that it works um it kind of it fails

298
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,880
back to V4 right so if if that initial

299
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,279
DNS request never gets a quad a response

300
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,820
if it only if only an a record exists

301
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,279
then you do your regular ipv4 routing

302
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,100
your regular whatever Nat translation

303
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,920
um and then if that's being if that's

304
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,440
just a Nat four four on the CPE then

305
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,060
that takes place there and that works

306
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,160
fine

307
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,500
uh and if that happens to be you know

308
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,620
cgn you know not 444 in the uh in in the

309
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,720
provider Network or map t or whatever

310
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,420
then that also works it just it kind of

311
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,360
fails back to that uh that ipv4 path

312
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,480
um

313
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,420
it should operate very transparently

314
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,980
um to all of the customers you know

315
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,660
where there's some caveats in there that

316
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,700
uh that we talked about that you know

317
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,740
there could be some others but um but

318
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,360
generally speaking

319
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,800
um this should work you know really

320
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,220
transparently to the customer uh I would

321
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,680
expect the cost of of doing this over

322
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,959
time should be

323
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,420
um should be much less than operating a

324
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,060
much larger scaled cgn the other nice

325
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,040
thing that we can do with this is that

326
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,860
it's not dependent on the provider

327
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,880
Network

328
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,760
um so in in my network you know in att's

329
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,040
network we control all the CPS we

330
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,200
certify the software it's rcpe and we

331
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
push out all the firmware updates

332
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,579
obviously not not every provider Network

333
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,760
operates like that but this still works

334
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,120
independent of the the provider Network

335
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,820
so I would Envision a scenario where you

336
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,740
get your you know whatever router you

337
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,019
have you plug it into your isp's

338
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,360
connection and it detects

339
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,579
hey you have a V6 address available

340
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,040
would you like me to set this up to push

341
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,800
more of your traffic over to V6 uh could

342
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,040
be a very simple solution for

343
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,519
a um for a customer for an end user to

344
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,500
do they don't have to be you know one of

345
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,959
us that knows how bgp works and how all

346
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,000
of these things operate

347
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,880
um so you know what's uh what do we do

348
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,560
next

349
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,220
um

350
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,519
I think the next move here is uh is to

351
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,040
work with our CBE vendors

352
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,740
um and our partners over at different

353
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,139
um uh different manufacturers to to get

354
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,120
this functional

355
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,860
um see if it actually we can make this

356
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,240
work and uh

357
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,100
move forward from there

358
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,019
um see from the clock I actually ran

359
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,760
through these slides a lot faster than I

360
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,399
intended to

361
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,720
so we have plenty of time for questions

362
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,899
but I wanted to call out some folks that

363
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,060
that helped me a lot with uh with

364
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,980
refining some of these thoughts and

365
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,480
ideas

366
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,060
um and uh

367
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,980
that's uh

368
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,160
that's kind of the end of my idea here

369
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,760
um any questions conversation anything

370
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,019
from

371
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,620
anybody

372
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,339
Lee Howard from ipv4. Global by cocoa

373
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,540
stream Bank

374
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,180
um I can't resist talking about IPv6 at

375
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,279
any opportunity uh I think what you've

376
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,100
described is uh fairly similar to the

377
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,339
silat function in 464x lab right there's

378
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:51,660
it because you're translating from four

379
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,699
to six whether or not you're translating

380
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,060
from six to four later which is great

381
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,579
what I'm hearing from uh from isps

382
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:00,860
around the world

383
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,560
generally smaller companies is that they

384
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,680
can't deploy IPv6 or they can't save um

385
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,839
on on ipv4 addresses because they can't

386
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,420
get vendor support in the CPE whether

387
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,480
it's V6 support or 464 excellent support

388
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,920
or map T support whatever whatever

389
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,500
transition mechanism they're looking for

390
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,300
um and I've been trying to find a way to

391
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,519
to get to more of those vendors because

392
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,920
of course a lot of the CPE vendors are

393
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,199
repackaging open wrt or an equivalent

394
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,440
and the packages exist you just have to

395
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,000
you know install the package and turn on

396
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,500
the button but if you don't control the

397
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,899
CPE then you can't even get that done so

398
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,120
I I'm still you know you're right you're

399
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,380
absolutely right the next step to do

400
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,240
that would be to talk to the CPE vendors

401
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,740
and I've been having a really hard time

402
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,740
getting in front of CBE vendors

403
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,440
yeah I um thanks for the the comment

404
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,320
that's uh I think that's great I if we

405
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,300
can if some of the some of us as

406
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,820
providers that that do control the CPE

407
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,800
if we can start pushing some of these

408
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,380
things in as as standard functions then

409
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,240
uh then then I would hope that they

410
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,099
would become more available

411
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,599
um you know generally in in other

412
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,240
networks that um that that maybe aren't

413
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,220
at T

414
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,699
uh thanks uh Thomas tricks cloudflare uh

415
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,020
thanks for that talk that's really

416
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,579
interesting couple of ideas

417
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,380
um how do you see this interacting with

418
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,599
quite a few vendors

419
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,119
primarily building new features on top

420
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,720
of ipv4 and then doing IPv6 a year or

421
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,240
two years or never later when it comes

422
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
to proper carrier stuff because at that

423
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,940
point you're going to do V4 on V6 on V4

424
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,919
potentially on mpls

425
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,900
right so

426
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,740
um

427
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,140
the way the way I kind of see this

428
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,720
working it's really sort of independent

429
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,059
of what's going on out in the carrier

430
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,760
Network so whether you're doing a cgn or

431
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,220
a map t or whatever you're doing you

432
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,140
know you're kind of Distributing this uh

433
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,320
this translation layer down to the CPE

434
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,380
so it can operate you know completely

435
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,679
independently on at that level pushing

436
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,880
the traffic to to V6 you provided the

437
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,860
applications are properly you know

438
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,799
performing DNS lookups and and and using

439
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,280
you know the DNS to distribute the the

440
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,380
host names but

441
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,120
um then if there's still things that

442
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,760
that really really are only on V4 and

443
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,500
don't have the quad a records then it

444
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
just follows the regular V4 patterns so

445
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,380
I don't really see any conflict there as

446
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,440
far as I can tell but you know hoping uh

447
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,500
I I could be wrong maybe yeah

448
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,780
an additional question then how do you

449
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,660
see that interact with happy hour goals

450
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,679
um

451
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,919
so the the target for this uh this

452
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,380
transition mechanism is really for um

453
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,720
devices that don't support V6 at all

454
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,440
right so there's no happy eyeballs in

455
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,880
that uh equation I think

456
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,200
Lee Howard again I um since there's

457
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,340
nobody else at the mic I thought I'd

458
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,039
also asked you um one of your uh points

459
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,820
that was the that uh cgn May uh there

460
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,020
may be a performance difference

461
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,720
introduced by cgn if you're doing a net4

462
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,880
cgn but you're doing V6 natively and

463
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,740
that will be an incentive for other

464
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,260
folks to deploy V6 which which would be

465
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,340
great

466
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,440
my testing which is a few years old now

467
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,860
didn't hasn't seen any any measurable

468
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,720
latency through CG it was it was sub

469
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,240
millisecond so we can't count it okay um

470
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,880
have you done have you seen it no I I

471
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,919
don't have uh any any hard numbers on

472
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,020
that but you know we would hope that

473
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,360
that that would help you know just even

474
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,700
the idea of that right right that you

475
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,900
don't want your traffic to be going

476
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,940
through the cgn so you know let's uh

477
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,620
let's let's do it the other way there's

478
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,419
lots of other reasons to not like cgn

479
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,400
like if you want to do rbls or you want

480
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,260
to do geolocation or you need to do some

481
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,460
kind of reputation or other information

482
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,919
based on IP address and gee suddenly

483
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,120
you've got shared fate that's there's

484
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,100
reasons to not like that but um yeah

485
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,600
that particular one oh geez maybe you've

486
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,879
got data point yep absolutely

487
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,919
Philip Simon's Network to code

488
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,660
um I I've worked with quite a bit of

489
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,059
Enterprise environments

490
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,980
and in the Enterprise there's not a ton

491
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,299
of

492
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:18,960
um

493
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,660
like pressure business use case to

494
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,220
deploy both Stacks because then you have

495
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,200
to manage a second stack

496
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,000
um and there are security implications

497
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,679
to not wrestling with it but most

498
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,900
Enterprises just don't wrestle with it I

499
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,000
like the idea of putting back pressure

500
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,640
onto the client side to say hey use IPv6

501
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,559
because otherwise your connections are

502
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,940
going to degrade when you're going

503
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,860
through cgn instead of just going

504
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,679
directly to whatever your server is do

505
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,419
you have any other ideas at putting some

506
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,220
gentle back pressure to kind of like

507
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,740
force Enterprises to think about and

508
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,840
reconcile that and make it a valid

509
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,700
business use case where they they have

510
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,940
IPv6 yeah I mean Enterprise is uh as you

511
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,700
point out a very very different Beast

512
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,200
um you know they they can run their own

513
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,179
little Walled Garden whatever they want

514
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,620
inside

515
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,799
um and and then a lot of Enterprises you

516
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,539
know will carefully control what goes in

517
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,160
and out so

518
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,020
um you know it's a lot simpler I think

519
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,600
for an Enterprise to just you know slap

520
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,179
a proxy that is V6 enabled or you know

521
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,200
whatever their application education

522
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,559
might be on their border and they can

523
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm happy to let them do whatever they

524
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,760
want internally but clearly at some

525
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,500
point they're going to be

526
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,600
um they they there's going to be a need

527
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,780
for them to talk V6 externally

528
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,340
um which is you know kind of a different

529
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,380
problem but I I don't I'm not sure I

530
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,559
really have any any other uh ideas at

531
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,880
the moment for uh for pushing

532
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,640
Enterprises in that direction so it's a

533
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,780
tough nut to crack

534
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,980
thank you thanks

535
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,860
any anything else for anybody else on

536
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,639
the web anybody

537
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,240
great thank you very much for your time

538
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,859
