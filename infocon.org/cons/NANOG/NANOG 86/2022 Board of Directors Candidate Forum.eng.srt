professions have a professional

professional association of network

79
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,900

better at our jobs and I'm certainly a

81
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,260
better network engineer for having been

tough for a lot of reasons and you know

164
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,860
everywhere not just here in analog and

165
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,960

back in this community it became obvious

169
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,880
that there was an opportunity to bring

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,300
more of that Hands-On

171
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,539
um Vibe back to to our group here our

172
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:34,800
community

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,900
um for me it's always been a great way

174
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,360
to maintain a connection between all of

175
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,120
us and our customers and at the end of

176
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,500
the day without our customers we don't

177
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,180
you know we don't have a business right

178
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,460
uh so one of the things that I'm hopeful

179
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,280
for uh if if given the privilege to be

180
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,440
to be part of the leadership team is to

181
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,840
bring that back to nanoc very Hands-On

182
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,080
very theme based help not only raise up

183
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,259
the Next Generation or two so that it's

184
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,180
not always the same bunch of us doing

185
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,940
the talks we have new people doing that

186
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,479
but but all based in Hands-On you know

187
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,280
development of Technology that's being

188
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,800
used to you know make the internet a

189
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,160
better place for our customers thank you

190
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,660
thank you John

191
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,720
um Leslie thanks uh I'm Leslie Daigle

192
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,180
I'm the CTO of the global cyber Alliance

193
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,419
where I'm focused on working on cyber

194
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,819
security challenges at internet scale

195
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,380
I've been working with internet

196
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,660
technology development and deployment

197
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,380
for over 25 years in day jobs that were

198
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,539
both in not-for-profit context as well

199
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,060
as for-profit contexts and through the

200
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,979
course of those 25 years I've also been

201
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,199
very involved in a variety of the

202
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,599
internet institutions from Network

203
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,300
operator groups to the ietf the ieb so

204
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,220
on and so forth

205
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,440
um I'd like to continue to be on the

206
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,660
nanog board I agreed to be on the nanog

207
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,819
board as an interim appointment in June

208
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,520
and I'd like to continue because

209
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,139
um like others have said here I think

210
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,020
it's it's really important to have a

211
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,680
community uh that is vibrant and and is

212
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,720
sustainable in its efforts and the

213
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
internet does not continue to exist as

214
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,400
we know it if Network operators can't

215
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,039
come together share knowledge

216
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,280
um and and address new problems that are

217
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,800
uh that we're facing all the time

218
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,160
um in terms of background that makes me

219
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,539
useful for the board

220
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,599
um I was at IAB chair for five years in

221
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,059
that context I helped the ITF shift

222
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,559
gears in terms of its administrative

223
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,120
oversight

224
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,620
um and I've since been on the

225
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,479
administrative oversight body of that

226
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,700
organization previous experience on

227
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,019
boards and I'm out of time

228
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,399
thank you Leslie

229
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,640
um in the interest of keeping this wave

230
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,880
I will start the questions with Leslie

231
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,380
and I don't see anybody here so I'm

232
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,600
going to go with the first question from

233
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,980
the committee

234
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,380
um and if you'd like me to repeat it as

235
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,000
we go through I'm happy to just let me

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,019
know

237
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,180
um can you elaborate on the experience

238
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,980
and skill sets that you possess that

239
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,380
would make you a more success make help

240
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,080
you make nanog more successful I realize

241
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,839
you just said that but well I'm happy to

242
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,540
delve in a little bit further so I think

243
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,820
there are two key areas I'd like to

244
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,940
focus on one is experience and having

245
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,860
been both in the executive of

246
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,899
not-for-profits and Reporting two boards

247
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,240
and previous board experiences I

248
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,800
described so I've got a pretty good

249
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,660
sense about what kinds of things does

250
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,160
the organization need to be able to

251
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,959
communicate to the board in order to

252
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,540
demonstrate what the plan is and what a

253
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,279
board needs to do in order to say yeah

254
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,080
that looks like a reasonably strategic

255
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,260
plan let's do it so that balance of what

256
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,540
is the board rule versus what is a staff

257
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,760
role the other side that I'd like to

258
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,480
emphasize is getting projects done

259
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,060
um there have been a number of times in

260
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,160
in my career where we've been faced with

261
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,019
challenges that we've been told yet

262
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,000
that's just not possible

263
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,820
um and prove that wrong so I was the

264
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,560
chief internet technology officer at the

265
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,019
internet society when it hosted the

266
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,920
World ibv6 day in World IPv6 launch

267
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,720
um and I'm happy to bore anybody with

268
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,779
Tails from that era offline

269
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,700
um and and you know it was really a

270
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,260
question of how do we bring the

271
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,120
community together to solve the

272
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,920
community's problem and the internet

273
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Society was there to facilitate

274
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
um so I think that both of those both of

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,640
those vectors are important

276
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,620
understanding the relationship and not

277
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,899
being afraid of large problems not being

278
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,880
afraid of change and and working

279
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,700
together to find practical solutions to

280
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,440
move forward

281
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,300
thank you

282
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,519
uh John same question would you like me

283
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,279
to read back it thank you so much so you

284
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,360
know I'll take a slightly different

285
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,940
approach you know when it comes to at

286
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,500
the at the board level we have to be

287
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,980
able to identify where the puck is going

288
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,720
but that's not enough right you have to

289
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,200
be able to understand and and very

290
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,060
clearly Define what the path to getting

291
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,500
to that to where that clock's going to

292
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,740
be right so again you know going back to

293
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,480
the to the opening comments around you

294
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,740
know Hands-On

295
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,079
having the experience that we you know

296
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,060
that we've all listed as in our

297
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,160
backgrounds here and and helping this

298
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,380
organization identify where the puck is

299
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,480
going to be going for us as a as an

300
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,279
organization as a community and really

301
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,660
have an experience from a Hands-On point

302
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,880
of view to bring that here side by side

303
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
shoulder to shoulder with not just a

304
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,560
leadership team but the community so you

305
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,180
know working together in a hackathon

306
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,920
environment right to make sure that you

307
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,779
know directionally not not just from an

308
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:43,980
organizational perspective but a

309
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,140
technology perspective that we're we're

310
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,640
kind of cultivating those discussions

311
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,440
here and the Hands-On skill sets to make

312
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,700
sure that everybody can be successful

313
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,000
thank you I'm going to repeat it can you

314
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,620
elaborate on the experiences and skill

315
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,060
sets that you possess that would help

316
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,700
make nanog more successful Michael

317
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,060
so as uh as a leader and as a human

318
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,860
being I try to uh I try to embrace

319
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,440
empathy as much as possible and I really

320
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,980
rely on relationship building as

321
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,300
foundational to to uh to to

322
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,660
any organization or to any relationship

323
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,140
um I realized that I'm up here

324
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,180
advocating for myself but you know

325
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,720
effectively I would be one of uh six

326
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,940
voting members of the board uh plus the

327
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,000
the uh the executive director and so

328
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,560
relation being able to build

329
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,240
relationships with the other board

330
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,339
members is is something that I would

331
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,880
take as uh uh a primary goal as well as

332
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,440
in building relationships with the

333
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,000
various people within the organization

334
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
to figure out what it is that the the

335
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,459
community uh wants and what the

336
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,920
community really really needs

337
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,420
um the other part of that is I uh you

338
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,120
know even though I've I've been touching

339
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,100
technology less over time uh I'm still

340
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,079
fairly deeply involved in it and I think

341
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,200
I possess a technological skill set that

342
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,040
uh is what I uh perceive as still

343
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,339
somewhat uncommon within nanog and

344
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:24,899
that's uh software development and

345
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,320
Automation and I'd like to be able to to

346
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,540
use the knowledge in the space to

347
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,800
encourage the the community to uh and to

348
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,860
continue to uh to educate and talk on

349
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,480
more traditional networking Concepts

350
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,700
which I think are foundational but also

351
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,399
bring in uh in more newer Technologies

352
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,740
to really make sure that that uh that

353
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,240
the community that we're we're educating

354
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,519
and supporting uh is relevant in the

355
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,339
current and future job market

356
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:54,720
thank you Michael

357
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,000
uh lee would you like a repeat that's

358
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,519
all right thank you the um I've heard it

359
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,079
a few times now

360
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,639
um well I don't think we're trying to

361
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,160
hire a network engineer or even a

362
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,660
software developer we're trying to find

363
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,519
a board member but it's good to have

364
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,560
those skills right we need we we are we

365
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,420
want people who understand how to

366
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,180
interact with the community and uh and

367
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,760
know what we've all been through

368
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
um I've worked at large isps Time Warner

369
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,160
Cable unit I've worked at small isps you

370
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,540
wouldn't recognize the names I've worked

371
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,220
in I've worked in uh corporate

372
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,779
Enterprise I.T I've been an entrepreneur

373
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,000
I've built my own stuff I've done a lot

374
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,200
of different things I've got lots of

375
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
different kinds of experience when I was

376
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,160
on the Aaron board I was this treasurer

377
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,779
for a while I was the secretary for a

378
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,540
while so I've done those that that kind

379
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,360
of of work uh I think that what would

380
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,000
you need to be looking for I would hope

381
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,399
would be to build the right team you

382
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,199
when trying to build a board it's a

383
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,540
committee if you needed if you're trying

384
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,160
to build that committee you don't want

385
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,620
six people who all think exactly the

386
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,060
same because they're all think exactly

387
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,079
the same you might as well have one

388
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,000
person so try to put together the team

389
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,440
that is going to have complementary

390
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,839
perspectives and skill sets uh and so

391
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
that's that's sort of what I'd be

392
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,800
looking for the team to uh for the

393
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,019
community to be considering when uh when

394
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,540
making selections I also

395
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,399
um when I was on the Aaron board which

396
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,560
was I think the most direct directly

397
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,600
comparable experience uh I thought of

398
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,579
myself as being the the approachable

399
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,199
board member I was the one that the

400
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,399
community would go to and say hey

401
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,019
there's this weird thing can you sort of

402
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,880
find out what's going on or bring it up

403
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,180
and so that's part of what I like about

404
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,339
this community as well is I can always

405
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,199
talk to everybody and I was just talking

406
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,699
to somebody today who said it's amazing

407
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,440
how open people are here everybody's

408
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,940
willing to talk to you well of course

409
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,079
like what's the point of having an

410
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,579
organization like this we don't if we

411
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,740
aren't that way if we don't have that

412
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,940
thank you

413
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,500
thank you Lee

414
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,420
um Alex can we hear from you

415
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,560
yeah

416
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,420
uh thankfully you stole a lot of my

417
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,820
thunder excellent

418
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,519
it's all about cooperations building

419
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,880
across a broad spectrum I have

420
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,440
been the board member and a founding

421
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,820
board member of two nog groups I brought

422
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,100
technology to life for the last 40 years

423
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,040
as both a low level manager senior

424
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,860
manager and technologist I prefer being

425
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,040
a technologist right now but it's a

426
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,660
flippable role

427
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,579
uh

428
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,180
in the past 40 years I've

429
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,920
done community service

430
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,899
built boards

431
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:33,120
had lots of fun with non-profits ranging

432
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,500
from a 10-person amateur radio group to

433
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,459
the 15 000 people in the blank Sports

434
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,860
community that I was heavily involved in

435
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,120
uh

436
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,459
I think that I have a good background

437
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,740
cross with working with people being

438
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,600
open being able to synthesize what

439
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,000
people want after they give me a list

440
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,300
and then go back and say hey team this

441
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,339
is what we've been told this is what I

442
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,980
think it is what do you think it is can

443
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,540
we work together come up with something

444
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,400
that will move the entire organization

445
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,760
forward

446
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,679
thank you

447
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,380
um that's a series of very unique and

448
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,160
sincere uh responses I appreciate that

449
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,079
um I'm going to change up the order a

450
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
little bit

451
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,740
hello

452
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,720
Steve yeah

453
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,919
um

454
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,500
I was wondering and maybe if I could put

455
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,320
a Twist on it if folks could maybe

456
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,299
describe what they see as being the key

457
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,900
challenges for nanog over what would be

458
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,360
their board term and what the like kind

459
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,220
of like what would be the Legacy you'd

460
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,919
like to leave with your term without

461
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,000
using the words technology

462
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,059
or engineer

463
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,919
okay

464
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,039
just to clarify the question this is

465
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,660
legacy of their tenure Legacy if they

466
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,039
were on the board if you were on the

467
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,140
board like what do you see as being the

468
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,460
problems that you would like to address

469
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,039
and what would be the like if if you

470
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,480
were to leave

471
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,700
and be like pleased with your time on

472
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,220
the board what would you like what would

473
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,020
that look like and don't use the words

474
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,240
technology or engineer

475
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,299
is the question for the entire panel

476
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,240
whoever you know wants to all right use

477
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,679
those words

478
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,080
um let's let's start with Lee

479
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
if you'd like to answer that question

480
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,559
I'd love to answer that question so

481
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,080
there's the the biggest immediate hurdle

482
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,120
is really recovering the finances from

483
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,679
the pandemic that was clear from the

484
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,539
members meeting today uh it looks like

485
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:40,740
we're on the right track right path

486
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,940
there but that's got to be part of what

487
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,740
we pay attention to and I've had

488
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,880
thoughts about that and I've talked to

489
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,080
some members of the board already about

490
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,580
some other things that we can do in

491
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,220
order to maybe improve the the financial

492
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,080
relationships uh the financial

493
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,380
structures uh the revenues uh so that's

494
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,900
that's one part that I think is an

495
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,940
immediate hurdle the Strategic plan is

496
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,919
actually ending like the the street the

497
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,740
21 2021 plus strategic plan um it kind

498
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,500
of only goes up to early next years I

499
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
recall so developing a new plan there

500
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,860
what I'm excited for is the is building

501
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,919
on the uh education I think the the

502
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,860
biggest structural problem that nanog

503
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,280
has is uh the amount of gray hair

504
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,480
that we have uh we have right where

505
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,919
um I even use that term metaphorically

506
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,039
because minus I have my own Grace

507
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,039
um but we have uh I'm concerned about

508
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,320
the Next Generation that we seem to have

509
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,360
many people of a certain demographic and

510
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,160
we need to make sure that we are

511
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,580
preparing uh future uh people in the

512
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,020
profession I mean you're not using the

513
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,919
word

514
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,419
um perjury people in the profession to

515
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,400
be able to participate and even just

516
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,039
start with understanding what most of

517
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,900
our talks are even about I don't know

518
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,980
how many people remember their first

519
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,600
nanog and going

520
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,580
I I don't even understand what that

521
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,500
means what how did I and then you

522
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,640
participate for a while you read the

523
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,799
mailing list and suddenly after a while

524
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,840
you go oh I'm starting to get it maybe I

525
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,860
understand how to do this stuff now

526
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,840
thank you Lee

527
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,700
um I'm happy to take that too if you

528
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,720
want

529
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,860
would you like to take that question

530
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,740
next I'll take a bite at it um I I think

531
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,780
I'd like to just start by saying you

532
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,580
said Legacy and I'm I'm just going to

533
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,679
say in three or six years from now where

534
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,020
should nanog be and and I think that

535
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,059
we're nanog should be in three to six

536
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,760
years is Diversified from income just

537
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,640
from meetings so in order to be a

538
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,160
sustainable and Vibrant Community going

539
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,500
forward I think it has to broaden its

540
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,900
scope of activities and its scope of

541
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,640
Revenue as you you know heard Edward

542
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,679
talk about at the member meeting this

543
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,820
morning

544
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,559
um so that's what I would like to see

545
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,900
have happened by the end of three to six

546
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,880
years I don't think it would be my role

547
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,280
to make that happen it'd be my role to

548
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,620
be part of the team that is you know

549
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,600
working with Edward to see what what the

550
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,000
options are but I think that's the key

551
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,500
challenge is sustainability and

552
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,080
relevance to continue to be the Vibrant

553
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,960
Community of network operators

554
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,460
thank you

555
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,620
um Alex Michael John absolutely I'd love

556
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,780
to okay I'll be brief I couldn't agree

557
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,120
more and I think if I could be very

558
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,860
succinct in the response I mean I think

559
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,059
a

560
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,080
more deeply integrated plan

561
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,799
across all the facets of nadog

562
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,960
basically at the very top of it the most

563
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,799
important thing is going to be our

564
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,380
ability to prioritize focus and execute

565
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,080
right so you know not suggesting that

566
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,340
that's not the case today but as you

567
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,020
introduce change and deeper integration

568
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,120
it is imperative to be able to stay

569
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,700
focused focused on on the mission and

570
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,840
deliver right I mean if there's one

571
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
thing that I think anybody who knows me

572
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,120
in the room

573
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,860
you know for however long you've known

574
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,120
me if there's one thing that I'm very

575
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,340
proud of as far as what I bring to the

576
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,039
table is is to get things done right is

577
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,240
to stay focused and deliver

578
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,280
thank you Alex uh we we have some

579
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,980
questions from the online group on I'm

580
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,900
not sure if you will right here look at

581
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,520
me no

582
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,780
I have some questions from the online

583
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,900
group uh who want to do those uh I'm

584
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,700
gonna allow the panel to answer the

585
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,460
current question okay and then I will I

586
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,320
can take that one

587
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,460
thank you

588
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,659
the Legacy I would like to leave is one

589
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,600
that stretches back

590
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,740
so that we have a diverse group that

591
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,320
will outlive me and come to say my

592
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,000
eulogy

593
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,059
when we have

594
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,179
broken down the barriers to entering the

595
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:43,200
profession

596
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,299
broken down the barriers that are

597
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,900
perceived to get into nanog and working

598
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,659
with the organization

599
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,360
um yes I am a graveyard I've been around

600
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,059
I think that my experience

601
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,640
is useful at that point because I have

602
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,820
seen other organizations fail because

603
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,159
they don't bring in enough New Blood

604
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,260
I would like to bring in new blood with

605
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,260
a broader perspective

606
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,260
de-emphasizing our conferences

607
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,240
emphasizing Outreach and education

608
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,940
and as everyone else has said leave us

609
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,799
in a solid financial situation going

610
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,780
forward

611
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,980
thank you uh Michael to add to that sure

612
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,840
uh many of the things that I would say

613
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,000
have already been said so I won't repeat

614
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,820
them uh especially the uh the financial

615
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,059
pieces and as we said uh relevancy which

616
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,919
I think was a good substitute for the

617
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,220
two verboten words in this exercise

618
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,940
um the the one thing that I'll add which

619
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,679
I think is also similar to what Alex had

620
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,559
said is this idea of of inclusivity so

621
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:54,240
my first nanog was nanog27 which was in

622
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,280
2003 in Phoenix uh I was a little like

623
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,760
still like green network engineer uh

624
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,059
with a little ISP

625
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:07,380
as3737 that nobody had ever heard of on

626
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,720
my name badge and nobody wanted to talk

627
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,980
to me

628
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,280
um fast forward a

629
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,059
fast forward 13 years and I was I had

630
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,700
Netflix on my on my badge and everyone

631
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,820
wanted to talk to me uh and having

632
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,460
experienced both of those things uh it

633
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,100
feels way better to have everybody want

634
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,539
to talk to you than no one want to talk

635
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:31,860
to you

636
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,700
um so making a a Kinder uh more

637
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,860
inclusive organization is is something

638
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,960
that I would I'd love to be able to have

639
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,960
some part in leaving behind

640
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,000
thank you

641
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
um I will take the online question after

642
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,799
the gentleman that's been standing for

643
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,299
about 10 minutes

644
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,400
you can do you do that online all right

645
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,039
I'll defer thank you uh what was the

646
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,600
online question this comes from Matthew

647
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,299
pitoc uh one challenge our industry has

648
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,740
continued to face

649
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,539
is that we're a bunch of Aging white

650
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,299
males candidates what will be your

651
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,520
approach to help increase diversity at

652
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,539
nanog

653
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,400
if you've worked on the challenge and

654
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,860
other roles please give examples of

655
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,919
successes you've achieved

656
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,179
thank you Matt

657
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,779
uh Michael did you capture that for this

658
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:28,799
goes back to uh I I feel uh a theme uh

659
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,500
being built here so one of the ways that

660
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,020
we can bring that in is through a number

661
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,640
of initiatives that are already in place

662
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,220
like the um the nanog college immersion

663
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,980
program we're reaching out to uh to

664
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,140
historically uh black colleges in in

665
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,600
universities uh there are other ways

666
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,480
that we can reach out to other very

667
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,460
underserved groups I was talking to

668
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,919
Scott earlier where we were discussing

669
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,919
uh reaching out to military uh

670
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,659
communities or veteran communities as

671
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,240
well as communities of uh formerly

672
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,220
incarcerated people

673
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,900
um things like the hackathon is

674
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,620
something that is bringing in New Blood

675
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,799
uh in every single event uh I've like I

676
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,279
would love to see the hackathon uh uh

677
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,140
it's it's not at all an intimidating

678
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,419
group but I'd like to see it even less

679
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:20,400
intimidating and bringing in in more

680
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,700
people featuring it

681
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,020
more visibly within the within the

682
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,120
conference so there's it's basically

683
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,279
like take many of the initiatives that

684
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,440
are that are uh that we're doing now

685
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,419
double down on them and and continue to

686
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,919
add

687
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,700
thank you uh John or Leslie

688
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,720
sure

689
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,000
um I think that the key thing there is

690
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,980
to actually make sure that the diversity

691
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,779
programs that are under discussion now

692
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:48,539
are properly supported and fleshed out

693
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,840
and made concrete I think that ensuring

694
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,700
that there is more engagement of people

695
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,039
of different ages sizes shapes and

696
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,299
colors

697
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,000
um is is not something that is done

698
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,440
lightly

699
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,539
um so I would I would really like to see

700
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,279
this done through the program to ensure

701
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,020
that everybody's good ideas are funneled

702
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,120
into the process so I don't know how

703
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,100
much diversity I personally could bring

704
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,679
to nanog but um I would certainly like

705
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,140
see support for programs that can do

706
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,880
that

707
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,799
thank you Leslie

708
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,200
could I comment John by all means so

709
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,600
I'll again being brief I think it boils

710
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,640
down to so you know I've worked with and

711
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,960
for a lot of different people over the

712
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,240
years and some make the mistake that

713
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,460
you're you know you're just born knowing

714
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,520
everything just simply not true right

715
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,799
um and I think the onus is on us and

716
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,539
thanks to Matt for the question to

717
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:42,240
invest the time as early as possible no

718
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,400
matter where you come from to make sure

719
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,539
that you have all the right tools to be

720
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,340
successful I've seen a lot of people set

721
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,539
up for failure

722
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,340
yeah because yeah they were put into

723
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,720
situations they weren't they were just

724
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,279
simply not prepared for it's not fair to

725
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,840
them right and it's ultimately it's not

726
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,400
fair to to the people that they serve

727
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,960
right whether it's a customer or a

728
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,880
community like nanog so I think I think

729
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,559
it starts with a lot of what what

730
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,360
everybody's already said here but it

731
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,220
really accommodates in an investment in

732
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,000
time

733
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,860
transferring our experience our

734
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,779
knowledge shoulder to shoulder side by

735
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:11,880
side yeah like we said here a second ago

736
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,919
about the hackathon what a what an

737
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,840
amazing you know opportunity to really

738
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,720
do that side by side with people

739
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,779
thank you John I believe Alex oh I'd

740
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,299
like to Chairman one

741
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,600
thing I have there's a really important

742
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,360
thought is I agree when I first started

743
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,659
coming to nanog I worked for a very

744
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:36,900
small ISP but fortunately through other

745
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,000
venues I had met a lot of people who

746
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,919
were involved in the community so I

747
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,620
didn't have the fish in water that

748
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,659
Michael started with

749
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:46,340
um

750
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,159
we very very heavily emphasize

751
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,279
technology and technologists

752
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,140
and part of what I would like to do is

753
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,620
spread the wealth a bit as it were so

754
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,080
that we include people who want to be

755
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,900
people managers of technologists so that

756
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,840
they know what they're doing

757
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,220
involve the people in marketing so they

758
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,919
can tell an honest story

759
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:11,700
um

760
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,279
as opposed to Pie in the Sky which will

761
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,620
never happen because they will learn

762
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,140
that the technologists will see through

763
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,179
a bill of smoke and mirrors

764
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,279
thank you Lee I'm going to try to be

765
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,140
quick in response specifically to what

766
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,179
Matt was asking about what have we done

767
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,640
towards diversity I do think and I

768
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,460
thought very carefully about before

769
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,799
running I'm another old white guy is

770
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,480
that that's you know is that really the

771
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,880
strength that the organization needs

772
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,960
most of the people if they look back in

773
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,279
my career most of the people that I

774
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,620
promoted have been women

775
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,260
um many I don't know a percentage of

776
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,200
people of color but certainly I've hired

777
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,940
many people of color I'm specifically we

778
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,159
I was at the hackathon at the I think it

779
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,320
was the last nanog and uh some folks

780
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,059
from Howard University were there and so

781
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,520
what have I done to promote diversity I

782
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,080
offer them jobs

783
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,279
um I'm specifically trying to be

784
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,320
inclusive and create opportunities uh in

785
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,460
those cases

786
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,840
um and I speak three languages so I'm

787
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,539
pretty good cross culture

788
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,659
thank you Lee and uh thank you Matt ptak

789
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,620
for that wonderful question miss you

790
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,659
um let me take a question from the

791
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,200
audience

792
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,640
Jared March from Akamai uh I think

793
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,220
pretty much all of you know me and such

794
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,399
uh you know who are on the panel so

795
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,460
something I've been observing and I mean

796
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,980
we've made an interesting somewhat

797
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,640
pointed reference to this is

798
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,860
as nanog has

799
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,299
evolved

800
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,360
uh over the many many years

801
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,760
you know and Lee you kind of pointed to

802
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,460
is this a Professional Organization you

803
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,100
know we used to have you know this a bit

804
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,899
of Counter Culture stuff that existed

805
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,000
here the original t-shirts in the

806
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,520
original nanog logo had a tie on it

807
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,559
which was a reference back to the people

808
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,360
who's like oh well you guys can't be

809
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,700
professionals if you're not wearing ties

810
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,760
and and such there and as we're seeing

811
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,399
this increased professionalization of

812
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,860
this community uh of professionally

813
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,679
produced videos uh that show up for the

814
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,539
conference whereas as opposed to I think

815
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:22,860
some of the more amateur stuff but the

816
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,380
amateur stuff went online a lot quicker

817
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,179
and the content was more readily

818
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,520
available to the people uh in those days

819
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,700
we've continued to see this push towards

820
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,520
more of a structured membership model

821
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,159
that has made it I think

822
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,380
things actually seem a lot further Out

823
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,059
Of Reach as the fees to attend the

824
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,460
meetings have gone up and such are there

825
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,380
activities that we're engaging in today

826
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,960
either at the you know potentially a

827
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,059
hypothetical future nanog certification

828
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,000
of Engineers or something or all of

829
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,760
these other you know I I see Alex cringe

830
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,020
which is you know an appropriate

831
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,960
response I believe personally but um you

832
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,220
know are there activities that we're

833
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,840
doing where you know when we're talking

834
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,179
about you know the financial challenges

835
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:07,679
that we have that we should be thinking

836
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,360
actually about you know sort of

837
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,520
narrowing or better focusing

838
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,679
um and you know my question is part

839
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,360
towards Lee on the you know because he

840
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,700
was kind of leaning towards you know the

841
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,260
hypothetical certification or that's

842
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,059
what I heard

843
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,760
um and just you know just from others

844
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,559
you know I'd be curious to hear what

845
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,120
your your thoughts are on things like

846
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,679
are we spending the money in the right

847
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,260
places on the right things you know with

848
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,000
the resources that we have available to

849
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,320
us because I think we have a lot of

850
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,899
resources that are available to us

851
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:38,940
um and then how we're choosing to spend

852
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,100
that money I I sometimes question

853
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,659
whether or not that's the wisest thing

854
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,760
that I'm getting fancy marketing emails

855
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,460
and I still have never seen a membership

856
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,559
email I don't know it might be hitting

857
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,020
my it's in HTML so it went in the spam

858
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,320
folder filter because it's no longer in

859
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,240
text and like we have a lot of these

860
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,860
excessive like which creates an

861
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,020
accessibility problem as well so I'm

862
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,520
seeing the community kind of push

863
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,399
further away from the original roots and

864
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,320
I think when it comes to code of

865
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,659
conducted stuff absolutely that stuff is

866
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,760
great that we've improved I think a lot

867
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,679
on that culture but when you're pushing

868
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,720
away you know a lot of those other those

869
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,460
other things like the accessibility of

870
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,659
the community and such I think it makes

871
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,940
it a lot harder and like I said it feels

872
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,340
like we're edging more towards as Lee

873
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,080
said like a professional organization

874
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,240
where we're going to be nanog certified

875
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,760
engineers and official nanog members and

876
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,860
that's going to mean something somewhere

877
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,899
to something to somebody in a hiring

878
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:37,380
process or the same way a j and cie or

879
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,500
ccie

880
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,240
and an ie right that was a fantastically

881
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,000
long question thank you Jared I don't

882
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,679
even know how to condense that right now

883
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,720
I'm going to try and condense it because

884
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,700
I think it was partly pointed towards me

885
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,080
um but I don't want to Monopoly if I may

886
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,419
by all means so so are we slouching

887
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:55,740
towards suits

888
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,179
right that's that's kind of where I hear

889
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:58,860
what I'm what what the what is what I

890
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,360
call the professional

891
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,519
right well so I got I put on a jacket so

892
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:03,840
I'd have some place to pin the mic and

893
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,919
it turns out they pinned it to the shirt

894
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,240
so it turns out it wasn't necessary at

895
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,559
all

896
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,379
um the the and what I was not thinking

897
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,199
of of continuing education units or your

898
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,540
CEUs or or specifically professional

899
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,580
developments kind of uh training or

900
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,780
certification that's that's not really

901
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,580
where I was going what I was thinking

902
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,560
was that

903
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,080
um right now nanog is and historically

904
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,679
has been like for Network operators who

905
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,839
speak bgp I mean that was kind of like

906
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,820
what kind of networks was kind of the

907
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,899
way I was looking I've been looking at

908
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,480
it there are lots of networks that are

909
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,399
some very large but stubby networks and

910
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,619
there they don't come here

911
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,179
um I'd like to show I was thinking about

912
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,699
how do we get other kinds of people who

913
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,500
are interested in the work in network

914
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,679
engineering as a as as work yeah I love

915
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,960
watching packets I love seeing how

916
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,399
things connect together and that's why I

917
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,200
was excited about doing this kind of

918
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,280
work

919
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,720
um people who are excited about that

920
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,480
it's hard to to get started on that path

921
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,980
and so that's where that's what I was

922
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,780
talking about of of developing the the

923
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,760
educational resources to help people get

924
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,440
to where they can get excited about some

925
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,240
of the uh the talks that we sort of are

926
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,980
used to seeing

927
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,079
um I also but I do think of it as being

928
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,540
we get together and help each other get

929
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,579
better at networking right that's that

930
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:21,720
that's what I was really talking about

931
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,700
is that's that's kind of what we're for

932
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,400
is to make help each other make each

933
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,260
other's part of the internet work better

934
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,760
thank you that's what I'm trying to get

935
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,980
sorry thank you don't apologize it's

936
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,560
cohesive thank you

937
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,200
um Leslie uh sure thanks would you like

938
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,619
to yeah bottled Jared's brand yeah well

939
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,240
I want to say first of all I think that

940
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,859
Hands-On means something different to

941
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:48,599
somebody who's actually literally built

942
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,339
his own ISP

943
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,260
um so I'm I'm not sure that this whole

944
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,119
group is going to get as Hands-On as

945
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,740
Jared has been

946
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,300
um but the

947
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,339
I think the important thing for me is

948
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,320
that this this remain a community I said

949
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,300
that earlier and I mean it right I think

950
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,579
when we are provide an environment where

951
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,440
people can come and say hey there's this

952
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,520
thing and we should all be thinking

953
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,680
about this thing for instance the last

954
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,660
presentation we saw in this room before

955
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,119
this session right where uh Kristoff was

956
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,520
talking about the uh buffer bloating

957
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,740
issue and what to do about it

958
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,099
um the how to get there from here or how

959
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,420
we evolve

960
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,940
um I think that there is a real need

961
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,400
to be careful about how we embark on new

962
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,480
projects

963
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,280
and that is something that I think I can

964
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,440
help bring to the board as an oversight

965
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,480
role

966
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,339
we are talking about doing things other

967
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,839
than the thing that nanog has always

968
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,000
done namely meetings

969
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,859
um and it actually takes some careful

970
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:47,940
skill and and tactics to explore new

971
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,400
strategies and make them you know test

972
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,079
the waters and figure out what will work

973
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,180
what will actually move the community in

974
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,619
the direction it needs to go versus

975
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,060
things that are going to be expensive

976
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,300
flops so I don't have an answer but I'm

977
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,880
certainly keenly aware of the challenge

978
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,920
and I think that my experience in having

979
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,680
spent most of my career working on

980
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,599
trying you know new things or things

981
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,060
people said could not be done suggested

982
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,560
I have a couple of things to bring to

983
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,720
that particular table

984
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,119
thank you Leslie

985
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,680
um

986
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,119
John

987
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,820
so there is this guy in Michigan or

988
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,880
somewhere that built his own ISP I I

989
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,920
find myself asking if there was a

990
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,660
certification for that

991
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,300
I think I know the answer it's no

992
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,339
I wonder how much of that was learned

993
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,920
partially here right you know back in

994
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,160
the day right and I look around you know

995
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,720
many of us here are have been involved

996
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,160
in many other organizations you know

997
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,800
ietf you know Aaron you know the list

998
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,480
goes on one of the things that worries

999
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,400
me is

1000
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,920
the distance that is being

1001
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,619
increased between us and

1002
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,200
operationalization right

1003
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,480
um you know many of us were born from it

1004
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,000
you know a lot of gray hair and

1005
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,579
shortened lives from it right but it

1006
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,040
doesn't have to be a minority meaning a

1007
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,599
small number of people it should be the

1008
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,099
majority right in order to make your

1009
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,839
dreams a reality whether it's you know

1010
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,940
technology or otherwise you have to you

1011
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,320
have to you have to know how to get it

1012
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,040
from idea to delivery right and jar is a

1013
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,079
great example right I mean end to end

1014
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,339
remarkable

1015
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:25,079
like so impressed with that work right

1016
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,300
and I think that's a great example of

1017
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,020
what we need to increase here within our

1018
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,480
community right and like Leslie

1019
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,760
describes having deliberate explicit

1020
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,619
plans to be able to make sure that

1021
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,359
everybody can be everybody in this

1022
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,579
community can benefit from

1023
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,300
that experience

1024
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,280
valid point I have personally walked

1025
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,000
some of his route miles it's muddy

1026
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,720
uh Michael uh I really liked Jared's

1027
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,800
long rambling question uh because all of

1028
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,140
the ones previous to it were along the

1029
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,780
lines of like good things are good and

1030
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,680
yours is the first one that is uh it

1031
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,200
gets into gray areas and nuance and and

1032
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,380
trade-offs and people now have to assert

1033
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,940
something

1034
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,480
um and so there's there's tension in uh

1035
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,760
are we spending money in the in the

1036
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,680
right places uh and I I don't have an

1037
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,740
answer to that uh other than it's

1038
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,839
definitely something that I believe the

1039
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:32,880
current board is doing and I hope to do

1040
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,280
on the on a future one or on the feature

1041
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,300
one

1042
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,119
um but the the other one is like are we

1043
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,800
moving away from our roots and that

1044
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,859
seems uh definitely in tension with are

1045
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,540
we attracting the next generation of

1046
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,280
network engineers

1047
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,900
and so

1048
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,760
I

1049
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,359
I so I'll I'll take a stance and say We

1050
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:58,980
There is there's certainly operational

1051
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,020
realities that I I think are going to be

1052
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,260
incumbent for uh for a lot of people who

1053
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,740
who are educated here uh to take on but

1054
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,359
to

1055
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,599
uh to not send out uh HTML formatted

1056
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,320
messages into uh to forego things like

1057
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,359
discourse or Discord or slack for

1058
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,980
communication as opposed to the nanog

1059
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,320
mailing list I I think we're we're

1060
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,060
shooting ourselves in the foot as far as

1061
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,820
being able to attract new people in so I

1062
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,000
I think these changes uh not only are

1063
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,859
inevitable but are are positive

1064
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,780
thank you Michael

1065
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,520
Alex

1066
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,119
Jared called me out yes I did cringe on

1067
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,880
the thought of a nanog certification

1068
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,280
although I will say personally I would

1069
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,040
love it if there was some independent

1070
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,300
group that did do a network

1071
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,339
certification that wasn't attached to a

1072
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:59,460
vendor but that's me

1073
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,000
um

1074
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,300
I agree with Michael that we need to

1075
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,640
move on Beyond

1076
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,540
plain text email Slack

1077
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,540
we did text messaging for the light uh

1078
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,040
you can talk people

1079
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,359
um

1080
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,520
it's what the younger generation want

1081
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,740
and what we need is the younger

1082
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,220
generation

1083
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,359
I think we're going down the right path

1084
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,119
now with the university with the

1085
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,160
Outreach

1086
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,140
I'll just recap what I said before I

1087
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,260
think we really do need to de-emphasize

1088
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,260
the get together three times a year

1089
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,680
because that's the bill and end-all

1090
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,260
we need to keep it but we need to expand

1091
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,640
past it I think we're on the right

1092
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,020
trajectory

1093
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,599
uh are we going far enough down the

1094
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,660
right trajectory is the question

1095
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,839
I would hope that I have the ability to

1096
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:58,859
work with the team to increase it

1097
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:00,780
um I don't want to use the words that we

1098
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,900
used about inclusivity

1099
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,300
um because we should just be this

1100
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,880
massive blob of everyone

1101
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,040
I would also like to disclaim the fact

1102
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,599
that I think Jared did an awesome job

1103
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,800
with building the Washington telephone

1104
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,560
company and putting up his presentation

1105
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,859
which just showed what deterministic

1106
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:26,060
gumption can do

1107
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,720
thank you Alex

1108
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,380
um

1109
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,440
I see a very common theme in in the in

1110
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,920
all these answers so far is is just new

1111
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,160
blood new members a younger generation

1112
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,339
and uh for the the sentiment is very

1113
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:45,780
mutual

1114
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,579
um let me go to another question from

1115
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,260
the crowd with from the gentleman with

1116
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,780
the amazing Sports code awesome isn't it

1117
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,540
uh incredible Gerard was like people in

1118
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,339
suits

1119
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,980
so sorry Warren Kamari Google this

1120
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,300
question is actually going to be kind of

1121
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,780
similar to Jared's maybe a bit shorter

1122
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,480
um as John pointed out a lot of us were

1123
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,339
sort of educated here at Nanook right

1124
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:10,260
like Jared as an example

1125
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,720
we came here we learned a bunch of Stuff

1126
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,920
Etc

1127
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,480
there's also been a Common Thread about

1128
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,700
we need newcomers

1129
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,760
I'm concerned that we have moved away

1130
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,220
from educating people

1131
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,260
and it's become much more sort of a

1132
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,180
trade show and newcomers aren't really

1133
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,099
going to want to come along and watch a

1134
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:30,720
trade show because they're not really

1135
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,000
getting educated

1136
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,160
um yep a bunch of the candidates also

1137
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,480
said you know we should have more

1138
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,000
Hands-On and more tutorial things

1139
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,220
the thing is we heard that the last time

1140
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,540
there was a board election and we've

1141
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,040
heard it for quite a while you know

1142
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,359
there should be more Hands-On more

1143
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,400
educational Stuff Etc

1144
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,099
how do we get from where we are now to

1145
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,420
actually having

1146
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,880
people come along and as Lee said you

1147
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,460
know learn about bgp like nanoga

1148
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,140
shouldn't just all be bgp operators it

1149
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,880
should be other people as well

1150
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,740
but you do need some of them who speak

1151
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,140
bgp and you need the other folk as well

1152
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,839
I don't really see them coming here and

1153
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,480
learning stuff because I don't see us

1154
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,720
teaching much we have large companies

1155
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,400
stand up and make presentations about

1156
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,920
how great their network is you know here

1157
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,780
we're in 4 000 different locations come

1158
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,760
here with us and then they sit down

1159
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,099
where's the like type this then click

1160
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,740
that and the network goes boom

1161
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,720
can I make a quick comment for the

1162
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,760
program committee about the uh we need

1163
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,619
more education we didn't have a

1164
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,119
tutorials and tracks room this year due

1165
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,280
to budget cuts we will have a tutorials

1166
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,380
and track stream all of next year so

1167
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,940
there will be more tutorials and tracks

1168
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,079
again and we'll have a whole separate

1169
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,520
room to fill it with and we're very

1170
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,319
excited about that

1171
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:46,619
back to you guys thank you Kat

1172
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:47,700
um

1173
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,380
Alex

1174
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,880
well uh Ms garinsky just uh scuttled 80

1175
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,339
percent of my answer but uh

1176
00:44:58,339 --> 00:45:00,900
pre-covered we actually had the Sunday

1177
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,720
education track

1178
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,540
and this year we had the hackathon on

1179
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,099
Sunday which was

1180
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:10,520
set up so that people who don't code

1181
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,560
could effectively work in it there were

1182
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,920
places for mentors places for managers

1183
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,579
personally I hate writing code

1184
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:23,099
but we also had Eddie doing the DNS

1185
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:27,380
intro which was oversubscribed

1186
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,020
and from the plans that I know about

1187
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,420
there's going to be more of it in the

1188
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,060
conferences and as we reach out in the

1189
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,040
University that's also from what I

1190
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,740
understand obviously not being totally

1191
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,839
privy to what's going on for the next

1192
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,000
two years which is in the board's

1193
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,300
purview at this point uh more Outreach

1194
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,700
more educational on those lines but we

1195
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,339
don't want to become just another

1196
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:56,400
professional education company that you

1197
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,819
go to plop down your credit card take a

1198
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:02,280
class get a certificate it needs to be

1199
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,280
things that are relevant to the industry

1200
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,420
today

1201
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,060
relevant going forward

1202
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,359
and maybe even a little bit of History

1203
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,880
so you learn from

1204
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,579
why we did it how it broke the first

1205
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,619
time and how to keep it from breaking

1206
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,720
again

1207
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,319
thank you

1208
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,760
I

1209
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,440
I love training I love doing training

1210
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,780
I've got I've taught some classes some

1211
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,520
very Hands-On classes and I don't want

1212
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,599
to take up too much time because because

1213
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,300
part of the answer is what cat off uh

1214
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,359
uh added but I will point out that when

1215
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,619
I heard that we didn't have a tutorial

1216
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:42,359
room I offered to pay for it it turned

1217
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:43,500
out there wasn't enough time to get it

1218
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,780
to make a room available at this hotel

1219
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,880
um but that was it was already booked

1220
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,839
right

1221
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,579
yeah so

1222
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:51,660
um something that I'm trying to do in

1223
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,859
order to actually enable the community

1224
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,339
to do exactly those things thank you

1225
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:58,640
anything from this side yeah uh Michael

1226
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,160
so I um uh as I said earlier I'm a

1227
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,500
member of the education committee we're

1228
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,619
we're actively involved in soliciting uh

1229
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:10,740
courses uh to be uh to be developed and

1230
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,060
taught in conjunction with these

1231
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,359
meetings uh as Alex said uh Eddie

1232
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:21,060
Winstead uh delivered a fantastic and uh

1233
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:25,260
well-received DNS course on Sunday uh at

1234
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,700
the same time as the hackathon there

1235
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,700
were there were 14 people there uh when

1236
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,579
I was in the room it was it was really

1237
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:35,339
interesting to see uh that there were

1238
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:37,980
people there that were young and old and

1239
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,400
men and women from a variety of uh

1240
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,260
differing levels of technical background

1241
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,720
in differing Industries uh and they just

1242
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,660
sat around and like ran dig all day long

1243
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,060
and it probably helped them who was ever

1244
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,460
in there to understand more of Dixie's

1245
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,060
uh talk especially the the Doh piece of

1246
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,800
it

1247
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,839
so I like I the the education

1248
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:06,060
uh initiative is is alive and well where

1249
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,300
we're Beyond this uh the the street we

1250
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,220
are behind the projections of the

1251
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,260
Strategic plan but the forward progress

1252
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,180
is being made uh there's a network

1253
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,859
automation one in the works there's a

1254
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:19,020
networking fundamentals one uh in the

1255
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,300
works uh we're also looking to do

1256
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,240
finance and capacity planning uh as well

1257
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,700
as uh any other courses that we think

1258
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,339
are are worthwhile I uh trying to talk

1259
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,839
Lee into doing one I'm pretty much

1260
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:32,280
trying to talk everybody into doing one

1261
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,920
Warren would you like to do one

1262
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,520
um and uh the uh the last piece of it in

1263
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,680
the few seconds I have remaining uh was

1264
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,260
this idea of certifications and I'm not

1265
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,359
uh nor do I think the education

1266
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,579
committee is pushing for any like CCNA

1267
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:50,040
or ccie type certification like

1268
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,420
certainly we'll give out like a little

1269
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,880
PDF saying somebody took this course but

1270
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,700
we're not trying to become like a a big

1271
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,359
diploma shop

1272
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,339
uh Leslie sure

1273
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,819
um I did want to say two things one I

1274
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,859
think that cat and a cat has addressed

1275
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:09,119
some of the

1276
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,760
um formal education plans going forward

1277
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,260
and how there will be more of that in

1278
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,480
the next year but I also wanted to

1279
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,140
observe that learning isn't always just

1280
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,619
about formal education in this context

1281
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:24,839
um I actually remember when nanog was

1282
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,819
slipping towards

1283
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,800
um towards a trade Association and this

1284
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,220
was many moons ago and a very different

1285
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,900
instantiation of nanog and I will never

1286
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,700
be able to get out of my brain the image

1287
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,220
of the Cisco washing machine washing

1288
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,060
your traffic because literally 90 of the

1289
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,700
presentations were from vendors trying

1290
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,700
to sell their stuff we're not there I

1291
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,619
mean that's through the auspices of the

1292
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,599
of the program committee

1293
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,460
um but you know we we have a strong

1294
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,800
program we have the opportunity we

1295
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,540
should have the opportunity to all leave

1296
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,060
here Having learned something as well as

1297
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,760
networking and and you know hopefully

1298
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,980
building new plans and new things

1299
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,859
together on the internet so I'm not

1300
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:10,619
I am sensitive to Warren's concerns I'm

1301
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,780
sensitive to Jared's concerns but I

1302
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,220
think that we need to also keep a

1303
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,500
broader notion of what what is learning

1304
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,020
in our context

1305
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,900
thank you and I believe John sure uh

1306
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,540
Jared and Warren were you at namog 46 in

1307
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,720
Philadelphia

1308
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,240
that was my first yep so we we rolled up

1309
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,420
a cable system Mr Taub over there was a

1310
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,859
critical part I think Chris was there

1311
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:37,079
right to making you know because you you

1312
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,180
all were like hey hey John you keep

1313
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,920
running your mouth about V6 and cable

1314
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,859
like put up or shut up dude right

1315
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:46,020
right so I'm saying it for this way for

1316
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,859
a reason because I want to make sure

1317
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:48,000
that this is what we're talking about

1318
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,819
right so we rolled up a cable system to

1319
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:52,020
the Robert's ballroom at the top of

1320
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,839
those hotel and we showed everybody not

1321
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:56,220
just what it was about the planet was

1322
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,559
there Netflix was there

1323
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,800
Cisco cmts was their Tony and many other

1324
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,540
people from from you know Comcast were

1325
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,980
there at the time and we showed

1326
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,720
everybody not just like hey here it is

1327
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,460
nice shiny object don't touch we showed

1328
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,440
everybody how it worked right not that

1329
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,880
we thought anybody would like like most

1330
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,140
of the people here are going to go work

1331
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,660
at a cable system but it was showing

1332
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,760
people how things worked right it wasn't

1333
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,260
it wasn't like there was no tutorial

1334
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,640
none and it was technical very much we

1335
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,800
showed people came on and boot files

1336
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,440
cmts how do you get delegated prefixes I

1337
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,720
I disagree that is a tutorial you're

1338
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,160
showing how you built your network and

1339
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,740
that's great and I think tutorials are

1340
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,540
absolutely something that we should be

1341
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,520
looking at doing but pitching it under

1342
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,800
the name education I think is also maybe

1343
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,920
a bit of a misnomer 100 that the intent

1344
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,780
there was educational nature right and I

1345
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,819
think everybody not not only did this

1346
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:49,859
community learn from it we learned from

1347
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:51,420
it right you know because we were

1348
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,500
passionate about making sure that we did

1349
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,180
the right thing for our customers so

1350
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,980
let's be honest we also took a great

1351
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,240
deal from that experience showing you

1352
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,800
all what we thought

1353
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,900
right we thought what everybody wanted

1354
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,819
we were pretty close it turns out but

1355
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,500
that was huge it was a game changer

1356
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,940
right and we kept that going for like a

1357
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,559
decade I mean I mean Chris how long do

1358
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,300
we do that like a decade right it was a

1359
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,240
while right and that was at least from

1360
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,460
what I heard that was valuable I got we

1361
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,839
got a lot of positive feedback from that

1362
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:22,859
great yeah thank you John uh I'm gonna

1363
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:24,960
do one more question from the audience

1364
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,180
and then I want to give the candidates

1365
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,180
the ability to have closing remarks

1366
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,559
um that's too bad we've got three

1367
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:33,480
questions

1368
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,880
so most of our board tends to be from an

1369
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,460
Eric engineering or operator background

1370
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,920
um and one thing I always worry about is

1371
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,200
our financial awareness for board

1372
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,359
members specifically do any of you have

1373
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,940
experience with balance sheets profit

1374
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,619
and loss Etc because I feel like

1375
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:53,339
oftentimes the treasure for the board is

1376
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:55,319
like you have not it and so I'm just

1377
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:56,520
wondering if any of you actually bring a

1378
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,680
background in financials that would be

1379
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,559
useful on a board level to this

1380
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,319
thanks thank you Kat

1381
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:04,920
um

1382
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,079
it's been over here uh let's start with

1383
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:09,359
Alec

1384
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,680
well

1385
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,260
I was the founding treasurer of ninog

1386
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,559
and did the 501c3 paperwork for that

1387
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,980
I was the treasurer of the original

1388
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,440
science fiction organization which puts

1389
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,619
on a 4 000 person convention once a year

1390
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,540
and a bunch of other smaller stuff for

1391
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,900
five years I have been

1392
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,920
an active manager at the senior

1393
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,720
programming level for previous companies

1394
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,940
where I had a

1395
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,680
not going to admit how big a budget I

1396
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,740
had to manage but the um

1397
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,839
the name of the company equates to cool

1398
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,660
in Hawaiian so

1399
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,420
a bunch of budgeting experience at the

1400
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,880
industrial commercial and non-profit

1401
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,640
level as I said I have been a speaker to

1402
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,240
the IRS

1403
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:01,200
Lee

1404
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,319
I was the treasurer of Aaron for I think

1405
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,540
five of my nine years something like

1406
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,059
that so I certainly learned a lot about

1407
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:11,040
how to be a Treasurer not that I'm

1408
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,480
necessarily angling for that job because

1409
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,880
it's not the most exciting part of being

1410
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,700
on a board uh but uh there so yeah I've

1411
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,619
done that I was the treasurer of uh Open

1412
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:22,020
Hearth Foundation a community center I

1413
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,400
was uh

1414
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,500
uh I've also had profit loss

1415
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,220
responsibility for the past six years

1416
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,940
thank you uh Leslie sure

1417
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,559

yes I know how to read a p l statement

1419
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,540
yes I know how to read a balance sheet

1420
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,059
um and perhaps more importantly I know

1421
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:43,619
how to spend money and how to not spend

1422
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:44,700
money

1423
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,099

when you work for a particularly Frugal

1437
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,339
company is uh is difficult and it's not

1438
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:21,540
unlike the challenge we have here in

1439
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,520
front of us in network

1440
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,980
okay so thank you Kat for asking this

1441
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,839
particular question I have no direct

1442
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,020
Financial experience uh but I I can re

1443
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,480
uh I can read the Bible and Sheet uh I'm

1444
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,400
on the I mentioned earlier I'm on the

1445
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,200
board of directors of community IX it's

1446
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,980
a not-for-profit uh IX uh it's all

1447
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,160
volunteers with one paid employee so I

1448
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,740
know how to take the small amount of

1449
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,540
money that the community members give to

1450
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,700
us and spend it wisely on making a

1451
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,480
really robust Network

1452
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,640
all right thank you everybody uh is

1453
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,640
there an online question I got one no we

1454
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,980
can let's do it this comes from Marlene

1455
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,380
she's on the program committee

1456
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,440
what is your largest gap or area of

1457
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,619
growth you feel needs to be addressed by

1458
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:13,859
nanoc board and how do you propose to

1459
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:16,319
fill that need over the next year if

1460
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,859
selected

1461
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,800
hmm can you repeat the question

1462
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,760
sure what is the largest gap or area of

1463
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,460
growth you feel needs to be addressed by

1464
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,160
the nanog board and how do you propose

1465
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,220
to fill that need over the next year if

1466
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,700
selected

1467
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:40,040
foreign

1468
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,339
I think this is getting to be the horse

1469
00:56:46,339 --> 00:56:49,619
that we are all concentrating on

1470
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:54,119
and the Gap and need is New Blood

1471
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,059
the way I think we're going to do it is

1472
00:56:57,059 --> 00:56:58,980
through our Outreach which is currently

1473
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,180
underway

1474
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,339
of the universities

1475
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:06,660
by broadening our and Jared as much as I

1476
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,780
know you don't like HTML

1477
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,700
by broadening our footprint to use

1478
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,760
current Technologies

1479
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,099
slack Discord

1480
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,940
discourse which are two different things

1481
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,880
as I found out for my children

1482
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,740
um

1483
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,020
we just need to broaden our footprint

1484
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,240
bring in more people bring in new blood

1485
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,760
and try to break down the barriers to

1486
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,559
getting in

1487
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:34,319
let people know that anybody who is here

1488
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,140
is open to be buttonholed

1489
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,640
uh

1490
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,059
nanog is where I learned that vincerf

1491
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,400
really does wear three-piece suits when

1492
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,720
he's flying on the Saturday morning

1493
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,440
flight out of uh Disney World going home

1494
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,079
uh everybody in this industry is

1495
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,240
basically approachable we need to let

1496
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,579
people who are new to it know that we're

1497
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:57,900
all approachable

1498
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,800
uh not go broke in the process

1499
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,980
thank you Alex I'm going to close in so

1500
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,260
Leslie if you will sure

1501
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,200
um so I think that from my perspective

1502
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,240
um we need to understand that coming out

1503
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,339
of two years of pandemic and the impact

1504
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:16,200
that had on the finances here as

1505
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,780
outlined today in the members meeting

1506
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,339
that and and the hopes and aspirations

1507
00:58:20,339 --> 00:58:22,260
of where we go from here all the growth

1508
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,119
that we've been talking about

1509
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:25,680
um I think the biggest Gap or challenge

1510
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,020
is that the organization is Shifting

1511
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,400
Gears

1512
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,960
um and so how do we manage the gear

1513
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,599
shifting process and I think that that

1514
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,180
will mean in the context of being a

1515
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,619
board member I think that that's going

1516
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:38,880
to mean

1517
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,339
um revisiting the relationship of the

1518
00:58:41,339 --> 00:58:43,680
board and the staff and making sure that

1519
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,619
we are constructive in

1520
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:49,140
um helping the staff Shape Up plans that

1521
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,960
will be viable and vetable as we go

1522
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,460
along to not fall into some of the

1523
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,400
pitfalls we were talking about earlier

1524
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,319
um and making sure that we wind up at

1525
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,599
the end of that process with you know a

1526
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:03,599
nanog that has grown not only having

1527
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,339
spent more money on new things but

1528
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:07,500
having developed having invested that

1529
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,680
money in New Directions

1530
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,900
and still with a proper supervisory role

1531
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,700
between the board and the staff that

1532
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,859
should be leading all these things

1533
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:18,780
the staff and the volunteers that are

1534
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,579
leading all these things

1535
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:23,220
thank you Lee would you like to take

1536
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,619
this one I think we've largely covered

1537
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:27,180
the points that I think that that I

1538
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,859
think are are gaps where it's it's

1539
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:31,020
shorter with the finances for recovering

1540
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,880
for the pandemic it's the pretty much

1541
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,099
what we've uh already heard I think

1542
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:37,799
Marlene's a fantastic example of

1543
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:38,940
um bringing in New Blood and she's been

1544
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,099
an amazing contributor already

1545
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:42,780
um and

1546
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,980
I want to actually I want to be

1547
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,839
sensitive at the time and uh carry on

1548
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,559
thank you uh John

1549
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:51,599
it's a great question I think one of the

1550
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,040
things I can tell you from past

1551
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,440
experience choppiness is not good

1552
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,299
choppiness from an experience point of

1553
00:59:57,299 --> 00:59:58,619
view choppiness from a financial point

1554
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:00,059
of view right when I did a lot of the

1555
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:01,260
work with the ITF for a bit this thing

1556
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,299
called bits and bytes some some meetings

1557
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,000
we had a dozen sponsors some we had none

1558
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,920
it's tough to run a business that way

1559
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,440
right I mean go back to cats you know

1560
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,079
question it's a great example of like

1561
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:14,700
running a small business for a group

1562
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,799
that has no money I mean I had to do all

1563
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,260
the fundraising right so I think for you

1564
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,480
know common theme kind of looking across

1565
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,180
this this audience here this this board

1566
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,359
this this candidacy here is we you know

1567
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:28,799
we we need to make sure that we have

1568
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,480
some consistency both in the experience

1569
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,579
that people have when they come here by

1570
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:33,780
making sure that we've got consistency

1571
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,339
in our ability to deliver that from a

1572
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:36,780
program point of view right so the

1573
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,640
greater the integration the more that we

1574
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,859
can offer people a consistent experience

1575
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:43,079
as a newcomer here right so that so that

1576
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:45,059
we know how to grow these people

1577
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:47,040
throughout their lifetime with us if

1578
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,299
they're going to stay in this industry

1579
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,640
is pretty important what I can tell you

1580
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,559
is when it's not consistent it's tough

1581
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,000
it's tough to run a business it's tough

1582
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,579
to deliver a consistent product right

1583
01:00:56,579 --> 01:00:59,339
and we we are delivering a product our

1584
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:01,380
customers are in this room our customers

1585
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:03,839
have yet to appear here they're coming

1586
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,579
right we have to make sure that we have

1587
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:09,240
the ability to deliver that to them

1588
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,400
thank you John uh Michael did you want

1589
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,079
to take that one sure

1590
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:16,799
um the uh the biggest challenge in here

1591
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,920
and I I think everybody uh uh I'm

1592
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,839
guessing everybody here many people here

1593
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,220
were in the members meeting this morning

1594
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,380
and I think that the current board has a

1595
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,960
very uh Clear Eye to look at the

1596
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,940
financial challenges that we have ahead

1597
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:34,380
of us and I would love to be part of of

1598
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,599
helping overcome that challenge and the

1599
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:38,520
biggest areas of growth are I think what

1600
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,720
all of us have been talking about over

1601
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,180
time is the the continued relevancy of

1602
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,099
of the organization through through

1603
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:47,220
bringing in uh new uh new people from

1604
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,500
various walks of life and new areas of

1605
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,859
Technology

1606
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,540
foreign

1607
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,500
with that said I'd like to thank

1608
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,599
everybody for the questions from the

1609
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,440
audience online and uh there's no more I

1610
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,819
really want to give this time to the

1611
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:04,380
candidates to

1612
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,440
frankly encourage us to vote uh so I'm

1613
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,540
going to start with Leslie and you have

1614
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,760
a minute and a half to just convince the

1615
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,859
crowd sure

1616
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:15,839
um yeah so I think that the the one

1617
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,220
thing that I really like the thought I'd

1618
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,720
like to leave in your mind is that I

1619
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,480
think nanog is very important and it's

1620
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,960
an important piece of the overall

1621
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,579
cluster of Internet institutions that

1622
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:28,859
give us a a well-functioning and growing

1623
01:02:28,859 --> 01:02:31,740
internet in all the positive ways and

1624
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,220
I'm happy to help I'm happy to help in

1625
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,079
continuing on the board if that's what

1626
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:38,880
you would like me to do

1627
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,980
um but I'll be happy to help in any case

1628
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:44,099
no matter what going forward thank you

1629
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:46,680
thank you Alex

1630
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,619
wow

1631
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:51,780
I'm going to start this by saying this

1632
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,599
is the strongest panel of board

1633
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:58,099
candidates I have seen in many years

1634
01:02:58,099 --> 01:03:01,559
all of us bring a depth and breadth of

1635
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:05,400
experience so I don't think anybody here

1636
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,059
will do a bad job if elected I think any

1637
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:11,880
of us can do the job well

1638
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,280
I've been a volunteer with the

1639
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,140
organization for many years I've had a

1640
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,760
lot of fun doing it

1641
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,760
my company is a sponsor and they have

1642
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,339
committed to helping me with time and

1643
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:25,319
travel if I'm elected to the board so I

1644
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:28,260
do have that availability

1645
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,660
and if I don't get elected I'm going to

1646
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,040
keep working for the organization

1647
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,160
because I think it's important

1648
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,740
I'd like to leave a legacy as I come

1649
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:40,740
into the Twilight of my career of people

1650
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:44,280
who are there filling the gaps doing it

1651
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,140
and moving forward

1652
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,359
thank you Alex

1653
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:50,400
um let's hear from John

1654
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,040
there's no other group like this one

1655
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,980
right yeah the ITF brings in North

1656
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,420
America right I mean you have the other

1657
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,520
air regions like rape and what have you

1658
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,980
but it but there's a very the the value

1659
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,079
that we deliver to the community is very

1660
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,599
unique here and I think we're all up

1661
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:08,700
here because we we know how important

1662
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,799
that is to the longevity of everything

1663
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,299
that we've built for the entirety of our

1664
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:14,700
career right so from from my perspective

1665
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,099
similar to Leslie and Alex was saying is

1666
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:18,299
we're here because we want to help make

1667
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:21,000
sure that nadog lives on and is vibrant

1668
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,059
because if this if this community

1669
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,440
vaporizes or weakens in any way shape or

1670
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,720
form it will dramatically affect the

1671
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,220
ability for us to deliver a quality

1672
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,260
product to our customers right

1673
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,520
um you know you look across the the

1674
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,200
ecosystem the different organizations

1675
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,460
you know some of them are a bit more

1676
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,140
academic than others we bring the

1677
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,280
reality check

1678
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,680
to all those things and if we're not

1679
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,079
here to do that I you know I will I'll

1680
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,700
most certainly lose some sleep and I'm

1681
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,400
happy to contribute time whether on the

1682
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,740
board or not yeah yeah I came back in

1683
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,420
the in the fall of last year to to kind

1684
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,400
of do some talks I guess it was our

1685
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,980
first after covid and looking forward to

1686
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,480
continuing to do that would love to do

1687
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,220
it as part of the board but like again I

1688
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,079
want to punctuate how critical I view

1689
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:03,900
the value that we bring to the community

1690
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,619
thank you John uh lee

1691
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,660
when I was 12 my family moved across

1692
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,619
country

1693
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:12,780
um started a new school and I didn't

1694
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,059
have any friends I was I was an outsider

1695
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:16,920
as an outcast

1696
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,380
um it took me a long time to to find

1697
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,020
community and uh and I really didn't

1698
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,540
wasn't able to do that properly until I

1699
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,859
was in college

1700
01:05:25,859 --> 01:05:29,220
and I got on the vax and discovered the

1701
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,720
internet and I was able to get on to

1702
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,720
Usenet and I was able to use IRC and I

1703
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,280
met people who thought like me and

1704
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,559
people who uh thought differently than

1705
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,359
me would challenge me in my thoughts

1706
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,599
and uh and I found people who

1707
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:44,160
and I found my home I found the

1708
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,200
community that I cared about and I said

1709
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,180
this is what I want to do with my life I

1710
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,099
want to work on the internet and there's

1711
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:51,540
lots of different ways to do that but

1712
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,819
the part that fascinated me most was how

1713
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:55,559
the connections go together how you how

1714
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,960
you push these packet things around that

1715
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,619
was brilliant that was amazing so

1716
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:04,140
I'm so that that's where my passion for

1717
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,640
the internet comes from for this

1718
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,920
industry uh for the operators because we

1719
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,020
build the parts that make the the that

1720
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,940
move the packets

1721
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,640
um and and it's

1722
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,619
the

1723
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:18,480
uh this organization is the organization

1724
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,400
that makes it happen that is

1725
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,020
helped us get better at that helps us

1726
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,280

1727
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,500

1729
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,680

1730
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,059
coming maybe I'll do some tutorials when

1731
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:30,839
I have some more time to develop

1732
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:31,920

1733
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,480
thank you

1734
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,280
and Michael

1735
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,520
so I've spent the last hour advocating

1736
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,160
for myself for this position so I'll

1737
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,819
close with advocating against apathy so

1738
01:06:44,819 --> 01:06:48,299
there are just north of 700 nanog

1739
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:51,480
members uh there are far far less than

1740
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,359
700 people in this room uh I'm sure if

1741
01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:56,039
anybody took the time to sit in here and

1742
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:57,780
listen and ask questions you're all

1743
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,440
going to vote so the call to action is

1744
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,359
to encourage other members to vote

1745
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,460
encourage others to become members who

1746
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,240
aren't uh start volunteering your time

1747
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,859
become a mentor either formally through

1748
01:07:10,859 --> 01:07:14,099
nanog or informally and just at a bare

1749
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:16,559
minimum like be extra kind to one

1750
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,740

01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,640
the course of the week so there's really

1757
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,039
no excuse other than apathy and maybe

1758
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:40,319

1760
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,299
elections committee perspective we want

1761
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:48,480
to really see nanog represent and choose

1762
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,119
