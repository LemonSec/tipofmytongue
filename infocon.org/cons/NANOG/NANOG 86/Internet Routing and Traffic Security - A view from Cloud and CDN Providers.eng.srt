[Music]

3
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:09,059
this is a the routing internet routing

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,059
and traffic security track a view from

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,580
cloud and CDN providers

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,880
our first presentation is entitled

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,140
decentralized security of a globally

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,779
distributed system challenges and

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,279
opportunities

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,820
since 2001 Andre robachevsky has spoken

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,699
from the nanog stage five times most

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,560
recently providing a lightning talk

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,320
about the next chapter in manners in

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
2019

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
uh with that we'd like to welcome Andre

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,980
to the stage

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,980
bye thank you

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,360
um

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,120
so eight years ago almost eight years

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,620
ago

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,280
um

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,379
an initiative called mutually agreed

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,640
norms for routing security was started

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,500
and today together with you I would like

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,539
to look back at challenges and

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,659
opportunities we've seen on this way in

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,299
all this eight years and maybe distill

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,060
some of the lessons that we can apply to

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,040
a bigger challenge that were very common

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,340
on the internet which is a challenge of

31
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,220
securing uh a decentralized and

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,180
distributed system like the internet is

33
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,159
now eight years of routing security is

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,600
only a fragment

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,340
in more than 25 years of our effort

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,720
Collective effort

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,200
in trying to secure routing system

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,119
well 25 years is a long time especially

39
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,220
on the internet scale

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,119
so why is routing security so hard

41
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,740
I think a simple answer is it's

42
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,659
economics

43
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,420
because the while the incentive for the

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,119
global routing system as a whole a

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,200
business case

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,060
is significant

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,920
the business case for individual

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,420
networks is often not so much

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,179
because well partly because they're the

50
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,520
security of individual Network it

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,040
depends on actions or inactions of other

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,620
operators and therefore individual

53
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,200
Network can do only so much to secure

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,679
their own

55
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,900
that means that to secure routing we

56
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,020
need a concerted action with as little

57
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,660
as possible for free riding which is

58
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,160
enormously difficult task

59
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,819
so well in some of those cases which is

60
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,500
commonly known as collective action

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,160
problem uh regulation was called

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,500
to save us but in this particular case

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,200
it won't work partly because or mainly

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,120
because it's a global problem and

65
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,220
securing this in one jurisdiction will

66
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,220
not allow security or routing system

67
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,920
gnomes developing gnomes is much more

68
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,440
promising approach

69
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,120
but for this they need to be widely

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,640
accepted non-disputed

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,160
um not exactly low

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,360
so the majority can join but not to not

73
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,340
too low that it doesn't make any

74
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,480
difference

75
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,580
and what's very important is they should

76
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,379
be visible and measurable I mean we

77
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,019
should understand which networks while

78
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,180
I'm translating this to network uh

79
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,879
environment which Networks abide by

80
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,340
those norms and which are not

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,680
so manners which again stands for

82
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,180
mutually written on routing security

83
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,260
it's exactly built on two uh premises so

84
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,180
one it creates a baseline which is

85
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,819
called in mana's actions requirements

86
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,099
controls that networks need to implement

87
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,940
that is Undisputed and it leads to

88
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,400
changes in the routing system security

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,099
and the second it builds a community of

90
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,140
network operators that standby that

91
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,940
Implement actually those Norms that

92
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,500
demonstrate they Implement those

93
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,440
controls and they support by peer

94
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,780
pressure by their presence by their

95
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,580
voice uh this Baseline

96
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,140
now

97
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,080
the initiative was started with network

98
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,939
operators coming together and developing

99
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,560
those requirements there are four

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,779
requirements at that time and we call

101
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,238
that Network operators program but

102
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,860
immediately after the launch of this

103
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,020
program we had a challenge how to scale

104
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,580
this initiative up

105
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,580
it will sell with nine operators but as

106
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,380
you know there are more than 70 000

107
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,000
autonomous system operating in the

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,040
routing system so how to bridge this

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
huge gap

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
and we're looking for other partners for

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,220
partners that can help us to create sort

112
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,280
of a snowball effect in manners and the

113
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,800
next partner that came to mind and was

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,740
willing to partner with Madness was or

115
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,380
Internet exchange points and not

116
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,000
surprisingly because internet exchange

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,800
points they're sort of locus of

118
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,840
community activities they have their

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
communities with common operational

120
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,180
objectives where such Norms can be

121
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,000
spread further

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,720
now the program was launched in 2018

123
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,160
and two years later we looked at other

124
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,300
potential partners

125
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,880
and other potential Partners were CDN

126
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,860
and Cloud operator so although they're

127
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,600
sort of age networks and you can treat

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,880
them as a corporate as they're very

129
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,340
significant Edge Networks some

130
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,680
statistics shows that 50 of the traffic

131
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,560
is handled by them and routing mistake

132
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,340
can have very significant consequences

133
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,400
so CDN Cloud program was created and

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,680
launched in 2020. I want to talk about

135
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,139
this program a little bit more later in

136
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,280
the talk

137
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,100
and finally in 2021 we launched the

138
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,199
network equipment vendor program because

139
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,060
without equipment that can support those

140
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,860
controls you cannot achieve routing

141
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,039
security

142
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,220
Now actions for each of the problems are

143
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,479
different those requirements and

144
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,240
controls are tailored to particular

145
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,380
entity a particular group of of entities

146
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,699
depending on their position and their

147
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,539
role in in internet routing but there

148
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,639
are some common themes for instance for

149
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,800
most of them filtering is one of the

150
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,320
important actions which basically says

151
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,340
do not uh Emit and propagate incorrect

152
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,440
routing announcements

153
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,580
coordination is another common action

154
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,500
which says you have to be open to

155
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,419
coordinate and as you know many of the

156
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,400
incidents there if not prevented but

157
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,979
mitigated quickly by this ability to

158
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,720
coordinate across borders across

159
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,759
Networks

160
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,460
as you know routing security depends on

161
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,919
correctness availability of external

162
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,020
sources

163
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,419
rpki and irr repositories and three

164
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,220
important that information registered

165
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,100
there is correct and up to date and

166
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,720
maintenance of this information is one

167
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,220
another action

168
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,259
but also there is another action which

169
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,940
is not technical which is promoting in

170
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,060
others if you are network operators

171
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,039
it's your responsibility to promote this

172
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,199
among your customers

173
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,479
if you're an ixp promote this among

174
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,560
peers

175
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,840
if you're a CDN promote this among your

176
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,799
peering partners

177
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,800
so why are your Menace and the sort of

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,680
common messages were well first of all

179
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,020
by joining manners by implementing those

180
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,639
controls you improve your own security

181
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,840
posture

182
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,759
and that's a benefit because you don't

183
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,139
want for instance that your customer

184
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,660
becomes your Transit provider

185
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,960
and creates an outage for you

186
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,380
also more and more this Baseline becomes

187
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,560
a norm we see this I mean it's becomes

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,840
less and less acceptable to sort of be

189
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,860
sloppy

190
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,680
to create those mistakes and not to fix

191
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,400
them quickly

192
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,840
and another thing we sort of always

193
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,419
saying use Madness as a competitive

194
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,099
differentiator

195
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,440
now that part is I don't think it's

196
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,539
strong enough and I will talk about this

197
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:10,020
again a bit later a few slides away

198
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,479
we hope that it can be used but I'm not

199
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,340
sure it's used at the moment as a real

200
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,698
commercial differentiator

201
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,680
so I was talking about measurements so

202
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,479
if you talk about Norms you should be

203
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,740
able to measure you should be

204
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,900
transparent and for this who create a

205
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,000
tool called Menace Observatory and

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,180
Menace Observatory its role to basically

207
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,520
Monitor and

208
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,979
present the state of mana's conformance

209
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,580
right it's a conformance tool of men as

210
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,679
participants but because we're using a

211
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,539
measurement framework based on passive

212
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,360
measurements that do not require

213
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,580
cooperation from other networks we can

214
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,980
actually measure mana's conformance also

215
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,320
for non-participants for all networks on

216
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,660
the internet

217
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,580
it's transparent it uses publicly

218
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,860
available data it's passive as I said

219
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,620
and it's evolving so as Menace as

220
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,779
controls evolve we adjust the

221
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,240
measurement framework as well

222
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
that's a landing page of the Menace

223
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,860
Observatory where you can see sort of

224
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,420
some numbers and Trends uh uh related to

225
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,339
routing security and conformance to

226
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,019
manage controls

227
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,260
um publicly what we have available is uh

228
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,100
those averaged scores by country by

229
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,120
region

230
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,339
but for many participants more detailed

231
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,800
data is available uh the individual

232
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,660
schools of networks but also detailed

233
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,720
reports that explain why your network

234
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,580
got that score

235
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,640
and some work is underway to make those

236
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
schools actually publicly available so

237
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,320
when you go to Menace you can see this

238
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,800
sort of well that's the declared uh uh

239
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,540
uh controls and that's how they are

240
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,440
measured

241
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,680
which should improve credibility

242
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,540
well that's the progress so far were

243
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,060
eight years the

244
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,700
statistics are slightly outdated because

245
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,360
we are adding numbers by day but that's

246
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,640
the graph shows the rise in network

247
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,339
operators and we see similar things in

248
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,459
in other groups although uh those groups

249
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,940
are smaller

250
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,040
now I tried to answer the question

251
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,920
what's the impact does menace have any

252
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,880
impact

253
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,360
and of course it's speculative I mean

254
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,880
causality has to be proved here but I

255
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,720
put a few statistics on one graph and

256
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,940
in my opinion that's very positive we

257
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,399
see that number of culprits networks

258
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,339
involved in an incident it steadily

259
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,220
decreases while the number of

260
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,740
participants are growing I'm cheating a

261
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,079
little bit putting this on one slide but

262
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,420
still it's a nice slide and we also see

263
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,100
that routing information quality is

264
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,519
improving

265
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,959
I cannot stress strong enough that

266
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,360
Menace is a collaborative effort

267
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
internet society which I work for they

268
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,540
provide the secretarial function we

269
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,760
support manners financially and also

270
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,100
organizationally but the real sort of

271
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,860
efforts is done by Network operators CDN

272
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,500
providers ixps and network equipment

273
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,240
vendors that participate in matters

274
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,339
I'd like to sort of pause a little bit

275
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,820
and talk about CDN and Cloud program and

276
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,920
we'll see more presentations in this

277
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,860
session from CDN Cloud providers how

278
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,480
they

279
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,019
um their journey in routing security but

280
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,779
this program is interesting because

281
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:43,500
um

282
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,440
after being launched

283
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,019
the network the the CDN Cloud providers

284
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,320
came later a few months later well maybe

285
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,200
a year later back and said well we can

286
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,000
do better

287
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,880
we can create actions stronger we can

288
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,760
introduce more controls for instance one

289
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,200
of the important actions in every

290
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,680
program is filtering ability to prevent

291
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,540
incorrect routing announcements from

292
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,180
propagating and appearing in the

293
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,339
internet

294
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,120
and what we so thought of uh as a group

295
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,220
when we create this program and by the

296
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,440
way I have to say it's it was created

297
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,880
and developed as a community effort

298
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,920
because task force a working group was

299
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,740
created and then the last set of actions

300
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,959
was called for the last call for the

301
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,779
Amanda's community so what we thought is

302
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,200
why are we not requiring rpei as a

303
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,940
priority source for validating those

304
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,680
announcements

305
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,839
and while we were thinking about this we

306
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,940
also thought well and how what's the

307
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,980
priority how you validate should we

308
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,380
standardize a little bit the validation

309
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,820
flow

310
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,339
and also thinking well I mean route

311
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,339
objects in the irrs it's a problem but

312
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,440
even bigger problem is sets it's

313
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,839
sometimes a mess so should we streamline

314
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,540
this as well how you expand ours sets

315
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,880
what sort of semantics or sort of rules

316
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,779
should be there

317
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,180
and the same we expanded for Global

318
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,700
validation while the original action

319
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,279
didn't specify what needs to be there we

320
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,220
want it to be more explicit that this

321
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,200
information should be reflected in the

322
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,320
irr and rpgi systems

323
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,380
and where I say we are probably too too

324
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,060
much credit it was the working group

325
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,959
that created this

326
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,779
so another example of collaboration is

327
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,300
the tooling uh there is a GitHub with

328
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,940
manage tooling and some of them are

329
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,680
while they're little open source

330
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,019
projects that everyone is invited to

331
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,600
contribute some of them are contributed

332
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,839
by the participants of Madness

333
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,060
some of them are sponsored by internal

334
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,800
Society for instance maintenance

335
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,620
validator we're working on a tool that

336
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,440
allows automation of checking manners

337
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,740
conformance in more detail

338
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,820
or minus lab which can be used as

339
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,620
training material which is also an open

340
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,000
source project

341
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,459
or minus ixp validation tool which

342
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:18,000
checks how well rpki is implemented in

343
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,339
in route server validation flow

344
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,860
another facet the third one is

345
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,959
self-governance

346
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,360
while as I said internet Society

347
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,160
secretarial function more and more

348
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,959
decisions are now taken by a steering

349
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,459
committee I think steering committee was

350
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,279
created two years ago it's a nine member

351
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,199
steering committee I don't know if any

352
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,180
members of this Mana steering committee

353
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,399
are in the room

354
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,680
probably not

355
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,920
um and well role of steering committee

356
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,579
the regular meetings every uh two three

357
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,440
months a meeting of suing committee

358
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,480
reviewing approving Menace actions but

359
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,880
also looking at the developments uh

360
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,760
advising on on priorities and so on and

361
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,779
so forth

362
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,060
and by the way in November there is

363
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,040
another election coming up it's

364
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,680
electronic mana's participants are

365
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,860
allowed to

366
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,680
nominate to be nominated and to vote so

367
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,420
if you're a managed participant please

368
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,740
stay tuned to that

369
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,120
I would like to talk a little bit about

370
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,720
what's next

371
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,100
and here we go about challenges and

372
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,839
opportunities so if you look at Madness

373
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,480
and ask does manners work and you can

374
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,820
hear uh yes it is it is community

375
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,880
focused it's based on peer pressure in a

376
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,279
has reputational value I think I spoke

377
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,380
to many separatus and they feel that

378
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,980
bearing mana's badge it is a sign of of

379
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,440
higher reputation of better quality of

380
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,260
operations but there are a lot of areas

381
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,880
of improvement our attempts to make

382
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,519
conform and stronger or conformants are

383
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,800
all stronger

384
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,800
to request more feedback to engage and

385
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,500
encourage more participation from the

386
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,600
whole manners Community it has

387
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,339
limitations

388
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,060
and we think that the core of the

389
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,660
problem is in the how strong or how weak

390
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,339
is the business case because it can go

391
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,860
only so far you can ask only so much

392
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,980
from an oak operator as much value they

393
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,260
get from Menace and as long as just

394
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,000
reputational value

395
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,120
that's what you get in return

396
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,000
so there is still not enough incentive

397
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,100
to excel

398
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,560
so what we are working right now is

399
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,000
we're creating we're trying to create

400
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,759
another tier in manners

401
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,339
so Menace is a community reputational

402
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,620
thing is very good it has a lot of

403
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,320
awareness but we are trying to distill

404
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,320
sort of create a more ambitious group of

405
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,339
mana's participants that can aspire to a

406
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,160
higher set or more strong set of

407
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,740
requirements

408
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,260
and we focus mostly on customer provider

409
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,939
relationship because that's where they

410
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,520
can get the value proposition from so if

411
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,919
customers begin to Value this quality

412
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,980
Mark then it becomes it it's a business

413
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,280
case that why would you join and put

414
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,740
extra efforts into becoming a managed

415
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,799
plus member

416
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,400
so this work has just started and in

417
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,020
fact it's open for everyone not just

418
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,940
manage participants to develop this so

419
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,620
so if you're interested please contact

420
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,059
us

421
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,059
but what we are thinking of it should go

422
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,160
maybe beyond the initial set of

423
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,200
requirements of Madness and maybe Beyond

424
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,900
just routes and security I think what

425
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,240
ultimately the stack is traffic security

426
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,760
and that's what we should be looking uh

427
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,299
uh at it should also be better line what

428
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,799
customers require from their

429
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,720
connectivity provider not what

430
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,480
connectivity provider can make

431
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,700
so better alignment with this can

432
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,520
improve value proposition

433
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,440
and another challenge that we need to

434
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,799
overcome and discuss is how can we make

435
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,500
audit more credible and transparent

436
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,140
as I said right now we are using passive

437
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,580
measurements but passive measurements

438
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,679
have limitations there only so much you

439
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,380
can see from the outside about controls

440
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,900
that are implemented in the network just

441
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,880
to give you one example

442
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,740
on filtering side where measuring

443
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,780
non-compliance so if if a network is

444
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,940
implicated in an incident that is an

445
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,260
indication that controls are not

446
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,480
implemented but we can say for sure that

447
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,820
controls are implemented in particular

448
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,520
Network so we need to look deeper maybe

449
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,440
without on-site audience because that

450
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,539
would be over the top but how can we

451
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,299
make it stronger

452
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,039
so what's next

453
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,020
well first of all if you haven't joined

454
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,179
men's please join it's not that

455
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,820
difficult and it will strengthen the

456
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,760
effort if you're interested in Menace

457
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,320
plus developments please get in touch

458
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,340
with us

459
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,660
and

460
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,539
even if you're not the Menace uh

461
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,059
participant please ask your providers

462
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,539
are there manners conformant and if not

463
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,340
why not

464
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,620
I think that brings me to the last slide

465
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,939
of my talk thank you

466
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,520
thank you

467
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,700
are there any questions

468
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,900
okay thanks for the presentation that

469
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,320
was us is there a real-time lag between

470
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,360
when the standards ITF standard is

471
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,880
formed let's say a new security on the

472
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,640
routing protocol right is formed to a

473
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,980
device vendor or a cloud operator

474
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,640
actually implements it to when you are

475
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,220
proposing and auditing to when it gets

476
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,980
into the auditing tool right

477
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,200
to when there's an actionable mitigation

478
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,140
done how how much is that entire Loop

479
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,140
the the lag time between you know when

480
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,880
there's a new standard or an extension

481
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,980
to the standard versus when it is

482
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,660
implemented to when it's actually

483
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,179
actionable with the auditing so it's can

484
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,760
you give us an idea of any real time

485
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,640
uh because this is a lagging audit right

486
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,220
so but when the standards is upgraded

487
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,440
what is the lag in which actually

488
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,660
there's something actionable out of it

489
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,880
thank you yeah well I think the lag is

490
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,440
certainly not real time and it's much

491
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,660
more I think it it can be measured in

492
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,240
years sometimes because from the moment

493
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,340
the standard is developed it needs to be

494
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,580
adopted by the uh by the vendors and

495
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,620
that needs to be sort of deployed in new

496
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,260
equipment and then manage it's actually

497
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,760
not immediate implementation of

498
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,160
Standards the Menace requirements and

499
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,440
controls are distilled from past current

500
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,559
practices and standards right and they

501
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,539
uh they're actually not the best current

502
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,700
practice I shouldn't probably say that

503
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,280
but their minimum base requirement

504
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,120
so lag can be significant and Menace

505
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,860
actions there also those controls are

506
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,539
pretty stable we can't change them

507
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,299
quickly right because it it means that

508
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,760
people signed up for one set of

509
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,280
requirements will need to resign up and

510
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,140
right now we don't have this kind of you

511
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,960
know annual recertification of Madness

512
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,880
participants so the lack can be

513
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,039
significant but we think the current

514
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,280
controls if implemented widely they can

515
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,799
still make a very significant impact in

516
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,780
routing security

517
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,960
foreign

518
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,900
thank you Andre

519
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,000
uh the second talk in this track is

520
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,039
entitled a multi-pronged approach for

521
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,620
securing internet routing uh joining us

522
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,559
remotely today is Anise shake and he is

523
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,059
with the global networking team at

524
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,220
Google where he works on software

525
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,919
systems to support network management

526
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,960
Cloud networking and routing Security in

527
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,080
Globe in Google's production networks uh

528
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
anise has been a long time contributor

529
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,860
to nanog meetings for almost eight years

530
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,500
his participation on this track marks

531
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,080
the fourth time that Anis is presenting

532
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,539
at nanog with that we'd like to uh

533
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,400
welcome Anis remotely thank you

534
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,520
thanks Steve uh hopefully people can

535
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,320
hear me okay

536
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,580
um

537
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,140
first I'm really sorry not to be there

538
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,840
in person I was planning to be there in

539
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,179
LA with uh with all of you in person uh

540
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:46,559
that didn't quite work out in the last

541
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,700
minute so having to present remotely uh

542
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,159
hopefully this will work out okay so the

543
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,440
theme of this session is um sort of a

544
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,840
cloud provider perspective on routing

545
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,020
routing and traffic uh security and

546
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,760
um I'm going to try to give a little bit

547
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,380
of perspective on how we've approached

548
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,720
the problem at Google

549
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,640
um using a number of different

550
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,460
techniques uh since we really found that

551
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,860
there's no single technique that works

552
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,900
well I'll be presenting work that

553
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,220
actually spans

554
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,080
um multiple teams inside of Google I'm

555
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,179
really proud to work with some fantastic

556
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,100
engineers in our development teams our

557
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,860
SRE teams and our operations teams and

558
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,659
it's really just my privilege to to

559
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,320
present the work done by many others

560
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,080
so let's start with um a little bit of

561
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,419
background about the the network

562
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,159
um you know Google runs a very large

563
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,679
owns and operates a very large private

564
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,620
Network to support its Cloud this this

565
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,720
picture sort of shows the customer

566
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,480
external facing view of

567
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,900
um how customers can deploy workloads in

568
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,940
the cloud and also connect to our

569
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,220
Network in particular I'd call out the

570
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,960
the number of edge locations it's a

571
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,640
slight underestimate of where of the

572
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,760
number of locations that um uh that peer

573
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,620
networks can connect to Google and so we

574
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,020
reach our customers and users largely

575
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,700
through peering and also through some

576
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,559
private connections as I'll show in a

577
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,020
second so this roughly

578
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,360
um you know just under 200 or so uh

579
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,740
locations where we connect to other

580
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,020
networks which is relevant for for this

581
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,539
discussion

582
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,460
so a little bit more background so when

583
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,059
we look at Google's um uh private win it

584
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,679
supports or two large classes of

585
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,720
services one is some very large user

586
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
Services we have about nine services

587
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,240
today that have about a billion or more

588
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,780
users globally you can see the list here

589
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,960
and then also uh this network supports

590
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,419
traffic to and from cloud customers so

591
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,580
these are businesses from

592
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,580
um every industry all different sizes

593
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,520
that connect to us for computing

594
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,780
infrastructure and services

595
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,039
so Google by this um kind of view looks

596
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,100
like a stub Network by the traditional

597
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,140
definition but we're an atypical stub

598
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,600
Network in the sense that we have a very

599
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,460
large peering surface uh you know

600
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,400
thousands of networks ranging from uh

601
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,880
Global Network providers uh tier one and

602
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,400
so on all the way down to small Regional

603
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,419
and even consumer uh broadband

604
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,919
providers and we also have customers

605
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,960
that connect directly to us by appearing

606
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,179
to access some specific types of

607
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,220
services from the Google Cloud platform

608
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,020
and this doesn't count sort of the

609
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,520
private connections that we also support

610
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,980
that don't use peering they use uh

611
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,539
private connections that we call Cloud

612
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,179
interconnect so appearing at Google is

613
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:43,260
done via roughly 100 or so

614
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,940
um private interconnection facilities

615
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,159
and another 90 or so public internet

616
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,960
exchange points where we maintain a

617
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
presence

618
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,400
so with that background let's move to

619
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,140
internet routing security and the

620
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,000
disruptions that we see I don't think I

621
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,480
have to say much in this forum about uh

622
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,520
the problems of routing security I think

623
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,320
Andre covered some of it well

624
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,020
um you know it's uh certainly very

625
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,460
impactful for us and we pay a lot of

626
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,900
attention to routing security because

627
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,059
when we have disruptions caused by

628
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,120
hijacks or leaks it easily causes black

629
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,679
holes you know high traffic

630
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,480
concentration which leads to congestion

631
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,059
or packet loss and then even traffic

632
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,559
redirection and potential for

633
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,380
interception so it's a very serious

634
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,059
concern for for us and for I would say

635
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,520
all cloud and content providers

636
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,799
um from a cloud provider perspective we

637
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,720
need to protect against multiple types

638
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,940
of disruption so on one hand we worry

639
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,400
about hijacks and leaks of our own

640
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,039
routes in the internet this impacts

641
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,200
users and customers ability to reach

642
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,360
Google services

643
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,960
um

644
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,059
and on the other hand we also care about

645
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,419
routes that are

646
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:52,620
advertised to us directly that may be

647
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,360
invalid so bogus routes that we get

648
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,820
impact reachability back to our users

649
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,820
and also for uh Cloud customers that

650
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,559
host with us you know their ability to

651
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,000
reach their users and external Services

652
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,740
gets impacted by that so we need to

653
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,480
worry about both

654
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,700
um uh aspects of the problem and and how

655
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,279
to detect and mitigate the impact when

656
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,679
it does happen

657
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,480
so we've organized our work in this

658
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,260
space

659
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,840
um into four broad areas uh and for the

660
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,220
rest of the talk I'll cover some

661
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,559
specific details of systems that we've

662
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,779
built in each of these spaces but as the

663
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,279
overview

664
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,980
um we have a route intent publishing

665
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,659
which is really the problem of how we

666
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,020
make sure that uh Google and gcp routes

667
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,360
are up to date at all times in public

668
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,860
Registries so this enables other

669
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,799
networks to validate you know our routes

670
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,840
um when it comes to propagating but when

671
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,159
they receive announcements for Google

672
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,679
routes and it prevents propagations of

673
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,200
hijacks obviously so this helps protect

674
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,940
connectivity you know back to Google

675
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,580
from the The Wider internet

676
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,140
um the second sort of pillar here is

677
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,299
around validation of Route announcements

678
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,100
that we receive so we've been working

679
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,900
over several years with our peers and

680
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,179
our customers to register the routes

681
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,559
that they have so that we can build

682
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,720
correct filtering and of course others

683
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,039
can build filtering as well for those

684
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,080
same networks and then deploy those

685
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,580
filtering systems to accept you know

686
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,320
valid routes from from all of our peers

687
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,360
and this prevents us from accepting

688
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,860
those bogus routes and make sure that

689
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,860
connectivity uh from Google and gcp is

690
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,600
protected

691
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,279
the next area is really focused on

692
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,940
visibility so uh this has to do with um

693
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,580
you know our focus on on building first

694
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,659
party and third-party monitoring systems

695
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:35,520
uh that alert on hijacks that happen

696
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,140
outside of Google's Network where we

697
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,600
don't have direct visibility so we use

698
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,400
other sources and some of our own

699
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,860
sources this helps us to proactively

700
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,419
reach out and mitigate when we do see

701
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,059
problems especially significant problems

702
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,919
um outside when we see hijacks or leaks

703
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,679
of our routes it does reduce the mean

704
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,260
time to repair but as you know this

705
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,360
depends often on actions taken by

706
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,659
external networks so this ultimately

707
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:03,779
some dependency that we have on uh other

708
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,640
networks to take some to some action

709
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,779
whether it's the offending Network

710
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,600
itself or maybe an upstream provider to

711
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,760
stop propagating or accepting some bad

712
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,779
routes

713
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,320
and then finally following along with um

714
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,520
Andre's talk you know I think a big part

715
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,559
of our Focus has also been on how we

716
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,720
collaborate to accelerate progress in

717
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,700
this space this is not an area that

718
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,620
Google alone can solve or any cloud

719
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,600
provider really can solve

720
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,039
um I'll be talking about this problem

721
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,779
from the perspective of Google but a lot

722
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:31,980
of the work that we're doing here is

723
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,620
much more generally applicable we have

724
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,380
been uh active members of the cloud and

725
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,799
CDN program in manners and um have found

726
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,059
it a very

727
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:46,140
um valuable uh means of collaboration uh

728
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,820
We've it gives us an opportunity to work

729
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,620
with other providers to align on some

730
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,860
common ideas and solutions even develop

731
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,440
policies that we can sort of align on

732
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,080
together and also gives us the Forum to

733
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,360
share some experience and information

734
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,620
with other miners numbers so it's been

735
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,799
super useful in that regard

736
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,899
okay so let's jump into some of the

737
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,460
specific systems we've built to

738
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,980
implement some of this

739
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,240
um I'll start with route intent

740
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,960
publishing so here um the idea is to uh

741
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,760
make sure that our routes are are

742
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,140
published and maintained most

743
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,500
importantly in public databases like the

744
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,059
internet routing Registries as well as

745
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,760
the rpki so at Google we have multiple

746
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,440
engineering teams that are responsible

747
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,659
for our external announcements so our

748
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,580
first problem was you know collecting

749
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,440
these intent sources and consolidating

750
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,020
them into one sort of set of intent

751
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,460
sources from which we could build an

752
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,559
automated pipeline that basically

753
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,140
periodically looks for changes in those

754
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,240
intent sources and updates our

755
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,700
registrations in in the irr we use radby

756
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,580
for our registrations and also in the

757
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,360
rpki and we've used so far hosted rpgi

758
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,940
Services run by the different Regional

759
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,679
internet registries

760
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,279
um some of these rir host rpgi Services

761
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,620
have programmatic apis that we can take

762
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,760
advantage of from an automation

763
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,279
perspective fortunately those are the

764
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,080
same

765
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,000
rirs that also uh we have most of our

766
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,399
routes in but then we do have some that

767
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,940
still require some manual uh management

768
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,260
which fortunately is a relatively small

769
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,600
number of routes so at this point we've

770
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,179
registered you know nearly all of Google

771
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:28,440
and gcp routes in both rpki and irr

772
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,059
but there's a second half of this

773
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:33,360
problem which is to monitor the state of

774
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,880
those registrations so we do this by

775
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,960
Consulting a number of third-party

776
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,539
um data sources that indicate status of

777
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,640
of routes in particular that will show

778
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,039
us any route that's seen with uh with

779
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,980
with the Google origin that looks like

780
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,899
um it may be our rpgi invalid which

781
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:53,460
might indicate a gap in our registration

782
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,020
system maybe something we missed in our

783
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,640
intent sources

784
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,220
um for a change in the rpki that that we

785
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,260
should know about One Challenge that I

786
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,220
don't think a lot of people understand

787
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,919
when they start down the rpki journey

788
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,419
with registering their routes is that

789
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,159
the management and maintenance is as

790
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,779
important more important than the

791
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,419
initial registration right so I think

792
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:15,179
um this uh sort of ensures that we get

793
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,740
notified quickly when there's a problem

794
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,120
because if one of our routes goes

795
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,500
invalid of course there's a risk that

796
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,059
it'll get filtered since more and more

797
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,580
large networks are doing

798
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,799
um filtering based on our PTI and origin

799
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,840
validation so we have this continuous

800
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,399
monitoring system that will proactively

801
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,840
detect these gaps

802
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,179
we've also deployed um as another means

803
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:38,520
to protect Google routes

804
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,679
outside this notion of pure locks which

805
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,779
I think has been introduced a while back

806
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,899
in this forum by uh job and maybe others

807
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,220
as well

808
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,200
um so peer locks are a simple form of

809
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,960
aspath filtering where effectively we

810
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,320
work with large providers to build

811
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,659
simple as path filters that will only

812
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,940
accept Google originated routes from

813
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,220
specific as typically this would be from

814
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,799
Google itself and in some cases it might

815
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,220
be from from us directly or from one of

816
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,679
our regional transit providers for

817
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,659
example so this helps mitigate

818
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,340
propagation of large leaks and in fact

819
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,919
we started looking at this technique

820
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,140
after we suffered a pretty big impact

821
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,240
from a large route leak back in 2018

822
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,960
that I'm sure people may recall

823
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,760
um and so far this has been fairly

824
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,500
successful we've implemented peer locks

825
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,080
with about 15 large Tier 1 and Transit

826
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,019
providers around the internet and sort

827
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,880
of work with them periodically to keep

828
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,039
the peer lock the filters up to date

829
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,440
coming to Route filtering um you know

830
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,940
the focus here again is on validating

831
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,799
all incoming routes that we receive at

832
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,720
our peering Edge and here we've deployed

833
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,240
multiple filtering mechanisms to address

834
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,860
the different kinds of hijacks that we

835
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,120
see

836
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,519
um the first one is on is is filtering

837
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,140
Based on data that's in the public

838
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,260
internet routing Registries or irrs this

839
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,380
basically builds a view of what routes

840
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,019
appear is expected or allowed to send to

841
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,000
US based on you know the routes that

842
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,060
itself is registered well as sort of the

843
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,339
transitive expansion of the as sets

844
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,899
that contains the networks behind them

845
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:22,199
so as as Andre alluded to in his talk at

846
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,359
the beginning there's some standards

847
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:26,219
that we've also worked on and how you do

848
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,739
as said expansion in a in a standard and

849
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:31,199
common way to make it clear um you know

850
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,359
house that allow lists are built the

851
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,859
challenge with irr data of course is

852
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,540
that you know there is High coverage but

853
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,839
the data can be stale it can be invalid

854
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,540
it might be contradictory so that

855
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,879
requires some work with all of our peers

856
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,699
to ensure that the data hygiene uh

857
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,859
improves and and we've made uh some

858
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,659
progress some reasonably good progress

859
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,520
on that this is currently rolled out

860
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,560
widely across most of our ISP peering

861
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,460
sessions

862
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,619
um and we're we're sort of transitioning

863
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:00,839
from what we call uh depref mode to

864
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,020
reject mode where we're rejecting uh IR

865
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,940
invalid routes on many of our sessions

866
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,080
now

867
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,460
um the other type of filtering of course

868
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,200
is Route origin validation based on our

869
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,119
pqi this is where we're filtering on the

870
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,980
allowed origin based on rows that are

871
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,740
registered in the rpki prevents a lot of

872
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,500
different types of misconfiguration

873
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,780
oriented hijacks the challenge of course

874
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,380
with rpgi is that the coverage is much

875
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,520
lower so uh you know I think as we know

876
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,859
uh just under 40 of the ipv4 space is

877
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,359
registered which means a lot of the

878
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,680
space is yet to be protected in rpki we

879
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,480
do have this in pilot now is active

880
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,859
filtering and it's targeted for

881
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:42,540
extending the the rollout over the

882
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,400
course of this year and early next year

883
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,839
so most of our appearance sessions

884
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,579
particularly in terms of how irr-based

885
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:53,099
route filtering works this is a pipeline

886
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,500
that runs periodically we collect data

887
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,140
from roughly 25 different routing

888
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,420
Registries we really were really

889
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,099
interested in reducing that number to

890
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:04,020
those that that support you know only

891
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,760
those that support authentication for

892
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,020
example

893
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,599
um we also collect data from peeringdb

894
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,780
to get as set information this is

895
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,780
collected periodically and we build a

896
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,180
view of of the routes that each peer is

897
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,980
allowed to

898
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,680
um to announce to us we store this in a

899
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,180
system that we call the route intent

900
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,220
store and this is used to build

901
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,859
effectively a route filter that's

902
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,180
essentially an allow list of those

903
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,160
routes that then gets rolled out to the

904
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,800
network globally you know on a periodic

905
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,460
basis so we keep the the filters up to

906
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,040
date as changes happen in the IRS

907
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,060
through this periodic collection

908
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,520
analysis processing and then roll out to

909
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,920
the network

910
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,780
we also publish this information to our

911
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,520
ISP portal I'll say more about this a

912
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,839
little bit later in the talk to help

913
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,300
peers see the current status of their

914
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,240
routes in terms of ir validity we've

915
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,880
used two different modes for irr

916
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,560
filtering we started with deepref mode

917
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,359
where we're essentially lowering the

918
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:07,980
preference of routes that are here is

919
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,839
invalid in the irr and this was meant to

920
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,880
be you know after initial Communications

921
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,680
to the peers telling them that we're

922
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,240
doing this

923
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,560
um you know this has a more direct

924
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,320
impact on traffic so that uh

925
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,000
they would actually take some notice and

926
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,619
make changes and we work with peers on

927
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:23,760
that

928
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,140
um we've now started as I said

929
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,240
transitioning to reject mode that

930
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,640
provides better protection than simply

931
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,400
uh lowering the lower local preference

932
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,180
of

933
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,579
um of invalid routes there's a few

934
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,260
issues of course with ir based filtering

935
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,880
that we've had to deal with

936
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,619
um aside from the data availability and

937
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:41,960
accuracy that I mentioned already

938
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,640
there's the issue of making sure that

939
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,320
the filters are scaling managing their

940
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,660
scale on routers and also that they're

941
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,400
you know since this is a global rollout

942
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,400
to our peering Edge uh according to our

943
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,260
production principles this is done in a

944
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,760
gradual and Progressive Way which means

945
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,339
that it it happens over uh roughly a

946
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,759
week's time

947
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,320
um moving on to our pki-based filtering

948
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,000
our architecture looks roughly like this

949
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,200
it's a bit different than the

950
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,619
traditional um uh rpki filtering that

951
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,260
you may have seen uh we have sort of the

952
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,000
top half of this is a pipeline that

953
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,079
collects

954
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:16,800
um

955
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,660
the data from the rpgi we have a

956
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,119
replicated set of uh relying party

957
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,040
instances that collect data from trust

958
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,000
anchors and and rpki repositories and

959
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,579
builds this into an internally developed

960
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:33,180
rpgi cache that has the latest erps from

961
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,260
these RP replicas then at the bottom we

962
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,180
have essentially a monitoring and

963
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,880
validation system so we have

964
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,820
a globally distributed set of

965
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,560
horizontally scaled validators that

966
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,079
collect uh route information they

967
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,520
monitor the routes at the appearing Edge

968
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,260
in other words as they come in through

969
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,359
this route listener layer and we'll

970
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,099
validate the routes against the rpki

971
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,839
cache contents that they have and then

972
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,700
if they detect that a route is invalid

973
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,160
in the rpki they will automatically

974
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,200
install a filter

975
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,599
um to remove that Realm

976
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,200
so it's um it works in a in a more

977
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,540
reactive uh fashion and we've had to

978
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,280
build a couple of safety mechanisms here

979
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,980
one is that the rpki cache itself

980
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,700
um

981
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,760
uh sometimes runs into

982
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,760
um situations where a large amount of

983
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,680
data disappears let's say from the rpki

984
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,140
because of a failure in the RP uh or

985
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,520
some other issues with downloads so

986
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,980
we've built a fail static type approach

987
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,500
here where we'll use the last good set

988
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,359
of cache contents and continue until

989
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,640
that can be repaired and we also have a

990
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,099
mechanism to provide overrides if

991
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:42,720
there's a problem in the rpki data where

992
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,780
we can add a local override to the rpki

993
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,940
cache very similar to you know other

994
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,040
standard mechanisms using slurm for

995
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,279
example

996
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,099
um just a little bit about uh

997
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:58,500
how we help our peers in terms of

998
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,839
visibility so the peering portal that

999
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,940
Google has maintained for a long time

1000
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,500
has been extended over the last couple

1001
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,040
years with a lot more information about

1002
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,619
uh route uh validity so the bgp view

1003
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,960
that we have shows up here that appears

1004
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,119
with us all the routes that we see and

1005
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,640
their status from an irr and rpki

1006
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,859
perspective and then if there's a

1007
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,079
problem detected there's additional

1008
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,119
details that are available it helps them

1009
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,980
troubleshoot what the problem might be

1010
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,200
so for example in this case there's no

1011
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,940
route object for this particular route

1012
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,920
or there may be an aset object that's

1013
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,839
missing and it'll give information about

1014
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,280
you know what as that objects we're

1015
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,220
using what Rod objects we're seeing so

1016
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,220
it helps peers understand quickly uh how

1017
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,379
they might be able to fix their IR data

1018
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,300
um the last sort of part of this is

1019
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,579
around the monitoring and alerting

1020
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:51,960
um there's not a ton to say here except

1021
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,280
that I just wanted to mention a couple

1022
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,740
of things uh one is that we use the same

1023
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,839
sort of intent sources that we use for

1024
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,940
publishing our routes in the rpki and RR

1025
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,520
to also populate our monitoring system

1026
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,740
so as I said we have both first and

1027
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,660
third-party monitoring some of the

1028
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,160
interesting challenges here really have

1029
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,560
to do with improving the signal to noise

1030
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,300
ratio with the sort of Route monitoring

1031
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,700
raw alerts are pretty frequent we've

1032
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,200
built some heuristics that make sure

1033
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,260
that you know an alert is for an event

1034
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,240
rather is both persistent and also

1035
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,220
widely observed or widely enough

1036
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,099
observed such that it merits raising an

1037
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,960
alert and and let's say paging someone

1038
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,780
to go take a look the mitigation as I

1039
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,339
said before generally requires some

1040
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:35,160
actions by external networks so it does

1041
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,260
have some dependency but it has helped

1042
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,859
us proactively detect an alert on events

1043
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,060
that we wouldn't have otherwise even

1044
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,920
known about

1045
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,119
okay

1046
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,900
so I will um start to wrap up with a

1047
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,760
couple of observations and experience

1048
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,740
that we've had in building these systems

1049
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,960
over the last couple of years

1050
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,700
um one is that you know the irr-based

1051
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,440
filtering service drove

1052
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,900
um meaningful improvements in peer data

1053
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,460
hygiene I think this engagement with

1054
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,800
Communications and then moving from sort

1055
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,839
of depress and then reject mode for

1056
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:10,680
filtering has helped improve overall IR

1057
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,200
data hygiene and we've seen a slow but

1058
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,520
steady Improvement in the overall

1059
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,680
validity of the prir data that we see

1060
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,260
we've also adopted policies where you

1061
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,820
know every new session that we turn up

1062
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,619
has to have valid IR entries and that's

1063
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:23,579
helped Drive some additional

1064
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:26,820
improvements we did notice that we see a

1065
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,280
lot more rpki and valid routes than what

1066
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,680
we observe and what what is observed in

1067
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,740
the public routing tables so we see for

1068
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,119
example some invalid routes are

1069
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,359
advertised only to us and peers

1070
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:40,260
performing some forms of traffic

1071
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,480
engineering

1072
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,920
often are misaligned with their roles in

1073
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,060
other words they can't keep their role

1074
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,160
was up with the traffic engineering that

1075
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,900
they're doing on routes that they may

1076
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,280
send us

1077
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,820
I would argue that rpki registration and

1078
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,859
management is still too hard we haven't

1079
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:57,480
made it easy enough for operators to do

1080
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,280
this this is based on just our

1081
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,440
observation and the amount of churn in

1082
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,000
the valid and valid routes that we see

1083
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,280
at our Edge

1084
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,480
there's too many different interfaces

1085
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,400
and policies that are used for example

1086
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,400
in hosted rpki services today and it

1087
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,079
requires some significant investment in

1088
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:15,540
automation to keep them updated and then

1089
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,180
finally rpki is important but it doesn't

1090
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,740
solve all of our problems right we've

1091
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,800
seen real instances not hypothetical

1092
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,819
determined attackers being able to

1093
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:27,000
defeat OB using pass proofing

1094
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,920
and then I'll just end my last slide

1095
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,720
just by re-emphasizing the importance of

1096
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,460
collaboration here I think we've had

1097
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,380
some successes I think Andre already

1098
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,760
called them out so I won't mention them

1099
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,380
again in terms of the collaboration in

1100
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,839
the cloud and CDN provider program

1101
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,400
um and we are looking forward to

1102
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,099
leveraging uh manners

1103
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,500
um as a continuing vehicle for for

1104
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,079
collaboration with the wider industry uh

1105
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,460
with that I will stop and see if there's

1106
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,900
any questions thanks very much

1107
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,880
thank you

1108
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,420
like to provide anybody locally with an

1109
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,319
opportunity to ask questions

1110
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,839
are there any remote questions

1111
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,359
we have somebody in the uh Ben Madison

1112
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:20,460
from work online

1113
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,680
um maybe you could just go back to your

1114
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,859
slide on your rpki origin validation

1115
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:27,480
topology

1116
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,240
um

1117
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,280
it's quite a departure from the kind of

1118
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,720
the normal RTR protocol based approach

1119
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,240
um and whilst it makes sense it's not

1120
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,140
clear to me what motivated the

1121
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,060
the slightly more customized

1122
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,220
architecture you're in a position to

1123
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,680
explain a bit more about why you chose

1124
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,780
to do things that way

1125
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,300
one of our motivations I can say a

1126
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,520
little bit about is that um

1127
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,940
you know RTR represents another feature

1128
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,339
on routers that we have to qualify

1129
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,200
maintain

1130
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,160
um

1131
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,740
evolve on new platforms

1132
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,280
um

1133
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,900
and I think we're very careful about

1134
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,200
introducing uh new features so in this

1135
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,880
architecture we're able to use our

1136
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,319
existing automation

1137
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,380
uh that we have built over Years to you

1138
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,940
know install filters

1139
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,400
um change configurations as needed

1140
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,440
without

1141
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,859
uh introducing a new feature a new

1142
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,900
protocol

1143
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,700
um a new entity that needs to talk

1144
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,079
directly to routers where I think

1145
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,660
there's some uh we perceive as as being

1146
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,060
risky uh as well so this is some of the

1147
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,040
reasons why we went this a little bit

1148
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,540
different approach than the standard RTR

1149
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,700
Baseline

1150
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,480
thank you

1151
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,800
next question I have a few questions for

1152
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,960
remote from remote participants first

1153
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,140
Doug Montgomery asks how do you time out

1154
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,020
the filters that the listening

1155
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,260
layer injects to routers on ROV

1156
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,599
imbalance

1157
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,040
yeah so the way that we're doing that is

1158
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,300
by looking at um again feeds from

1159
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,160
routers that we see so we can still see

1160
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,079
the routes that are being advertised to

1161
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:14,099
us

1162
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:16,619
um and then when we see the invalid

1163
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:20,460
routes being withdrawn or fixed then we

1164
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,339
can remove those those filters if the

1165
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,560
rpti contents change that little route

1166
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,720
becomes

1167
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,359
um vowel that was invalid before we also

1168
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:32,460
respond directly to those changes and

1169
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,339
we'll update Focus accordingly

1170
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,380
no time for one

1171
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,180
next question for Matthew ptech he asks

1172
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,800
but this um you mentioned you push

1173
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,200
updates weekly and Merck invalid

1174
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,359
prefixes for dropping so you provide an

1175
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,819
ability for peers to request a faster

1176
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:51,839
update

1177
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,260
an example if they sign on a new large

1178
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,180
customer who wants traffic to start

1179
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,579
flowing sooner rather than having to

1180
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,140
wait a full week for Google to push out

1181
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,760
new filters

1182
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,380
yeah it's tough for us to do that

1183
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,359
because as I said these updates are

1184
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:08,760
deployed globally so we take a lot of

1185
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,099
care with any sort of global update um

1186
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:14,700
to our uh Edge routers

1187
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,200
um so we can't actually do them faster

1188
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,180
we do have other mechanisms where we can

1189
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,760
install a temporary

1190
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,300
um override or bypass that would

1191
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,560
potentially address the kind of concern

1192
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,060
that SEPTA Pier would have we have run

1193
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,560
into this with peers and we've had to

1194
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,020
explain that you know please make the

1195
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,060
change but it will take a few days um

1196
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,260
for it to roll out it doesn't always

1197
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,540
take a full week but I can take up to

1198
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,180
that long to roll out the shape

1199
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,579
one more question

1200
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:43,319
Blake will assess in terms of data

1201
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,480
hygiene have you had success reaching

1202
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,420
the long tail of smaller providers with

1203
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,359
nasty announcements and bad irr data

1204
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,040
particularly in developing countries

1205
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,800
know the distribution offhand of um sort

1206
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,560
of geographically uh how the hygiene

1207
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,200
looks I mean in general though this the

1208
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,819
smaller networks with a smaller number

1209
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,440
of routes

1210
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,640
um

1211
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,140
let's say a handful of routes that

1212
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,079
they're sending us uh are relatively

1213
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,740
easier I think to get um sorted where we

1214
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,020
have more persistent challenges I think

1215
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,940
are with you know medium to larger size

1216
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,339
networks where uh there's many many

1217
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:26,339
routes that are invalid and and they

1218
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:29,099
um they just don't seem to have uh an

1219
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,839
ability or a motivation

1220
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:31,500
um

1221
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,839
to to fix their routes so I think that's

1222
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,400
where most of this program is I think

1223
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,839
there is that long tail and probably

1224
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:38,819
it's true that in some GEOS it's going

1225
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:40,560
to be harder than others to do that but

1226
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,480
I don't have the distribution offhand

1227
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,839
sorry

1228
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,300
foreign

1229
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:54,240
questions uh folks asking questions uh

1230
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,400
the next speaker in our track is uh

1231
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,960
Frederick korsbach I'd like to introduce

1232
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,260
Frederick he'll be presenting how AWS is

1233
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,280
helping to secure

1234
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,720
internet routing

1235
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,160
um

1236
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,440
Frederick has uh actually been

1237
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,300
passionate about writing security and

1238
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,500
has been part of the internet routing

1239
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,819
security Community for quite some time

1240
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:21,180
working to deploy manners over three

1241
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,660
isps with that Frederick all right thank

1242
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,980
you very much

1243
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,880
foreign

1244
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,359
horseback typically uh known from the

1245
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,460
European scene since I'm from Sweden my

1246
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,079
boring corporate title is senior

1247
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:39,300
infrastructure business developer but I

1248
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,060
typically go with like the bgp guy

1249
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,640
um so as everyone else here is done you

1250
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,060
know we need a network primer there we

1251
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,060
go a map right uh so we can kind of get

1252
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,500
a context of what we're talking about

1253
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,900
here so the AWS Network consists of

1254
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,420
roughly 400 educations globally in the

1255
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,540
world uh we have 87 availability zones

1256
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,940
which then forms the 27 Cloud regions

1257
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,640
which we are currently operating we have

1258
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,700
thousands of routers and we have tens of

1259
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,160
thousands of bgp sessions and we have

1260
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,980
100 million plus ipv4 lessons to protect

1261
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,560
and obviously trillions of gazillions or

1262
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,720
whatever it is in IPv6 addresses right

1263
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,819
so that is kind of the context of what

1264
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,339
we are to talk about today

1265
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:26,700
uh so we start with rpki we can look at

1266
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,520
where are we today uh I have a blog post

1267
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,319
which I wrote a year ago for the kind of

1268
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,119
the full context for the for the dive

1269
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,460
deep stuff but the short ones are that

1270
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,920
we are dropping rpki invalids in 100 of

1271
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,319
our internet budget in over 400 of our

1272
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,960
Global pubs since December 2020. so

1273
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,000
that's you know two years in the making

1274
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,520
so I would say we have signed more than

1275
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,460
99 of our IP space today and we're

1276
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,020
having like a fully automatic robot

1277
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,420
renewal machine or maybe an IP vending

1278
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,339
machine if you may like every internal

1279
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:58,920
team uh that wants to produce anything

1280
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,800
on AWS they need IP addresses right and

1281
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,920
they go to the vending machine of short

1282
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,420
and we take care of the rest for them

1283
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,280
right like we do with irr registrations

1284
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,400
we do the rpki robot registations uh

1285
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,140
you've probably seen that we have a lot

1286
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,859
of

1287
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:15,720
um rolling over with these certificates

1288
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,059
over each other uh so that it's like a

1289
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:19,920
live and kicking system it's not a guy

1290
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,200
that sits in a basement that like emails

1291
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,000
whenever he has time right like this is

1292
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,339
this is this is a fully automatic system

1293
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:28,980
that runs at all times and I also want

1294
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,480
to kind of make sure that you believe

1295
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,180
that is a severity one system like every

1296
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,099
team on AWS that works with the Border

1297
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:37,680
network has on call on this stuff right

1298
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,359
like this is something that people get

1299
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,960
paged on 24 7 if something is wrong and

1300
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,300
unfortunately it goes wrong occasionally

1301
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,099
right like we have projects that is

1302
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:50,339
happening basically now and if we wait

1303
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:51,660
another five minutes there was another

1304
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,119
one right and this is things that people

1305
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:56,760
are looking at at all times as sometimes

1306
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,440
it's even me right even I'm typically

1307
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,839
the hand waving type of guy I also go

1308
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:02,460
down in the trenches to look at this

1309
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,900
stuff

1310
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,760
um so kind of what we ended up with is

1311
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,680
that we have a multi-region distributed

1312
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,740
uh rpki ecosystem as we call it that is

1313
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,540
servicing all generations of our border

1314
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,119
Fabrics like we have a pretty wide I

1315
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,680
would say

1316
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,599
um

1317
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,859
variation of our border like we have the

1318
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:21,619
super new border where you know we we

1319
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:24,059
have the aggregated software and

1320
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:26,099
forwarding planes and we have older more

1321
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:29,220
traditional uh you know monolithic type

1322
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,619
of Border architectures we're servicing

1323
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:35,420
all of that through the same ecosystem

1324
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:37,980
um so kind of what we are doing right

1325
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,140
now so I have six points here of things

1326
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,880
that are happening essentially right now

1327
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,400
that I would like to share with you guys

1328
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,900
uh and the first thing is that we are

1329
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,420
moving over to delegated distributed APK

1330
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,280
Solutions with our own publication

1331
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,400
points so we already have our own repos

1332
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,160
as of about two weeks ago covering APAC

1333
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,020
under the apnic parents and we are

1334
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,520
actively looking and deploying this into

1335
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,280
essentially all regions so Aaron ripe

1336
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,339
everything comes back to us so that we

1337
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:07,079
can take care of kind of how the sausage

1338
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:08,640
is made here

1339
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,099
um since we have been in this game for

1340
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:13,319
quite some time we have been hit by

1341
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:15,300
basically every single outage at the

1342
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,819
rear level that you have read about like

1343
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,400
all of us has generated very angry AWS

1344
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,740
employees and we have a lot of like

1345
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,020
follow-up calls with folks that drive we

1346
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,180
forget Aaron Folks at apnic and we're

1347
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,619
like ah how do we do this how do we

1348
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:30,000
improve how do we get out of this

1349
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,760
problem right and to some extent the

1350
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,680
only way out of this is to take care of

1351
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,180
it yourself right so that is what we're

1352
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,059
doing so what we ended up with here is

1353
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:41,160
something that we build on cloud cloud

1354
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,619
HSM which is our own like HSM solution

1355
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:46,500
where we can uh have the ca going we

1356
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,119
have a global and scalable RC service

1357
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:49,740
which for the one that actually know

1358
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,420
anything about rsync is not very easy

1359
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,540
and the RDP publication is very easy

1360
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,359
since we have a very big CDN which we

1361
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,520
can utilize to publish publicize rdb

1362
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,859
publication points and I guess the thing

1363
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:03,300
I would like to be a call at higher like

1364
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,099
would any of this make sense as external

1365
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:08,040
service like is anyone else looking into

1366
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,960
this would anyone like to have this like

1367
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,520
please find me afterwards it'll just

1368
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,559
discuss over a bear or in the bowling

1369
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:14,700
game

1370
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,760
uh all right next thing byp I'm not sure

1371
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,760
if anyone has like cared about byp but I

1372
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,140
can assure that a lot of service teams

1373
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,079
at the AWS has looked at this many times

1374
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,880
and and um it's actually a pretty

1375
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,700
popular service

1376
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,380
essentially you take your eyepiece bring

1377
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,839
it to the cloud and and build stuff in

1378
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,180
it right however if you ever looked at

1379
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,920
our process and if you ever looked in

1380
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,619
like Global route registries you can

1381
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:43,020
sometimes see traces of a fairly clunky

1382
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,300
process we have it is essentially the

1383
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,400
only process available to us but it's

1384
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,920
not pretty you need to register x509

1385
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,960
search inside routing Registries I need

1386
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,839
to publicize them in whatever routes you

1387
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:56,960
have available so that we can do

1388
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,280
essentially what we're trying to do here

1389
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,059
is to tie IP resource to our AWS user

1390
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:05,640
account today this doesn't exist in the

1391
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,920
rpk ecosystem so we have to do it on the

1392
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,859
outside of it but in like a scalable and

1393
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:13,319
cryptographically sensible Manner and

1394
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:15,119
it's not very pretty so we have been

1395
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,220
looking a lot at ITF kind of what's

1396
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,380
going on there and what what would make

1397
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,420
sense for us here I think we ended up

1398
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,420
with RSC as a future standard that is

1399
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,099
essentially a drop-in replacement what

1400
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:28,800
we're doing today with byp so we are

1401
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,359
super looking forward to that hopefully

1402
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:32,099
we can get a good discussion on that in

1403
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:35,040
November on the next ITF meeting and um

1404
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,740
you know I can't promise that we will be

1405
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,119
the first one to implement it but I'm

1406
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,400
sure uh as long as I can work at this

1407
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,020
company I have at least fight for it so

1408
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,079
that we can be an early adopter here

1409
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,000
um and as I said byp is extremely

1410
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,819
popular we see an increase in users

1411
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,980
basically every day and I don't think

1412
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,720
it's going away

1413
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,420
well number three this is to work with

1414
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,460
and reach out to networks that has rpk

1415
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,380
imbalance to have them fixed

1416
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,140
and like I I have this presentation

1417
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,480
occasionally mostly in Europe uh now

1418
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,819
we're here in the US but this point is

1419
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:10,200
probably going away like we have done

1420
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,359
this for such a long time now that is

1421
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:14,040
not a project anymore like it's not

1422
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,599
something we should do we have already

1423
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,300
reached out two big networks that have

1424
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,359
imbalids they have fixed them or they

1425
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,059
haven't cared about them and if you have

1426
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:26,579
a year of not caring about reaching AWS

1427
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,079
there was probably nothing on those

1428
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,359
slightly prefixes of value right however

1429
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:32,819
those isps might get like a nasty

1430
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:34,380
surprise whenever they turn it on and

1431
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,059
turns out they can't reach anything on

1432
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,319
the internet right

1433
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:40,260
uh to this day we had less than five

1434
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,200
tickets opening total on you know our

1435
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,720
picky invalid routes uh of not being

1436
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,960
able to reach at AWS we have not made

1437
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,520
any exception on any of those tickets

1438
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,500
and obviously some of these tickets has

1439
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,300
been opened by very prolific customers

1440
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,240
but the real solution and really the

1441
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,460
only solution that makes sense for a

1442
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,740
customer to make is to fix the Roa like

1443
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,319
fix the original problem let's not make

1444
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,720
an exception uh that that would probably

1445
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,420
bite someone in the very end you know as

1446
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,460
time goes by

1447
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,619
fourth since we're here talking a little

1448
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:15,780
bit in a manner's context then we would

1449
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,640
like to continue and work a community

1450
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,859
projects such as manners to launch new

1451
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:21,359
initiatives and to Foster the use of

1452
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,480
rpki for us yes as any said before like

1453
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,420
manners is a great uh tool for us a

1454
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,220
great Community for us to use to be able

1455
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,960
to collaborate with others where

1456
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,940
collaboration might be tricky or you

1457
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,460
know not compliant with with what we

1458
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,819
want to do however we obviously there

1459
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:40,140
like a manners is certainly not perfect

1460
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,760
there is things that needs to be done

1461
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,980
and I think one of the things I would

1462
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,780
like to call out here and I will talk

1463
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,000
about a little bit later as well is that

1464
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,200
we would like to welcome a more

1465
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,420
stringent approach to other operators on

1466
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,800
the Europe and bcp38 filtering today we

1467
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,520
have built pretty big sensor networks to

1468
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,160
figure out where does spoof actually

1469
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,800
come in from and it turns out it comes

1470
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,020
in from a lot of places and a lot of

1471
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,960
these places are also manners members

1472
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,079
that says that they are validating The

1473
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:15,720
Source address of networks we have data

1474
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,460
that suggests that is not the case right

1475
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,859
so we need like to do something better

1476
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:21,839
here it could be a mistake or it could

1477
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,220
be you know people are knowing what to

1478
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,859
do or it could be technically not doable

1479
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:28,200
but I think this is this is a place

1480
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,500
where we and with me I mean the Mariners

1481
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,180
Community can do better

1482
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,280
uh so that's why we look forward to for

1483
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,460
example managed plus and and further

1484
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,660
work in these fields and also a little

1485
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,700
bit less cheating from some members

1486
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,880
uh point five this is uh probably a

1487
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,980
delight to vendors in this room and that

1488
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,359
is that we're going to bring our pki

1489
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:51,420
into rfps and rfqs as it would be a

1490
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,980
standard feature like as if it would be

1491
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,859
like r or itv4 or IPv6 which has been

1492
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:58,140
standard features for these type of

1493
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,640
things for a long time

1494
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,099
so we are true strong Believers in the

1495
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:03,619
ecosystem as a whole

1496
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:07,140
and both the things that exist now and

1497
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,720
also things that are coming later right

1498
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,220
so today if you want to be a transfer

1499
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,260
provider to 16509 like you need to have

1500
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,319
rpki support otherwise it's a very low

1501
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,880
chance you will continue to be a trust

1502
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,980
provider or be a new transport ladder

1503
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,900
however it should not stop there like

1504
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,079
equipment vendors OB providers internet

1505
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:27,599
exchange providers and everything in

1506
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,040
between like this will be just a

1507
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,500
universal rule of thumb that we support

1508
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,559
OV and Roi creation and basically

1509
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,420
everything in between whereas will be

1510
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,220
feasible it makes sense

1511
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,660
so this will be a considered a must-have

1512
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,980
feature going forward I would say

1513
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,599
and then we're looking a bit around the

1514
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,339
corner like what happens after this like

1515
00:59:47,339 --> 00:59:48,900
what do we do tomorrow

1516
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,140
so as we talked about RSC that will help

1517
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,260
us greatly in the byp process is

1518
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,940
essentially a drop in replacement for us

1519
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,640
today uh to to make that process

1520
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,460
actually nice for customers to use

1521
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,319
uh next thing would be ask for

1522
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,359
verification like obviously I don't

1523
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:08,160
think I need to talk about this in this

1524
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,140
this environment but it is very easy to

1525
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:13,859
fool rpkiov as it stands today

1526
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:16,020
um so I think aspa is very promising

1527
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,420
draft Insider Ops uh I know there's

1528
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,619
people here in this room that is

1529
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,359
involved with this and and maybe we need

1530
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:22,680
a couple of more people to be involved

1531
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,960
as well and actually get this across the

1532
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,359
Finish Line because I think it has

1533
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,280
stalled a little bit and and some

1534
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,839
conversations we had here over lunch

1535
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:34,020
suggest that that is indeed the case

1536
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,180
um however Aspire is not perfect it is

1537
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,799
unfortunately not solve all the problems

1538
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:39,359
either and it will take us a long time

1539
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,160
together because we need vendor support

1540
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,680
we need support from our ERS we need

1541
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,240
support from

1542
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,339
um software developers that does

1543
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:49,799
software for the rpk ecosystem

1544
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:51,960
but we will get there eventually like

1545
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,400
with enough pressure and everything

1546
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,859
everything bends right

1547
01:00:55,859 --> 01:00:56,460
um

1548
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,339
so what do we do so bjpsec is probably a

1549
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:01,260
word that will make most like old school

1550
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,359
network Engineers like shiver right and

1551
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,520
to some extent it does to me as well

1552
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,980
however there is a couple of good ideas

1553
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,020
there and I think we should also

1554
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,240
remember that bjpsec was made a long

1555
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,540
time ago same with rpki you know five

1556
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,940
years ago everyone was like oh our picci

1557
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,859
that was made like 10 years ago by these

1558
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:21,299
crazy people we shouldn't have any of

1559
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:22,980
that right and I guess that's what we're

1560
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,319
saying now about bjpsec as well but you

1561
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:26,640
know the future is pretty long it's

1562
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,640
actually Infinity long right so like we

1563
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,440
have time to implement this

1564
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,960
so so there's a couple of like small

1565
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,240
initiatives around the world I was in a

1566
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,859
panel a couple of weeks ago together

1567
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:39,299
with Joe Snyders and a couple of other

1568
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:41,819
good friends where we discussed pgp

1569
01:01:41,819 --> 01:01:44,160
second like a mature way it's like what

1570
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,020
do we need from this protocol what can

1571
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,240
we do what is actually achievable right

1572
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,160
and you know there's a lot of networks

1573
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,900
today that are separating the control

1574
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,220
play from the network from the

1575
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,900
forwarding plane quite a lot including

1576
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,940
us and we'll probably be even more as

1577
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,339
time goes by and when you do that and

1578
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:00,540
you have a more distributed control

1579
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:04,319
plane then bgp SEC gets easier

1580
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,859
so I think that in 10 years time I will

1581
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:09,180
hopefully be standing here at this stage

1582
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:12,660
at like non-ug 113. I guess we can have

1583
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,940
that as a as a goal at least and talk

1584
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,819
about AWS implementation of bgp SEC

1585
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:20,880
towards at least a couple of selected

1586
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,760
peers or able networks right

1587
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,839
um

1588
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:27,180
because you know a lot has changed since

1589
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,559
we throw it on the bus the last time so

1590
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,059
let's pick it up on the bus let's look

1591
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:31,920
at it and maybe throw it in again if we

1592
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,380
don't come up with a better plan

1593
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,920
all right next up

1594
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,780
Unsolved Mysteries another put this in

1595
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,160
like these ones because they are not

1596
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,839
technically unsold but it's things that

1597
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:44,700
we need to talk about

1598
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:48,359
first thing is irr fixable uh

1599
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:50,940
so today essentially anyone can pretend

1600
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,700
to be anyone a food error ecosystem the

1601
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,859
board is extremely low here really the

1602
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,119
only thing you need is an email address

1603
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,160
which today is very easy you can

1604
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,020
probably buy it from us for for nothing

1605
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,119
and and I'm sure Google can provide you

1606
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,500
with an email address through pretty you

1607
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,299
see and then you also need an email

1608
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:08,339
client that can write client text this

1609
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:10,380
is hard actually like this is like in

1610
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,760
today's world without look at whatever

1611
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,920
like writing plain text it's not easy

1612
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,619
but if you can solve that as well then

1613
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:18,900
you're in a good spot to pretend to be

1614
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,480
whoever you want and basically steal

1615
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,160
whatever you want on internet and

1616
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,200
unfortunately we've seen a couple of

1617
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,180
cases where this has happened

1618
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,000
uh multiple times in recent history as

1619
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,020
well

1620
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,059
so it is great that you know that we

1621
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,619
have improved over the years for example

1622
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:38,400
with ird4 semantics uh I believe uh job

1623
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,200
Snyder's was here three years ago

1624
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,900
talking about that at this very stage uh

1625
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,839
on on how to improve kind on ird uh

1626
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,359
software side and that's great where we

1627
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:49,920
have authoritative sources like Aaron

1628
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,140
has done a pretty good job here uh with

1629
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:55,740
with um with authenticated Aaron IR data

1630
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,599
and and ripe has always done a good job

1631
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,119
here so this is great but it doesn't

1632
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:02,460
really help if we also take in the

1633
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,380
garbage all the time right like if you

1634
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,420
if you serve steak that's great but if

1635
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,040
you always eat it to get it with garbage

1636
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,900
like it's it's garbage right like that

1637
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,160
doesn't matter if it's wag your steak

1638
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,220
like a so you know we talk about

1639
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,619
these all these important rat objects in

1640
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,780
for example I here I call them LTB and

1641
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,119
Friends these friends would be rich it

1642
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,579
will be maybe level three to some extent

1643
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:25,500
it could be entity it could be Cannery

1644
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,380
there's a whole bunch of these these

1645
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,920
I would say deprecated irr sources

1646
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,420
but how do we get away from that right

1647
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,819
like has anyone actually done the data

1648
01:04:35,819 --> 01:04:37,740
here and actually looked at it

1649
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,839
like do we need all of this stuff

1650
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:42,299
because every single one of these are

1651
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:43,980
already sources is essentially 100

1652
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:46,859
Vector to increase uh the scope of

1653
01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:49,319
e-cities to hijack a company such as

1654
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,359
ours

1655
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,559
um so this is a little bit of like a

1656
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,240
call to action and I really hope that

1657
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,859
someone likes to go up to this mic or

1658
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:57,960
come find me afterwards and comment some

1659
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,720
really good data on this topic

1660
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,240
third part of unsold Mysteries right so

1661
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,760
that would go back to BCP 38 or Source

1662
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,319
address validation or Europe whatever

1663
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:08,700
you want to call it

1664
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,980
said today spoofed volumetric attacks

1665
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,280
using broken UDP services or not maybe

1666
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,440
not even broken like it's just using UDP

1667
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,960
Services it's still I would say the most

1668
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,819
common Vector for launching large-scale

1669
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:22,260
datus attacks

1670
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:24,119
basically everyone in this room probably

1671
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,380
knows this

1672
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:28,619
our triangle triangulation data suggests

1673
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:31,319
that the most most common and effective

1674
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:33,480
way to do this is to originate this

1675
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,640
booth attack over a Transit link from a

1676
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,780
large ISP

1677
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,480
given our peering surface which you know

1678
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,799
stretches

1679
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,359
ten thousand peers or whatever it is

1680
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:44,520
like we have links towards most networks

1681
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,920
in the world we have a fairly easy way

1682
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,319
to add one and two you know we see two

1683
01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:50,940
links we see someone pretending to be

1684
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,859
AWS over here and we see the same

1685
01:05:52,859 --> 01:05:54,900
traffic coming in over here we have a

1686
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,240
fairly good idea of who the bad players

1687
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,319
are

1688
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,319
and we obviously understand that it can

1689
01:06:01,319 --> 01:06:02,940
be hard to solve this especially if

1690
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:05,040
you're a big tier one carrier how do you

1691
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,740
solve this in a sensible way today it's

1692
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,839
really hard essentially the only way

1693
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,359
today is the feasible path with fail

1694
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:13,920
filters which is only available in

1695
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,079
certain vendors

1696
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:17,640
or traditional ACLS which is technically

1697
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,500
available everywhere but can be very

1698
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,359
hard to maintain especially if you build

1699
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,579
it on IR filters which we already

1700
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,339
learned is data right

1701
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:29,099
so this is you know how do we how do we

1702
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:31,319
come back from here how can we scale up

1703
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:33,599
Europe where it makes sense because if

1704
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,819
we get the most impact if we get it from

1705
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:38,700
a large isps instead of instead of

1706
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,200
pushing this to the stubs where it's

1707
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,420
easy implementable but perhaps not very

1708
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,220
effective

1709
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:46,879
foreign

1710
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:53,039
I guess this is essentially two

1711
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,920
different things but it's it's like we

1712
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,240
probably need two solutions to the same

1713
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,880
problem here so today it is really hard

1714
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,180
to do rpki origin validation and or to

1715
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,980
and allow r2bh at the same time

1716
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,440
essentially what we see today is that

1717
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,240
the origin validation part is just

1718
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,619
skipped if r2bh is offered right

1719
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:16,559
um and it's not very good like to to

1720
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,359
register like robust that allow up to

1721
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:20,880
slash 32 because then you're essentially

1722
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,000
then OV is basically not really it

1723
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,220
doesn't work for you right

1724
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,140
um so there's really not a good solution

1725
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:30,539
here uh one of the things I've been

1726
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:32,280
looking at at least is what we call

1727
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,400
today rpki DOA uh one of the authors is

1728
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,020
here actually back in the audience I see

1729
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,520
and it's something that you know we're

1730
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,960
keeping an eye out to see if this could

1731
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,579
be a potential to solution to the

1732
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:43,740
problem we have because we actually use

1733
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,619
r3h occasionally so we would like to

1734
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:48,839
have that option for

1735
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:51,240
you know primary big tier one carriers

1736
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:55,079
to accept rtbh black holes from us while

1737
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:57,480
doing OV at the same time because today

1738
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,240
that is not really doable

1739
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,400
um today I guess this is a somewhat

1740
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,660
controversial topic or at least

1741
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,640
something that I think we get the most

1742
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:09,000
questions about is that we do produce uh

1743
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,980
roas today with pretty permissive max

1744
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,260
length and this is to be able to do

1745
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,299
Ingress te for us so traffic engineering

1746
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,580
on the Ingress side like we have load

1747
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:19,259
balancer which automatically Cuts

1748
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:21,299
prefixes in half and sends them out over

1749
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:23,160
two links if we detect that someone is

1750
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,899
is blasting us too hard

1751
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:26,100
so

1752
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,279
so you know would we ever reach a a

1753
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,738
place in time where we could get like a

1754
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:33,660
robot convergence time to be less than

1755
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:34,738
10 minutes

1756
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:36,960
like in general at least because that

1757
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,819
would be kind of where we are today with

1758
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:41,399
our Ingress team mechanics and where we

1759
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:42,660
would probably like to be in the future

1760
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:46,020
if we kind of change this right or if

1761
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,698
there's any other solution to this

1762
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:49,198
problem right because we need to have

1763
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:52,380
the possibility to to to maintain our

1764
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:58,080
like slash 14 12 16 announcements uh but

1765
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,640
still have the possibility to split a

1766
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,439
couple of them up to to do Ingress te

1767
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,719
because I don't think that anyone is in

1768
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:05,819
this room would be very happy if we

1769
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:08,279
de-aggregate all of our space because

1770
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:10,020
today it's roughly two for ten percent

1771
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,960
of the V4 internet and and giving that

1772
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,640
to AS Slash 24s which is you know a

1773
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,839
pretty good solution right in general

1774
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:21,540
but not that ours at our scale I think

1775
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,040
that we will be cooking a lot of routers

1776
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,500
out there and I think that's very good

1777
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,839
uh that is kind of what I had and I'm

1778
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,939
actually at second which I'm pretty

1779
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:31,380
proud of so I'm happy to take questions

1780
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,339
on this topic

1781
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:37,920
or yeah you can also find me you know uh

1782
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,620
on the rpki Discord or on IRC

1783
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:49,738
hey Warren Kamari Google hi and also

1784
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:51,839
ietf operations ID

1785
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:56,040
so you mentioned the ITF ciderups rpki

1786
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,500
RSC draft and that you hooked would come

1787
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,120
out soon

1788
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,100
um it's actually in the RFC editor queue

1789
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,980
so no need to discuss it in London and

1790
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,660
it should be out soon

1791
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,679
thank you very much we're looking

1792
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,219
forward to that

1793
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,600
is a question from a remote attendee

1794
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,780
Matthew Peter I guess pure term number

1795
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,239
four are you proposing to name and shame

1796
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:21,420
isps who claim compliance with manners

1797
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:24,300
action 2 but really aren't or do you

1798
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,739
have some different proposal for

1799
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:29,820
actually giving matters some real teeth

1800
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,159
yeah I mean I don't think that we are

1801
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:33,540
generally in the business of name and

1802
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,520
shaming at least not in an official

1803
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,000
setting uh but but uh in an unofficial

1804
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,140
setting I think that's a very

1805
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,320
interesting idea uh and and how we have

1806
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,300
been addressing it this like right now

1807
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,460
is that we've been talking directly with

1808
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,320
isps at hand it's like hey guys we

1809
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,620
actually see you do this and you know if

1810
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,760
you want to keep those bearing sessions

1811
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,679
alive right like let's get some stuff

1812
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,420
fixed right if we believe that it is

1813
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,620
even fixable

1814
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,120
I think that is that is kind of the

1815
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,500
answer to that question

1816
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,360
you have a mic over there

1817
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,340
um Ben Madison from work come on again

1818
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:08,100
um as Warren said the RSC document is

1819
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,480
pretty much ready to come out of the

1820
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,159
sausage machine

1821
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:11,880
um

1822
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,280
if it's something that's of interest to

1823
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,620
people then the most helpful thing that

1824
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,659
people can do at this stage is speak to

1825
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:21,659
their rir and ask them to crack on with

1826
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:24,120
implementation because the draft on its

1827
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,340
own without a implementation at the rars

1828
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:29,520
is of questionable value

1829
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,360
I agree

1830
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,219
thank you Frederick all right thank you

1831
01:11:38,219 --> 01:11:40,460
very much

1832
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,640
[Applause]

1833
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,800
so our next talk is entitled building

1834
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,320
reliable rpki infrastructure for

1835
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,179
large-scale networks and protecting

1836
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:53,460
networks against DDOS

1837
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:56,340
samesh chaturmota is a principal

1838
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,199
software engineering manager at Mike in

1839
01:11:58,199 --> 01:12:00,060
the Microsoft Global networking team

1840
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,679
he's responsible for managing the

1841
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,020
Microsoft Edge Network and he has been

1842
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,520
leading the Microsoft Edge networking

1843
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,500
team for more than three years and has

1844
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,060
more than 15 years of experience

1845
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,219
building various software-defined

1846
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:12,659
Network controllers for cloud scale

1847
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:14,760
networks with that we'd like to welcome

1848
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,420
sumesh

1849
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,659
[Applause]

1850
01:12:20,659 --> 01:12:23,159
hi I'm sumesh I'm the engineering

1851
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:25,380
manager for the edge team Edge not the

1852
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,060
browser The Edge the network which

1853
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,040
connects to the rest of the internet

1854
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,100
uh I joined the edge team about five

1855
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,020
years ago and then started leading this

1856
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,440
team you know three years ago and uh I

1857
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,640
don't come from the networking

1858
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,500
background so a lot of Team Network

1859
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,900
engineers in my team hate me for you

1860
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,780
know trying to simplify the network and

1861
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,780
you know it's been uh the challenge

1862
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:52,340
which we've been up to for a long time

1863
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,219
uh how to make the network scale for the

1864
01:12:56,219 --> 01:13:00,900
cloud and uh I'm gonna talk about how

1865
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,600
at Microsoft we have solved some of

1866
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,000
these challenges about routing and

1867
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,600
traffic security

1868
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,199
okay so this is the slide which

1869
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,820
everybody is presenting so I'm also

1870
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:18,060
going to present this slide uh uh it's

1871
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,280
one of the largest Network in the world

1872
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,920
like you know we have 60 plus Azure

1873
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,940
regions

1874
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:27,120
uh we have our own dark fiber connecting

1875
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,719
most of our Azure regions today

1876
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:35,159
uh operating 190h Network pops uh 200

1877
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:37,500
Express out partners and numbers are

1878
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,960
there for you to see on the screen

1879
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,760
but

1880
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,460
it's really that scale of this network

1881
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:47,000
becomes much bigger when you talk about

1882
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,719
the kind of the routing database we have

1883
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,640
every routers we have in the network is

1884
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,219
producing large amount of routing

1885
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:59,520
database for us to validate and when I

1886
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,460
joined this team I was given a task to

1887
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:05,820
you know improve the routing hijack and

1888
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,560
you know we had couple of incidents

1889
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:10,320
which were pretty impactful at Microsoft

1890
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,840
uh

1891
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,400
related to uh Microsoft's routes getting

1892
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,020
hijacked on the internet

1893
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:18,719
and uh you know by Journey in 2018

1894
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,420
started to build a system called we call

1895
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:24,060
it as radar uh which stands for routing

1896
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,880
route anomaly detection and Remediation

1897
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,820
so we took a different approach

1898
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,560
collecting the data from the router and

1899
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,480
whenever somebody will hijack Microsoft

1900
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,780
route we will launch our own route to

1901
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,520
get the traffic back and you know this

1902
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,719
is the advantage you get with the large

1903
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:41,040
scale Network because we have so many

1904
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,020
peers with the very first announcement

1905
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,699
itself will take the entire traffic back

1906
01:14:44,699 --> 01:14:47,460
back to Microsoft and we built that

1907
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:50,040
system uh you know then we kind of

1908
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,620
looked at it and say okay we can use

1909
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:55,380
this thing to also detect the internet

1910
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:58,560
routes at Microsoft and we put some

1911
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,260
relationships and the Machine learning

1912
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,239
actually it is the system which is kind

1913
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:05,880
of learning on its own of how the

1914
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,400
network relationships are evolving

1915
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,620
and then still giving us the large

1916
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:13,580
amount of right data on how to filter

1917
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:17,580
the internet route at Microsoft

1918
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:21,900
but then uh as you can see uh we needed

1919
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:25,860
something to be proactive radar was

1920
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,960
reactive even though our mitigation type

1921
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,640
was two minutes you know we will get the

1922
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,159
data the bgb propagates very fast we get

1923
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:35,040
the data very fast but still

1924
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,500
we needed something to do proactive and

1925
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:42,420
in 2020 we created roast for most of the

1926
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,980
Microsoft routes as you can see on the

1927
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:47,760
top of the screen uh that but you know

1928
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,820
it took us some time to also uh you know

1929
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,800
get the Roa system up to date because we

1930
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,900
had to manage routes across multiple

1931
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,040
registries

1932
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,320
and you know with multiple Registries

1933
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,360
everybody has different apis and

1934
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,120
different kind of renewal policy and I

1935
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,940
actually did talk about it in a one of

1936
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,920
the banners blog that hey how each and

1937
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,500
every Registries can come together to

1938
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,600
solve the common problem of managing the

1939
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,340
roast

1940
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:18,300
uh and then uh after 2020 we actually

1941
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,699
did not see a hijack which is impactful

1942
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:23,760
so touchwood we've been uh there with

1943
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,440
the rpki and this is one of the things

1944
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,719
which I give it back to the manners

1945
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:29,159
community

1946
01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:32,520
uh you know the rpki implementation rpk

1947
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,620
signing of our routes has really really

1948
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,260
protected the Microsoft network very

1949
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,300
well on the internet

1950
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,780
and we then took it saying that hey we

1951
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:46,199
will also Implement APK filtering inside

1952
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:48,300
the Microsoft network

1953
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,580
and again we started building the the

1954
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:51,260
the

1955
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:54,239
rpki filtering on our network but then

1956
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:57,239
we ran into multiple issues both with

1957
01:16:57,239 --> 01:16:59,940
the vendors as well as with the irrs and

1958
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,159
you know all the common problems which

1959
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,920
others talked about we ran into the same

1960
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,960
issues building the rpki filtering

1961
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,679
system but finally in 2022 this year

1962
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:12,420
itself we have implemented rpki

1963
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:16,260
filtering across our Network

1964
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:19,679
so uh building uh I talk about the

1965
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,239
building the reliable rpki

1966
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:22,920
infrastructure system so I'll talk about

1967
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,420
the challenges

1968
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:27,659
uh as we started deploying rpk filtering

1969
01:17:27,659 --> 01:17:30,420
we ran into issues one of them the

1970
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:33,360
common one is the bgp route propagation

1971
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,600
is faster than the Rua propagation

1972
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,620
people will sign their routes and then

1973
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:43,440
straight away announced the bgp the bgp

1974
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,840
still thinks it's invalid Roa hasn't

1975
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,699
come to the system yet

1976
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:50,460
how do you do this thing people change

1977
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:53,940
as numbers on the bgp routes

1978
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,640
similar issues they happen they commonly

1979
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,159
happen and we have seen the amount of

1980
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:02,159
churn which was happening on our routers

1981
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:05,219
when we started putting just on a pilot

1982
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:07,980
router we just put it on a pilot router

1983
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,640
believe me crashed so

1984
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,260
yeah it was it was pretty crazy to see

1985
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,820
the amount of data coming in from the

1986
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,679
router and then what was going on so we

1987
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:18,239
have to look at it

1988
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:23,820
of how uh to make it really work for our

1989
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,560
scale of our Network Microsoft network

1990
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,020
is pretty large Network I actually the

1991
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,600
the link on the the presentation is

1992
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,860
about

1993
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,140
what we want this problem which we have

1994
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:37,080
solved at Microsoft IRS can solve this

1995
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,199
thing irrs can solve this problem to

1996
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:42,960
make sure that when people are managing

1997
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,659
row us they do not

1998
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:49,080
commit simple mistakes

1999
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:52,140
so what we did inside the Microsoft of

2000
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,800
course we took the control plane and

2001
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,420
data plane together

2002
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:00,300
with the radar we know the routing data

2003
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,400
plane inside the router

2004
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,600
and we get the data from all the

2005
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,860
registries

2006
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,320
then we filter it to make sure that we

2007
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,600
are not missing any data we you know

2008
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,900
perform the BVT or basic validation test

2009
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,480
on those ones then we run some extensive

2010
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,780
test before we give this feed to the

2011
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:22,739
router

2012
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:25,020
and once you get the feed to the routers

2013
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,780
the routers are pretty stable that they

2014
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:30,840
can perform the rowa validation but this

2015
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,900
has really helped us to protect against

2016
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:37,860
large outages remember internet was born

2017
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,440
30 years ago and it has become the bgp

2018
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:44,100
has become stable in 30 years rpki is a

2019
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,100
new system it will go through its own

2020
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,360
challenges

2021
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:51,300
the systems has to get mature and more

2022
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,140
stable

2023
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:55,380
and this is where we think that as we

2024
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:58,739
look at the the future of the the rpki

2025
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:02,219
and row of validation we think that the

2026
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:03,540
irrs can

2027
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,880
put the data plane data

2028
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,400
merge with the control plane and really

2029
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,980
improve the Rua management

2030
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,820
you will never have a bgp propagation

2031
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,460
slower than the the rawas will take time

2032
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,860
as somebody will manage like you know

2033
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,679
it's a protocol which is take it's meant

2034
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:23,760
to take time

2035
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,739
so that's why it is very important that

2036
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:28,440
the IRS can take the first step on

2037
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,420
solving some of this problem they have

2038
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:33,500
the data on the routing data plane

2039
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,100
anyways

2040
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,500
ah Shifting the gear a little bit more

2041
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,480
and I think we're gonna run out of time

2042
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:42,000
uh this is one of the top challenges

2043
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,820
which we are facing as of now I think we

2044
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:47,219
think that with manners and you know

2045
01:20:47,219 --> 01:20:49,800
with the community coming together on

2046
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,060
the rpki routing data is is is protected

2047
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,739
to the large extent

2048
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:59,880
however the traffic is the next

2049
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,800
challenge

2050
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,140
the data on the screen is from the

2051
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,440
manners you know we see a lot and lot of

2052
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,300
DDOS attacks

2053
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,480
lot and lot of DDOS attacks coming in

2054
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:17,640
which we think is caused by spoofing

2055
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,360
and it is very easy to do this kind of

2056
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,400
attacks

2057
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,940
however it is also very easy to protect

2058
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:30,300
against this kind of attacks

2059
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:34,140
you know uh when during the covert time

2060
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:37,080
frame uh we saw a sudden increase in the

2061
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,900
DDOS coming in and

2062
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,659
we had to all of us we had to struggle

2063
01:21:42,659 --> 01:21:44,280
to get the capacity we were all

2064
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,500
struggling to get the capacity and we

2065
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,360
were deploying capacity as we speak but

2066
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,880
we are also dealing with the DDOS we

2067
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,520
took some hard measures to

2068
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,100
protect the network against the DDOS

2069
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,260
attacks

2070
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,520
uh

2071
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,560
but as I said uh

2072
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:07,860
Frederick mentioned about the the BCP 38

2073
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:11,600
or urpf we have actually started now

2074
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,840
deploying urpf in our Network because we

2075
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,540
think that in order to protect the

2076
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:19,440
internet

2077
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,860
the Internet Security relies on us

2078
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,320
taking the next level measure of

2079
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,120
implementing urpf

2080
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,420
just like rpki we are deploying this in

2081
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,040
what-if mode

2082
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:35,580
but as we go and we think within a year

2083
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,400
or two time frame this is my first

2084
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,440
analog and oh this is my newcomer batch

2085
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,960
so I'll be here in next two three years

2086
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,179
and talking about this that we have

2087
01:22:45,179 --> 01:22:48,380
implemented inside the Microsoft network

2088
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:53,640
uh a urpf and really uh we had the

2089
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,620
hardware vendors providing different set

2090
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,360
of features you know in the feasible

2091
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,060
mode and with the field fast filters so

2092
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,120
on so forth but really it is the way to

2093
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,940
protect the spoofing

2094
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,040
which will be the one of the biggest

2095
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:12,420
challenges internet has to solve and not

2096
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,840
only we have to solve

2097
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:18,179
but we think the community needs to

2098
01:23:18,179 --> 01:23:22,260
solve and by sole reason for coming here

2099
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,480
to the stage is to basically ask the

2100
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,540
community to look at this and say that

2101
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:32,520
yes we have to protect the spoofing on

2102
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,600
the network

2103
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,300
the systems of traffic engineering has

2104
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:40,260
to evolve to adhere to spoofing

2105
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:43,679
and we expect that we will deploy the

2106
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,860
urpf in the extensible or the feasible

2107
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:47,880
mode

2108
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,400
which allows you to engineer the traffic

2109
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,739
inside the Microsoft network

2110
01:23:52,739 --> 01:23:55,739
however it cannot be that your routing

2111
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,239
plane data

2112
01:23:57,239 --> 01:24:01,739
and your traffic data does not match we

2113
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:05,159
will make sure that you have the routing

2114
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:07,260
plane data always matches with the

2115
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:09,360
traffic data it might not be the best

2116
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,400
path we control the policy in our

2117
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:14,760
Network however it has to have the data

2118
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,020
without that we don't think so that the

2119
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,780
the network which is facing its next

2120
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:24,600
challenge you know uh five years ago it

2121
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,400
was the the graph I showed you in the

2122
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,739
second slide was the every day it's a

2123
01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:30,600
hijack it's a hijack or a few things

2124
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,340
going on and you know some are

2125
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:35,040
intentional some are done through the

2126
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,860
mistakes and most of them after the

2127
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:39,420
claim they came to be the mistake but

2128
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:42,420
you know uh we have overcome that

2129
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,280
problem we think that the internet

2130
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:47,340
Community together has made a tremendous

2131
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:49,500
progress in solving the pgp security

2132
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,620
problem or a route hijack problem but

2133
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,840
this one is the next

2134
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,760
in front of us and I think if we can

2135
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,940
solve this within the community of how

2136
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,159
that the spoofing should be prevented

2137
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:05,280
you know simply many networks can deploy

2138
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,500
outbound actual policy that's an easy

2139
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,320
one to do it but even if you're getting

2140
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,360
a traffic from someone and then goes

2141
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,280
back to the last Transit providers or

2142
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,780
the large networks if you're appearing

2143
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:17,780
with the large set of Networks

2144
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:20,100
your customer routes you should be able

2145
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,900
to filter it and make sure that the

2146
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,420
traffic is only coming from them

2147
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:25,620
because

2148
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,320
it's the next Vector which people are

2149
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,640
exploiting

2150
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,540
on the internet

2151
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:37,199
with that uh I want to say thank you uh

2152
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:41,219

year and then thank you on behalf of

2154

2161
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:01,080
over the years have eroded on the

2162
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,719
internet it has to come back and it has

2163
01:26:03,719 --> 01:26:06,360
to start from this set of people who can

q a oh yeah please

2177
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:44,460
hi uh Tony Tauber Comcast thanks to you

2178
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:46,440
and all the presenters for sharing the

2179
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:49,679
excellent uh content uh about the radar

2180
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,920
thing that you had the sanity check for

2181
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:57,120
rpki information how many um if you can

2182
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,520
say how many cases were there where you

2183
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,560
actually had you know it detected

2184
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:03,120
something that would have caused some

2185
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,440
kind of average

2186
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,940
uh

2187
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:09,000
I think we had uh in the last two months

2188
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,739
we had couple of incidents because I

2189
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:12,900
don't have the data pass in last two

2190
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,639
months we had couple of incidents where

2191
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,580
the feed just went away and I think

2192
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,520
there was a famous incident back in 2021

2193
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,159
if I'm not mistaken from the TW Nick

2194
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:26,880
about a lot of routes becoming invalid I

2195
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,980
think that was protected by the system

2196
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:32,159
in fortunately it did not install those

2197
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:34,320
roas on the router and that was the

2198
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,900
really issue which we saw which kind of

2199
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,820
made us to think saying no it cannot

2200
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,520
just be that whatever is sent to us and

2201
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,199
you have to filter it out make sure that

2202
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:46,620
things are correct you know you have to

2203
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:48,000
understand that this is a new protocol

2204
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,460
so it will take some time to mature so

2205
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:51,780
that's why we had couple of incidents

2206
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:54,179
where we saw the basic ventilation test

2207
01:27:54,179 --> 01:27:55,260
failing

2208
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:57,000
of course our basic validation test

2209
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,219
includes our own signed routes coming

2210
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:01,820
back to us

2211
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,580
hi uh Danny McPherson air signs quick

2212
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:11,460
question on uh urpf are you doing strict

2213
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,920
mode or loose mode yeah we cannot do

2214
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,600
lose mode I think the loose mode

2215
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,199
now and I'll be you know honest with you

2216
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:25,199
we but we are doing extensible which is

2217
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,880
little bit more than

2218
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,000
uh is between the you strict and the

2219
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,940
loose it's been between where we want it

2220
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,820
will not be the FIB it will be dictated

2221
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:39,120
by the rib but rib on the interface not

2222
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:43,460
on the router okay thank you

2223
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,300
that's it thank you very much

2224
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:55,728
