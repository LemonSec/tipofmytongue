1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,060
[Music]

2
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,210
foreign

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,480
[Music]

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,980
this is a lightning talk

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,400
uh Kenneth yeah there you are ICU we met

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,300
yesterday

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,759
um so Kenneth Finnegan will be here or

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,340
is here to

9
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,880
talk about serving security updates to

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,460
every Linux server in the world

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,900
this could be longer than 10 minutes

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,460
kind of but that's all you have yeah I'm

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,140
gonna have to be quick all right thank

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,699
you very much so welcome Kenneth thank

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,180
you very much

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,500
because

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,660
all right let's see all right great all

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,100
right and then there we go all right so

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,559
my name is Kenneth Finnegan um I my day

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,000
job is I work at Arista networks and

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,860
support but probably more of you know me

22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,840
as one of the benevolent dictators for

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,539
the Fremont cabal internet exchange

24
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,460
um and I'm gonna be talking to you today

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,579
about Linux mirrors so

26
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,500
just to double click for one second on

27
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,840
what a Linux distro means and what we

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,940
mean when we say a mirror

29
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,280
um every Linux distribution is starting

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,500
with the same repository of source code

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,700
right everyone starts with the same

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,799
Linux kernel source code everyone starts

33
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,840
with the same LibreOffice code everyone

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,780
starts with the same gnome

35
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,060
repos and the difference between every

36
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,299
separate Linux distribution is that they

37
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,540
decide how they're going to compile how

38
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,799
they're going to build each of these

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,659
software packages together how they're

40
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,340
going to package them and then how

41
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,259
they're going to ship them to their

42
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,020
users and what policies and procedures

43
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,939
and what is kind of

44
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,000
umbrella termed release engineering that

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,340
they then you know ship it and that's

46
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,200
what makes Arch Linux different from

47
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,320
Centos right and so when someone when

48
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,180
any application developer picks one

49
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,280
Linux distribution they're really more

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,720
interested than anything else in

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
specifically what does this distribution

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,740
do differently from a release

53
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,100
engineering effective relative to any

54
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,479
other Linux distribution that's building

55
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,340
off the same code right so that's that's

56
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,600
what we talk about when we're talking

57
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,720
about a Linux distribution so the Linux

58
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,000
distribution is responsible to somehow

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,799
either through donations or fundraising

60
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,919
or a support model or some you know

61
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,900
someone with a big checkbook they set up

62
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,720
their build Farm to compile all of their

63
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,879
packages they sign them they Master

64
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,959
these disk images container images and

65
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,120
packages and then that's what everyone

66
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,599
downloads for incredibly small projects

67
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,879
they may just have one what was what

68
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,220
would be called a tier zero server that

69
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,660
everyone would download the files from

70
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,660
unfortunately downloading all the files

71
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,040
from a single Server doesn't work very

72
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,920
well and so given that Linux

73
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,200
distributions don't have a budget for a

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,800
CDN given that they're free and so no

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,080
one's paying them to build these large

76
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,760
content distribution networks to ship

77
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,300
updates those the responsibility of

78
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,420
Hosting all of their produced artifacts

79
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,540
and serving them to the thousands or

80
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,540
millions of users falls on groups of

81
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,540
volunteers right and so they the the

82
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,580
project themselves produce one golden

83
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,340
copy of all of their artifacts

84
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,739
um dozens or hundreds of volunteer

85
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,340
servers would on a regular basis every

86
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,400
few hours copy do a differential copy to

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,659
update themselves to what the latest

88
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,440
golden image is and then ultimately the

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,260
thousands or millions of package manager

90
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,940
clients would query them for is there a

91
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,379
newer version of the software I have

92
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,140
installed that I should install instead

93
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,420
and so what we're talking about here is

94
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,480
the community mirrors which are how the

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,940
Linux distribution scale horizontally to

96
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,159
be able to serve their sometimes

97
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,860
incredibly large install bases so who

98
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,799
runs these mirrors

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,659
um traditionally and canonically it was

100
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,120
primarily academic institutions right

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,920
universities someone in the Cs

102
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,140
Department would feel strongly about

103
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,319
their BSD of choice or Linux and they

104
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,599
would put together some hardware and

105
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,599
they would set up a mirror and or and

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,819
then they would be one of the kind of

107
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,879
pillars of supporting the Linux

108
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,399
distributions for all the users the

109
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,478
second group of people that would do it

110
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,579
would be Linux user groups right and so

111
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,139
these are the clubs of people that use

112
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,880
the Linux distribution that feel

113
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,199
strongly about it and so they would set

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,300
up a server to host either their one

115
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,340
Linux distribution of choice or more

116
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,240
often than not several you know 6 12 20

117
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,740
different distributions on the one

118
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,720
server and then the third category in

119
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,460
digital ocean actually is a great

120
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,919
example of this generous isps that have

121
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,680
a spare engineering resources would out

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,300
of the goodness of their heart set up

123
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,259
these servers and host updates

124
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:50,580
digitalocean is I think one of the most

125
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,040
notable ones for they Point all of their

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,560
internal droplets at internal mirrors

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,660
they run themselves which is why if you

128
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,240
ever run apt update on a on a digital

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
ocean droplet it's so much faster than

130
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,160
it is anywhere else

131
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,780
the issue and kind of what I want to

132
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,160
bring to everyone's attention here is

133
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,580
that these pillars of the load-bearing

134
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,560
Linux distr mirror infrastructure these

135
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,780
universities are

136
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,540
kind of very quietly and subtly on the

137
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,800
decline

138
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,620
um go go to go find any uh network

139
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,479
engineer here that is working at a

140
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,160
university and ask them about their five

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,680
or two year plan to move out of all

142
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,020
their data center space on campus

143
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,520
um is unfortunately a whole lot of the

144
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,100
universities are getting pressure from

145
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,280
up high from management to vacate their

146
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,820
data center space and move as much as

147
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,520
they can up into the cloud and these

148
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,220
want weird boxes that are one-third of

149
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,320
their egress traffic

150
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,860
um

151
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,440
that you know the guy that set it up has

152
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,720
either retired or died

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,300
um tends to just get the cord yanked and

154
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,860
that's the end of that University being

155
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,900
in the mirror system

156
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,280
and so

157
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,320
back at the beginning of the year uh one

158
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,020
of my cohorts in the cabal

159
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,539
um wardy nine on Twitter uh John Hawley

160
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:10,680
in real life

161
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,360
um we were discussing man like you know

162
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,699
we we need more projects in our life we

163
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,020
don't have too many balls up in the air

164
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,479
and so we went and spent several

165
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,660
thousand dollars building a 2ru box with

166
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,360
96 terabytes of hard drives in it to

167
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,539
start hosting as much Linux as we could

168
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,060
um they for us the fondy model was I

169
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,979
posted about it on Twitter

170
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,440
um and entertained our my followers with

171
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,780
the shenanigans we got into

172
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,600
um and then we started serving about 10

173
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,380
to 15 terabytes a day of traffic off of

174
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,159
this one box

175
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,100
and then we started graphing it

176
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,139
um because I mean what what is a whole

177
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,220
bunch of traffic without a bunch of

178
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,560
pretty graphs analyzing that traffic and

179
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,660
so we built a whole influx and grafana

180
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,060
Pipeline and then we were able to Pivot

181
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,819
all of our this traffic and requests by

182
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,699
which project was it what as's were

183
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,979
requesting it and kind of one of the

184
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,720
first things that jumped out at us is

185
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,520
huh

186
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
a whole bunch of the traffic is coming

187
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,960
from some of the smallest folders

188
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,940
right because when you're a mirror you

189
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,680
need to carry all of that project's

190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
artifacts locally

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,960
um is the kind of thin front end caching

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,539
doesn't work very well with Linux

193
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,599
distribution repos and so the fact that

194
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,800
Ubuntu they're isos the just just their

195
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,680
isos is about a 25 gigabyte folder and

196
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,139
over the span of a week we serve 14

197
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,680
terabytes of just those 25 gigabytes

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,360
worth of files

199
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,400
um made us realize that while we spent

200
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,620
about four thousand dollars on this big

201
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,160
2ru that took a lot of planning and has

202
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,020
a ton of hard drives and a ton of ram in

203
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,620
it we realized that if you pick the

204
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,900
right projects you can make a

205
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,139
proportionally larger impact with fewer

206
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,020
resources dedicated to it as we realize

207
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,360
that if we cut the cost to about 10

208
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,220
percent all right and so if we only

209
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,960
spend two or three or four hundred

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
dollars on a server we can serve

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,840
something like 30 to 60 percent of the

212
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,000
impact of one of these larger mirrors so

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,400
the micromere project was born and so

214
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,979
this was us realizing that while we can

215
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,680
take one big server and place it in

216
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,259
Fremont California and we can be you

217
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,899
know a nominally large impact on Linux

218
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,839
distributions if we instead take a 25

219
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,899
Thin Client off of eBay because we don't

220
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,599
care if it fails because there is 200 of

221
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,940
these servers online we buy a two

222
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,540
terabyte used SSD on eBay because we

223
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,220
don't care if it fails because there's

224
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,339
200 of these servers and we find someone

225
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,080
somewhere who's willing to plug this

226
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,959
thing in for us we can sit there and

227
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,240
serve about one third of the traffic is

228
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
our four thousand dollar server for ten

229
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,019
percent of the cost

230
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,440
and so we started deploying these things

231
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,980
um

232
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,380
and then as we started digging into it

233
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,260
more we kind of realized wow like this

234
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,120
is something that like like the fact

235
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,279
that I'm able to deploy these and start

236
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,500
actually kind of a notably positive

237
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,120
impact on Linux distribution

238
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
infrastructure right now

239
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,220
is a little bit scary because it means

240
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,420
that

241
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,000
there was a lot of low-hanging fruit to

242
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,560
be made there

243
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,899
and so what I wanted to kind of talk

244
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,779
about in this lightning talk is that

245
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,620
um the the traditional institutions the

246
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,480
universities that were hosting all of

247
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,620
these main what we call tier one mirrors

248
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,180
which are the bigger ones that were more

249
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,279
reliable that other mirrors fed off of

250
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,140
they're going away

251
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,899
right and so our personal project that

252
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,180
you know the two of us are working on is

253
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,820
we're looking for sites to put micro

254
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,320
mirrors we're you know looking for

255
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,080
funding but we're just two people and

256
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,300
that's not really what matters here

257
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,220
um what I want to talk to all of you

258
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,560
guys about and get everyone else in this

259
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,560
conference thinking about is

260
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,140
how can you be hosting a mirror yourself

261
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,899
right because I think that if you know

262
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,839
the the problem with these mirrors

263
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,740
is that for a normal developer someone

264
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,080
that runs Linux at home or someone that

265
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,899
runs Linux in Virtual machines the idea

266
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,320
of serving 15 terabytes a day from a

267
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,200
single server is terrifying that is a

268
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,300
huge number

269
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,120
right for those normal citizens that

270
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,620
sounds really hard

271
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,560
in this room any of us would look at 15

272
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,240
terabytes a day and I think the

273
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,980
technical term for that is a rounding

274
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,180
error

275
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,740
and so

276
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,920
any if any network operators here have

277
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,380
lots of surplus bandwidth it's something

278
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,600
to think about that could you host

279
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,940
somewhere in your network a Linux mirror

280
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,339
to contribute back to kind of the open

281
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,560
source projects

282
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,560
and the community that has kind of made

283
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,600
like not only networking but like the

284
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,760
whole internet and you know all of the

285
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,380
things that we move across the network

286
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,500
so so much more possible right and the

287
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,820
ways that you do it I think there's

288
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,519
there's value and diversity there right

289
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,920
and so whether it's go find a local

290
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,740
Linux user group and say hey if you guys

291
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,800
organize a server that we can drop into

292
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,860
2ru in our data center somewhere and you

293
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,079
let the lug manage it and then you guys

294
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,880
provide the space and power and Transit

295
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,100
that's a model if you're looking to get

296
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,399
some of your Junior Engineers sysops or

297
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,279
devops experience about how do we deploy

298
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,620
and manage a Linux server in a network

299
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,600
environment this is an incredibly good

300
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,640
way to do it and you start learning all

301
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,740
these lessons about huh what happens

302
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,839
when I start having to actually serve

303
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,480
thousands of requests at once

304
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,519
from one box right and it's valuable

305
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,560
lessons that fold back into all these

306
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,440
Automation and coding and

307
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,540
um kind of all of these extra things

308
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,640
that we talk about and we want Network

309
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,320
Engineers to stop being iOS CLI monkeys

310
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,339
um this is an excellent venue for us to

311
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,620
start you know kind of it's a low

312
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,140
priority scavenger class project that

313
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,480
you can start contributing and making

314
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,399
substantial impact positive impact back

315
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,140
on the rest of the community

316
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,440
um so the the map on the right there is

317
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,000
actually where we have deployed the 11

318
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,959
micro mirrors so far at this point if

319
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,279
you're interested in hosting one of them

320
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,639
talk to me but more likely than not what

321
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,200
I really want you to do is think about

322
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,120
could you take some Hardware you have

323
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,079
already

324
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,420
and spin one up independent of us

325
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,959
because the more diversity there is in

326
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,160
this realm of these mirrors and the more

327
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,600
different approaches and different

328
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,540
organizations involved the less linchpin

329
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,000
we get as far as when one of the major

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,300
universities suddenly announces up we're

331
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,800
done we're out of the mirror department

332
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,540
and

333
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,700
all of a sudden it's like a quarter of

334
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,139
the mirrors in the North America start

335
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,720
having technical problems because their

336
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,480
Upstream sources disappeared so that's

337
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,060
that's pretty much what I've got here

338
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,480
um if you have any questions up here I'd

339
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,579
love to hear them right now

340
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,680
all right I guess not

341
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,720
um I I will be outside as well and so if

342
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,860
you have any offline questions or want

343
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,480
to talk to me privately

344
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,860
um by all means feel free

345
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,059
