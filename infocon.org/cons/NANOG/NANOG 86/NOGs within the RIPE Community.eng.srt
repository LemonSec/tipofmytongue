for upstaging me with his hair I thought

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,920
I was going to have the best hair of the

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,860
event but no he rocks up

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,680
um also the accent and the head I'm

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,480
really mad so I'm aware of that but here

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,379
we are

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,079
uh

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,879
so my name's Aleister Strachan I work

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,600
for the right uh NCC in Amsterdam

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,660
um as the Community Development officer

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,780
um I'm assuming everyone knows what the

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,480
Rope NCC is but we are the regional and

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,459
internet registry for Europe Middle East

28
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,580
and Central parts of Asia we also act as

29
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,200
the Secretariat for The Ripe community

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,320
so the Rope Community is in a forum of

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,420
um all parties interested in a wider

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,400
area of Ip Networks

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,159
we do a lot from maintaining the right

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,979
database allocating resources

35
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,740
um we also manage one of the 13 routes

36
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,860
so root servers

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,240
um I mean I'm not going to give you a

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,100
Spiel on all our services but just just

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,979
so you know we do quite a few things

40
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,140
um this is me as you can see

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,780
A lot happened in covid

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,280
um

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,799
I

44
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,600
um I've been at the company 10 years now

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,579
I actually started in their customer

46
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,040
service department

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,420
spent a while getting to know the

48
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,799
community and getting to know the ins

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,600
and outs of things and then moved into

50
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,060
an external relations role first a

51
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,920
junior they're normal and now the

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,140
Community Development officer So within

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,340
that kind of Community Development

54
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,939
officer role I have kind of Three Hats

55
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,860
um but I feel like now I'm just talking

56
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,598
about fashion and hair

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,979
um

58
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,900
um first up we have the ripe NCC

59
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,480
Community projects fund it's a fund of a

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,860
quarter of a million euro that gives

61
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,160
grants and um Awards things to uh

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
non-commercial projects that benefit the

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,099
the good of the internet so we've done

64
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:29,280
ictc schools we've funded open source um

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,020
hijacking software there's a whole host

66
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,000
I can provide you links if you're all

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,940
interested I also do a lot of the events

68
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,680
and Outreach so

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,379
um pre-covered we had a member member

70
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,319
lunch program where

71
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,420
we cover a lot of countries in fact I

72
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,099
think there's 76 within our service

73
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,340
region and it's very hard for us to

74
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,800
have interactions on a one-on-one basis

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,540
with some countries so we have these

76
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,099
member lunch programs where we'll go

77
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,780
we'll invite a load of people from that

78
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,000
local community and we'll chat with them

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,959
it's kind of like a a three-hour nog

80
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,180
um and then the reason I'm here today is

81
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,379
the nod coordination role um so we do

82
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,900
quite a lot of nogs we do quite a lot

83
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,720
for nogs we offer sponsorship so we

84
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,680
provide up to 1500 Euros per event we

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,940
also have a lot of knowledge and

86
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,800
speakers so we often provide content and

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,739
presenters to these events

88
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,620
um we do Open House events so open house

89
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,480
events are something that happened due

90
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,940
to the pandemic we were unable to do

91
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,580
member lunches so we opened up our house

92
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,739
to our lovely Community

93
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,900
um and we host open Ice events for nog

94
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,319
organizers so a chance for the 30 to 33

95
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,019
organizers of nogs within the region a

96
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,640
chance to get together discuss what's

97
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,319
been happening in their nogs and kind of

98
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,360
share information

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,659
um we have meetups that write meetings

100
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:56,760
and then also we have an internal focus

101
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,879
group of staff so the ripe NCC is lucky

102
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,260
we have

103
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,180
I don't know I think 50 plus languages

104
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,879
spoke within our within our staff

105
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,760
um and a lot of the local nod content is

106
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,280
in local language so we have a focus

107
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,900
group with staff of people who can

108
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,879
follow the discussions in French the

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,440
discussions in German it just makes it a

110
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,238
little bit easier for us to get the

111
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,918
information from them

112
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,180
so

113
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,780
earlier this year the

114
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,500
me the Rope NCC and the NOG organizers

115
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,020
collaborated on creating two surveys one

116
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,000
was going to the NOG participants one

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,919
was going to the organizers

118
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,380
now it was open for eight weeks and

119
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,600
whilst we did get 400 responses which

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,699
sounds like it's good number we were

121
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,680
stung by the and I don't want to make

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,840
Americans jealous here but the European

123
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,600
Vacation allowances

124
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,160
um and so although we did get good

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,440
number of responses it would have been

126
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,120
a lot better if we had more but that's

127
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,160
always the case with surveys

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
So nogs within our region we actually

129
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,320
have 32 knobs within our region so the

130
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,160
largest is PL log so Poland uh UK nof as

131
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,060
well

132
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,979
um the smallest events are something

133
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,660
that's kind of

134
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,180
started recently and their net

135
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,580
Manchester and net London now these

136
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,919
events are they happen once a month

137
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,080
they're a lot more lightweight they will

138
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,960
meet in a pub with a projector for

139
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,940
um football for soccer

140
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,139
um

141
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,120
and they will have one or two quick

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,160
presentations and then they will discuss

143
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,840
and chat and it's just a way for them to

144
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,180
meet up and I think I'd talk about these

145
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,100
later on in my presentation because I do

146
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,539
think it is

147
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,960
a potentially where nogs may end up

148
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,840
especially for smaller organization or a

149
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,419
smaller nog organizations

150
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,940
so the oldest nog within the ripe region

151
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,039
is swinog which is uh Switzerland so

152
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,560
that was founded in 2000 and the newest

153
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,199
nog which was founded last month is nog

154
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,840
HR which is um Croatia

155
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,380
I hope yes

156
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,840
um organizer organizational information

157
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,419
we see dogs

158
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,400
are organized many different ways in

159
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,199
regards to how they meet up some dogs

160
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,259
meet for one day events some one two

161
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,900
three times a year we have I mentioned

162
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,340
them earlier net Manchester and net

163
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,320
London they actually has housed 12

164
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,960
meetup events a year

165
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,600
um NL nog which is the Netherlands nog

166
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,880
they host three different events so they

167
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,919
have a social event at the beginning of

168
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,539
the year they have a knowledge event

169
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,340
afternoon one later on in the year

170
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,620
normally June and then they have what

171
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,780
you would all know as a nog meeting like

172
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,180
this

173
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,460
attendees I mean when I came here and

174
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,780
they were like yeah the attendees about

175
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,560
900 I was like what what

176
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,720
um our nogs have really ranged between

177
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,600
50 and 200 attendees we have a few

178
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,139
larger ones like uh de nog Germany frnog

179
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,440
that see over 200 attendees plnog's a

180
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,940
little different because it's a two-day

181
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,740
event so they see

182
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,160
a much larger number but that is spread

183
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,699
across the event so 800 attendees

184
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,220
this may be of interest or a surprise to

185
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,740
some of you because over 50 or nearly 50

186
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,860
of our nogs in our region are not legal

187
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,900
entities they are not registered

188
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,259
associations or or foundations they're

189
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,940
actually run by a handful of volunteers

190
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,620
and a lot of the times they're using

191
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,840
their own personal bank information they

192
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,599
use in their own money to put up for

193
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,199
these um events so whilst I understand

194
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,780
it because to set up an organization can

195
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,740
be

196
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,639
a challenge

197
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,319
the um big problem with these smaller

198
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,940
ones that are run individually is

199
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,800
getting sponsorship companies won't

200
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,020
sponsor a single like an individual like

201
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,580
here's my bank account give me 10 grand

202
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,500
I mean I wish they would otherwise I

203
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,599
wouldn't be on this stage

204
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,060
um but

205
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,340
um yeah I mean that's just an

206
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,680
interesting sack this one I think will

207
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,180
really blow your mind

208
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,460
I'm glad you're all sitting down

209
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,680
fifty percent of null communities are

210
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,539
made up of telecoms I.T services and

211
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,139
data centers

212
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,879
um in regards to communication methods

213
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,960
um

214
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,940
main communication methods again this

215
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,080
probably won't come as a surprise

216
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,500
mailing lists will remaining King we are

217
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,419
seeing an uptake in services like slack

218
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,640
and Discord especially with the younger

219
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,740
crowds

220
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,539
um

221
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,399
website updates and social media also

222
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,020
remain a key fee

223
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,820
a key feature when it comes to

224
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,220
communication channels and in areas such

225
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,560
as the Middle East and Persian Gulf it's

226
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,620
actually personal contact which is

227
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,200
um a lot more used in regards to sharing

228
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,760
information and things

229
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,440
now

230
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,800
one thing that kind of surprised me

231
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,580
um is how low IRC is on this list I mean

232
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,980
I'm quite happy to see it that low on

233
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,180
the list but I know there are some

234
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,279
people here who won't be

235
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,000
um

236
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
the shift is slack and WhatsApp and

237
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,180
other

238
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,019
um

239
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,420
uh Technologies I mean it is happening

240
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,000
and I think it is where a lot of this

241
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
communication channels are going to end

242
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,140
up will we ever shift away from mailing

243
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,360
lists I'll let you all decide that

244
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,380
um activity on non-communication

245
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,060
channels now

246
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,399
over 30 percent of participants are not

247
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,860
active on communication channels

248
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,279
again I mean we asked we asked an open

249
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,019
question on this as to why they

250
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,640
potentially wouldn't be

251
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,100
the majority of people mentioned time

252
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,560
restraints too much noise not always

253
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,120
relevant to what they're doing or

254
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,420
working on at that time

255
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,700
we also got

256
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,339
we also got some who said that mailing

257
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,500
lists can be of not

258
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,080
can be an aggressive Place sometimes if

259
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,120
you ever have posted something incorrect

260
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,860
on a mailing list everyone lets you know

261
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,779
you've posted something on incorrect on

262
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,279
a mailing list

263
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,800
um which can alienate people especially

264
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,380
new people into the communities so

265
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,540
what can be done with this I mean you

266
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,580
could moderate it but then for again for

267
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,140
smaller nogs to moderate your list as

268
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,700
well is additional work for these people

269
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,180
who are already volunteering their time

270
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,920
um let's have a look

271
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,320
uh a number of people mentioned the

272
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,120
mailing lists are dead Long Live slack

273
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,680
channels I had to copy that from

274
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,959
literally one of the responses Discord

275
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,080
is the way to go but that does actually

276
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,040
um

277
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,160
present challenges if you're in a

278
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
disorder and there's a million chats

279
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,060
going on at once it's hard to follow as

280
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,660
an individual discussion about a topic

281
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,719
um

282
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,579
Regional differences now I tried to

283
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,220
split this up but unfortunately the

284
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,620
number of respondents we had meant

285
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,899
although I can make it look like there's

286
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,240
a really interesting graph here we had a

287
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,100
lot of responses from certain areas and

288
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,680
a lot less from others so one thing we

289
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,079
did see I mean over 95 percent of Nordic

290
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,440
countries all are active on community

291
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,180
communication channels central eastern

292
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,339
Europe less so

293
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,899
with regards to nog participation we

294
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,180
wanted to find out what can nogs do to

295
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,459
encourage more participation we wanted

296
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,260
to know why do people attend nogs what

297
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,700
content do they want to see what

298
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,820
prevents them attending kind of remote

299
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,120
participation the dreaded word

300
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,839
um

301
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,000
most reasons to attend and I don't think

302
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,519
this will surprise anyone here social

303
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,920
networking presentation content and to

304
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,120
learn

305
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,120
um I mean yeah I don't think that's a

306
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
surprise I mean from people I've spoken

307
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,500
to here already one of the things that

308
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,380
was missed during covid was the social

309
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,660
interaction and the hallway charts and

310
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,880
bumping into someone so I think that's

311
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,760
something that will

312
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,500
sorry I think that's something that that

313
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,200
cannot be replaced um so I'm not

314
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,640
surprised to see that that social

315
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,700
networking is the top

316
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,680
here's another brief reasonable brief

317
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,420
again you can see it's pretty similar

318
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,160
across the board there was one slight

319
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,740
change with Iran and the Persian Gulf

320
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,779
um they have more preference towards

321
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,380
sharing experiences as opposed to just

322
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,360
watching uh watching someone go through

323
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,980
a slide deck so

324
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,079
um but again all of these were over 70

325
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,839
of the the votes as to what reasons

326
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,339
they're going

327
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,380
why do people why don't people attend

328
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,180
nogs

329
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,019
again this was a a an open

330
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,000
um question as opposed to us like

331
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,320
multi-choice one

332
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,260
reasons to prevent in person in person

333
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,740
attendance time travel course location

334
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,339
often held midweek now time I do

335
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,839
understand this because getting time off

336
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,000
work to an attend event especially if

337
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,760
it's not something direct with your job

338
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,959
can be a challenge for people location

339
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,399
especially I think especially this is

340
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,760
for more of a larger organized nogs

341
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,940
they're often held in larger cities and

342
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,560
it can be expensive and require

343
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,839
overnight accommodation to attend these

344
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,360
now again I'm speaking to a room of

345
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,800
Americans where you can drive eight

346
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,959
hours and still be in the same state I

347
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,639
can drive three hours and be in four

348
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,440
countries so

349
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,220
um

350
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,800
yeah I think my favorite answer as to

351
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,720
why someone wouldn't attend I'm too lazy

352
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,040
thanks for that feedback that's very

353
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,220
valuable

354
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,200
uh attending remotely so remote and in

355
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,019
person as you can see

356
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,300
in person is is still King uh remote

357
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,279
participation remains important for

358
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,620
people who are unable to attend

359
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,680
but there's ups and downs of it the cost

360
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,740
of high events is proving too much for

361
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,440
smaller nogs because if you are doing a

362
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,779
full live stream live chat you're

363
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,160
basically running two meetings at once

364
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,920
which doubles the cost

365
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,579
um as was when you factor in the most

366
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,680
important reason for people to attend

367
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,760
nogs is the social networking aspect

368
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,100
how does that translate remotely we as

369
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,779
the ripe NCC have tried to load of

370
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,240
different ways to do it during lockdowns

371
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,600
um so we did spatial chat which was this

372
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,760
chat function where you can like move

373
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,800
your icon around a room and the closer

374
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,079
you are to people the closer that you

375
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,880
only hear their microphones so it gives

376
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,440
that fake impression that you're in a

377
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,260
room but the novelty wears off of that

378
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,880
very quickly

379
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,060
um and also the costs for smaller nogs

380
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,199
is is too high

381
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,260
um yeah Regional differences again

382
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,959
um we've got 95 of people in the Nordic

383
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,720
will attend in person Iran and Western

384
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,380
Europe see more remote remote

385
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,779
participants I think that is just in

386
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,760
regards to the ease of travel in these

387
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,720
countries

388
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,820
and these regions

389
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,279
now I feel I've got another you need to

390
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,800
sit down for this one what content do

391
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
people want networking routing

392
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,060
automation open source software for the

393
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,779
top

394
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,519
there was no surprise there although

395
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,800
everyone was expecting that

396
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,600
um people are less interested in

397
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,100
non-tech non-ip and vendor presentations

398
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,560
again shocked

399
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,260
um surprised or maybe not surprised to

400
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,680
see sustainability on that low because I

401
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,139
do think that is something that we as a

402
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,420
community are going to have to start

403
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,459
taking seriously

404
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,380
um

405
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,959
in regards to the complexity of contempt

406
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,079
one this this kind of seems normal to me

407
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,779
people want intermediate level a few

408
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,639
people want high level but the challenge

409
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,100
with that is that comes with that is

410
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,800
does that then scare new people off so

411
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,139
if it's a first-time attendee who's just

412
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,880
started a job I don't know was an

413
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,399
engineering job if he comes to a nog

414
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,339
event and everything is super high end

415
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,740
is that going to be any use to him is he

416
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,660
ever going to come back

417
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,519
um

418
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,320
in regards to what can dogs do to

419
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,360
encourage more participation at events

420
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,639
again this is it

421
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,860
location of events costs better

422
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,600
communication of upcoming events

423
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,699
frequencies more opportunities to

424
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,940
network better remote participation so

425
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,820
this again was a free text free text

426
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,579
answer and there was the responses were

427
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:44,639
varied I mean the location again it's

428
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,839
this

429
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,839
for larger events they need an event

430
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,360
space that has the ability to host a

431
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,279
conference like this which limits them

432
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,380
to larger cities and more expensive

433
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,399
hotels

434
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,399
the cost of the events themselves is

435
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,480
also something that

436
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,439
I know it would be in an ideal world

437
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,079
that like people want oh no I just want

438
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,819
to come for free but these events aren't

439
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,679
free to put on so I understand that the

440
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,359
events fees can be too much for some

441
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,900
people but the knock has to be I think

442
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,500
it's not we're not it's not run for free

443
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,660
um the communication of events now this

444
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,280
is an interesting one that I don't think

445
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,459
would have you would experience in in

446
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,700
nanog because we have some nogs that are

447
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,620
organized two weeks before the event and

448
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,960
the invite goes out a week before

449
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,960
and whilst that is down too because it's

450
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,360
one dude doing his

451
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,340
um all the prep work and everything just

452
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,100
on his own in his in when he's not at

453
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,200
work it does make it very hard for

454
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,880
people to be able to go oh yeah let me

455
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,260
just put a travel request in for

456
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,539
tomorrow so

457
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,039
frequency

458
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,799
um this actually again Taps into these

459
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,780
meet up events that I mentioned earlier

460
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,220
the

461
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,080
um net London and the net Manchester

462
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,460
events

463
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,340
the more events there are the most the

464
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,740
more opportunities people have to come

465
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,660
um and especially with these these these

466
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,460
meetup events they are very lightweight

467
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,860
very low cost and even if you just get

468
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,080
20 people in there you've still got that

469
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,940
community and that connection and that

470
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,940
sharing knowledge and and things so

471
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,160
um more opportunities to network

472
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,260
um now this actually

473
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,780
is interesting because

474
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,020
there was someone who said I'm not sure

475
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,480
how I feel about this one let's have

476
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,700
half the amount of contact at content

477
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,179
and double the amount of coffee breaks

478
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,059
I get it but I mean we do have to have

479
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,760
some presentations right

480
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,720
um

481
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,940
better remote participation options

482
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,340
again if any of you know the secret to

483
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,380
remote participation please let me know

484
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,480
so I can patent it and retire

485
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,280
um I will touch on this I've tried I'm

486
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,960
trying to avoid bringing up covert at

487
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,480
every opportunity but no obviously there

488
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,880
was a little pandemic you may have heard

489
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,020
of

490
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,039
um

491
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,960
within the NOG Community certainly

492
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,880
within our within Europe where there

493
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,940
were a lot of very strict lockdowns

494
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,039
um every event was canceled every like

495
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,120
everything

496
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,580
there was a shift to Virtual events but

497
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,039
that was a very quick learning curve

498
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,559
like someone just on we're just zoom

499
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,200
calls where just people hang out

500
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,220
um in regards to as these virtual events

501
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,860
more and more were done people figured

502
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,600
out that taking longer breaks and having

503
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,299
less content went virtual actually does

504
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,000
make sense because I mean everyone knows

505
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,039
the curse of Zoom fatigue like you're

506
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,179
sitting on a computer and you're just

507
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,340
staring at it like what is he even

508
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,000
saying anymore

509
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,100
virtual events can't bring the value of

510
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,380
events that nogs do before the the

511
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,299
pandemic the mingling the hallway chat

512
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,799
it's impossible

513
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,360
um but we do need to have a remote

514
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,600
option four two eggs to to include

515
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,220
people who for whatever reason are

516
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,120
unable to attend

517
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,260
um it's certainly hard it was hard in

518
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,299
regards to the post-pandemic planning it

519
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,640
was very hard for the smaller nogs to

520
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,100
commit to planning an event so some nogs

521
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,960
are only now organizing their first

522
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,620
event purely because we had locked down

523
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,240
one and then things opened and then

524
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,520
locked down two and then things open and

525
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,440
especially if you're a one or two man

526
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,080
band putting on these events

527
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,419
you don't want to risk five grand of

528
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,880
your own money uh being lost because no

529
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,900
one can travel to the event

530
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,160
what is next for nogs again if anyone

531
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,660
has the answer to this please let me

532
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,500
know

533
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,480
um the ever-changing landscape I mean

534
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,799
it's hard to predict what the future

535
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,240
holds in Europe at the minute because

536
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,660
there is there's a lot going on

537
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,539
um same with young young people how do

538
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,220
we attract more young people they're

539
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,799
often entry-level employees who very

540
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,020
rarely get to travel in the first year

541
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,700
of their work

542
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,740
um is that something that we need to

543
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,160
look at as attendees and if you are

544
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,780
coming and you've got I don't know a

545
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,280
junior who's just started

546
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,200
see if you can bring them along I mean

547
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,120
the more people we can get in especially

548
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,340
younger I think that it will only help

549
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,840
communities

550
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,600
um the children are our future remember

551
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,980
[Laughter]

552
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,559
um

553
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:30,120
meet ups I feel like I've just turned

554
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,860
into a plug for net Manchester and net

555
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,320
London but I do think there is value I

556
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,880
really do think there are values in

557
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,440
meetups and I think this is something

558
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,120
that could translate to nanog and I'm

559
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,039
not sure if you do see or or state like

560
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,799
meetups at all but it's something to

561
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,539
look into because it's like I say it's a

562
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,520
lightweight opportunity to meet up

563
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,919
mingle see the people within your your

564
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,840
closer Community as opposed to the the

565
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,240
whole country and it does give a great

566
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,000
opportunity to to to to chat and network

567
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,620
and share ideas

568
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,140
and with that

569
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,400
I think I'll be quiet

570
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,700
any questions

571
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,700
stunned to silence my work here is done

572
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,120
oh

573
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,580
Tom Cruise from Mata but uh representing

574
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,220
China the question for you is how do you

575
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,340
uh how does ripe kind of help the mouse

576
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,919
kind of scale from let's say the 50 or

577
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,000
20 to 100 and 200 yeah yeah I mean the

578
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,100
the ripe NCC does does quite a lot I

579
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,100
mean we do a lot in regards to oh I

580
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,780
should say this we can only do so much

581
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,299
because we don't want to be seen as

582
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,460
we've come in and gone you've set up a

583
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,840
noggin it needs to be this because we

584
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,480
feel nogs should be organically grown by

585
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,700
the people in the community but we

586
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,380
certainly have tools and services that

587
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,419
people can provide in regards to meeting

588
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,340
softwares and things along those lines

589
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,340
so they can manage them a little easier

590
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,419
we also have a great up we share all of

591
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,980
these events and invites throughout

592
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,140
numerous mailing lists and and we have

593
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,000
events calendar on our site that

594
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
highlights when these events are coming

595
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,240
up to try and get more interest

596
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,360
sometimes we'll hold training

597
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,580
um we have a whole training department

598
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,820
rope bought at the Rope NCC will hold

599
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,740
training events parallel or the day

600
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,500
before so there's more people aware and

601
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,360
there's more more opportunity for people

602
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,700
to attend

603
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,659
years of course

604
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:38,460
uh a thought that has been brought to me

605
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,460
by a fellow attendee have you noticed

606
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,740
that the attendance here is about 10

607
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,320
years older in age than it is a right

608
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,580
region

609
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,700
I'm saying nothing

610
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,740
just to make everybody aware of the fact

611
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,200
yeah yeah uh thank you for your

612
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,799
presentation I'm taco from NTT and I'm

613
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,679
just curious about uh plnog uh there are

614
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,740
800 attendees in that and the biggest I

615
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,860
expect that the uh NL nog is the biggest

616
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,140
one but uh not uh what do you think

617
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,059
about it what makes the people attend

618
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,380
the piano

619
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,600
I I think there's a few things I mean

620
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,880
Poland is is quite a pretty pretty big

621
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,960
country

622
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,080
um I also think that the way their event

623
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,919
is I I they have a lot of

624
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,140
media around it they they have like TV

625
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,059
adverts about it and things so they have

626
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:36,059
a very big production with plnog and

627
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,299
also I where Poland is situated I think

628
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,039
it brings in a lot of the neighboring

629
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,320
countries to attend that whereas within

630
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,120
our

631
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,179
nlnog it's I mean NL noga is a big event

632
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,260
as well

633
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,700
um but I think with NL nuggets um

634
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,280
there's less it's I mean it's it's the

635
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,840
Netherlands in with someone like Poland

636
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,460
a lot of their neighboring countries

637
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,100
have the same issues as them so I think

638
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,480
that could be one of the contributing

639
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,220
reasons as to why it's such a

640
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,020
well-attended event

641
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,299
thank you thank you

642
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,159
I have five minutes to spare I speak

643
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,380
quick when I'm panicking

644
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,360
oh oh

645
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,360
one more yeah go for it

646
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,320
um

647
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,440
okay okay

648
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,299
Netflix uh do you have any numbers about

649
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,059
gender like

650
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,940
um we can see that this is like a lot of

651
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,539
uh males and very little females what is

652
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,039
the situation

653
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,240
um so with this survey to avoid gdpr

654
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,299
falling under gdpr things we didn't ask

655
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,179
any personal information and gender

656
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,580
falls into that it's something that we

657
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,620
can certainly look into to try and get

658
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,020
an idea of kind of the spread

659
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,059
um but it just with the way that this

660
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,980
survey was worded we didn't want to

661
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,720
include it because it then makes a whole

662
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,059
legal team need to be involved and all

663
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,679
of this stuff

664
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,960
but if I I will certainly try and find

665
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,799
out for you thank you

666
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,320
cool thanks everyone

667
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,340
[Applause]

668
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,080
