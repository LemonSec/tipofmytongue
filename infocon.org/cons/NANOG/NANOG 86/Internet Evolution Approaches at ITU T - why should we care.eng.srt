00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:08,820
to the screens Dr Hussein badran who

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,920
will be presenting internet Evolution

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,460
approaches at itu-t why should we care

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,320
Hussein holds the position of Regional

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,960
Technical advisor North America Bureau

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,000
with the internet society and he's based

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,439
in Ottawa Canada

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,539
this is Hussein's second time presenting

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,760
at nanog and it's a pleasure again to

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,260
have him speaking with us today welcome

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,920
Hussein

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,800
um the aim of the topic of this is this

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,379
talk here today is really to provide an

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,079
um an insight into discussions that are

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,739
happening at the itu T that look at

19
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,500
internet Evolution approaches and they

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,300
can have significant impact on how the

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,340
internet would evolve in the near to

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,739
distant future so awareness of these and

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,080
being participating being active in

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,880
these discussions is quite quite

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,960
critical

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,680
so The Talk The Talk today is um uh

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,380
composed of just looking at one of those

28
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,840
the key critical proposal at the itut

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,880
being discussed over the last several

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,080
months

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,119
um finding some insight into the new IP

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,520
proposal what are the key concerns the

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,159
internal society and other stakeholders

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,979
have seen into such proposals

35
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,740
um and then how this is being evolved to

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,920
to our date to today and then looking

37
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,100
into some um uh positive and effective

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,659
and successful evolution of the internet

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,820
particularly on vertical and specialized

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,100
Networks and reflecting on some very

41
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,840
recent developments are just two days

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,360
ago regarding the similar new IP to new

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,700
IP proposals so some of the acronyms

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,320
I'll be using in today's presentation

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,619
relates to the itot itut is a

46
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,140
specialized agency of the United Nations

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,520
it's a short for international

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,799
telecommunications Union

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,280
telecommunication centralization sector

50
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,899
that has several study groups that look

51
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:07,759
into

52
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,199
developing new standards study group 13

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,360
to Future networks 11 for signing and

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,340
requirements and then there is an

55
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,800
overarching

56
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,360
body this actual application

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,340
centralization Advisory Group looks into

58
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,739
the logistics and the operation and

59
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,440
approving these uh the questions being

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,260
studied at the study groups wtsa is

61
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,520
really the work to the work to

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,900
communication centralization assembly

63
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,780
were really the governments of the of

64
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,220
the world get together every four years

65
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,440
to agree on priorities of

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,180
standardizations for the next study

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,280
period

68
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,780
standards development organizations sdos

69
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,580
and Etsy is the European television

70
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,160
standards Institute

71
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,260
the new IP proposal

72
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,760
um is something that really that has

73
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,640
appeared in the in the itu as early as

74
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,300
2018 uh throughout a focus group that

75
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,980
was created

76
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,040
um to discuss the future of the internet

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,780
and how the internet would look like in

78
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,120
the year 2030.

79
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,340
uh This was done to a contribution to

80
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,459
tsag in 2019

81
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,739
um and then proposals started to emerge

82
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,220
into uh direct direction of the future

83
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,480
is this new IP proposal in 2020

84
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,340
um the terminology was changed to Future

85
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,900
vertical communication networks but

86
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,480
really the substance of the proposal has

87
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,360
has been kept kept intact

88
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,420
um the another key step is and after

89
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,180
significant opposition from from many

90
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,159
governments and and the same Society

91
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,040
members and other stakeholders and it

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,040
was cited at the itu site group 1311 not

93
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,959
to accept the new IP related questions

94
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,599
as new work items for for new standards

95
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,420
and as well as stop discussing new IP at

96
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,620
least until wtsa which took a place in

97
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,860
March 2022. so that was a decision taken

98
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,760
in um in December 2020 as but as we will

99
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,000
see really proposals very similar to new

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,099
IP with the elements of new IP kept on

101
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,799
coming to the iitut looking for standard

102
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,420
development in the same in the same

103
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,839
framework

104
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,120
um and these proposals actually have

105
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,720
appeared as from March 2021 under

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,900
polymer polymorphic networking as well

107
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,400
as immersive real-time communication

108
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,860
systems that we will look into a summary

109
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,720
of these proposals

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,500
um

111
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,320
um and that's also not only in study

112
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,300
group 13 and 11 also in study group 17

113
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,520
which means with security aspects of the

114
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,100
uh of of networks

115
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,780
um security guidelines for autonomistic

116
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,120
communication services for IMT 2020

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
networks and and Beyond so it is very

118
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
critical to keep really engaged and

119
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
aware and Vigilant to these proposals

120
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,820
and collaborating among the multiple

121
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,040
stakeholders that can be engaged in such

122
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,060
in such activities

123
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,820
um so the it the focus group on network

124
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,160
2030 came up with some technical reports

125
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,080
and the Gap analysis

126
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,040
um as as shown here in the year 2020

127
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,840
June 2020

128
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,120
but the key observations of this work is

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,740
that the Gap analysis were very high

130
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,699
level

131
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,199
um gaban answers here looks into what

132
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,720
the it2 iit2t should be doing versus

133
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,460
what other standards organizations are

134
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,000
currently doing like 3gbp or the ietf or

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,180
IEEE so the governance is performed by

136
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,620
the team here at the focus group was

137
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,139
very high level quite superficial and no

138
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,360
no format engagements through Liaisons

139
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,460
between the itu and

140
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,080
um and these other organizations took

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,300
place which means that there was no

142
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,660
formal discussion of the proposals

143
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,940
as a normal view quick overview of the

144
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,240
new IP proposal presented to itut uh

145
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,600
during 2019 and 2020. basically it has a

146
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,520
proposal from Hawaii to develop new

147
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,800
network protocols and architectures by

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,539
extending and redesigning the

149
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,940
traditional IP supporting new services

150
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,440
for a new internet by 2030. so the the

151
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,720
objective is not is not hidden it's not

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,060
being hidden it is the new network

153
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,160
architecture redesigned traditional IP

154
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,380
and the new internet and there are

155
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,360
elements of this that will cover a

156
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,539
couple two of them semantic addressing

157
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,860
as well as domestic services and

158
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,300
intrinsic security

159
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,699
as you see from the graph here new IP on

160
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,560
one side versus the traditional IP on

161
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,880
the other sides are complete replacement

162
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,319
was really the desire

163
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,180
much semantic addressing which is a key

164
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,280
component of the new IP proposal looks

165
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,199
into

166
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,699
extending the the address space Not only

167
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,039
include the version 4 or version 6

168
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,680
address but but new ID is to be added to

169
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,479
the to the address space including

170
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,280
individual ID so if you've got what is

171
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,620
called people IDs or service IDs for

172
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,180
quite a service Assurance between both

173
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,639
ends or Content ID to identify the

174
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,199
protocol and the content being being

175
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,240
sent between the sending and receiving

176
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,819
entity of course as do as well as the

177
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,699
device ID and then the IP IP address so

178
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,860
significantly more information is is

179
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,319
being provided is expected divided by

180
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,840
this proposal about the the participants

181
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,360
and the information be being sent so

182
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,740
really a foundation for Mass

183
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,240
surveillance

184
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,220
um that is being built into the new

185
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,979
architecture uh that's into the to

186
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,759
replace the current IP IP and the

187
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,520
current Internet

188
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,620
on the on the deterministic forwarding

189
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,340
side

190
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,220
here the aim is to provide delay

191
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,780
guarantees And Delay variation

192
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,060
guarantees and we're very stringent

193
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,419
guarantees in the order of multiple

194
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,020
microseconds or fractions or

195
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,780
milliseconds and multiple and and uh

196
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,300
multiple microseconds so very strange in

197
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,220
terms of guarantees are expected by this

198
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,020
this proposal

199
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,139
um and um some analysis done by itu

200
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,060
study group 12 which looks at quality of

201
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,340
service and performance issues of of

202
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,620
networks have identified that such

203
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,660
guarantees can only be delivered in a

204
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,440
local or city-wide Network and if a

205
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,840
distance on a regional or Global basis

206
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,819
such grantees can actually not not be

207
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,039
delivered so the the what that's being

208
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,960
asked here is not realistic to be

209
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,360
delivered by a global a global internet

210
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,340
architecture

211
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,919
so the key concerns in this in this

212
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,599
proposal are

213
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,639
um the lack of interoperability

214
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,520
introduced by by putting uh underground

215
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,799
a new architecture that is not really

216
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,419
interoperable with the existing

217
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,760
architecture new addressing scheme

218
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,020
um completely addressing scheme which

219
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,979
actually will lead to internet

220
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,440
fragmentation so this is an outcome that

221
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,540
will be expected for introducing such a

222
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,120
global architecture and success success

223
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,580
of the internet has has been based of

224
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,980
innovation and standards that are really

225
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,380
incremental you'll base one Innovation

226
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,180
on top of the other one success on top

227
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,800
of the other it's an evolutionary

228
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,040
process not a revolutionary process

229
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,680
um uh along with this line capital

230
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,839
investment in the hardware and the

231
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,459
software in the network infrastructure

232
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,279
why they buy it by The Operators by

233
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,019
national research education networks for

234
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,519
Enterprise Networks

235
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,120
will will be actually at that threat

236
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,480
um if such a migration

237
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,640
takes place to a new protocol and a new

238
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,500
architecture Without You consideration

239
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,740
for the investment protection okay and

240
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,540
the the the proposal tries to sell

241
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,760
future Technologies engage current

242
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,860
Network architecture and services which

243
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,600
is really not really comparing apple

244
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,519
apple to Apple

245
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,600
um

246
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,580
a laptop automated networks is not

247
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,140
really lack of capability because the

248
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,600
deployment of services is driven also by

249
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,640
market demand and consumer demand not

250
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,140
only by technology and standard

251
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,240
advancements

252
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,980
so something really some false claims

253
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,839
have been have been made in this this

254
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,640
proposal and they'll articulate also in

255
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,620
the in the next slide

256
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,399
um

257
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,080
um the the current networking

258
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,339
environment is not only the internet

259
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,500
that is based on multiple heterogeneous

260
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,680
networks interconnected together

261
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,240
so this network cannot handle to

262
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,580
heterogeneous networks such as

263
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,940
okay well-known um false false claim

264
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,800
ultra high throughput can be supported

265
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
today for sure given the high definition

266
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,760
Services being deployed on the network

267
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,040
today within a huge amount of video

268
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,380
conferencing services at high quality as

269
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,360
we are doing doing now

270
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,420
the fact that low latency is required is

271
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,380
not really

272
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,140
um on a global global basis it can be an

273
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,360
original or local basis but very low

274
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,279
latency be required on a global basis is

275
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,320
sort of something that is not not really

276
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,120
realistic

277
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,519
these concerns were put forward by by

278
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,019
the European telecommunication Network

279
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,339
operators Group which is the alliance or

280
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,220
group um we bring together the European

281
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,440
Telecom operators and they have raised

282
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,060
their concerns directly to the the chair

283
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,640
of study group 13 when the decision was

284
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,339
being made in cyber 2020 to stop or

285
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,700
Advance this new new proposal and they

286
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,100
articulated three three major concerns

287
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,200
that high investment the water Telecom

288
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,640
networks and infrastructure

289
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,680
infrastructures should not be threatened

290
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,459
by deployment of new Internet Protocol

291
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,800
as well as it is very critical to avoid

292
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,860
duplication of efforts that should be no

293
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,600
overlap between what the itu is doing

294
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,459
versus what other sdos and standard

295
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,560
organizations are doing

296
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,899
giving giving example the ietf and the

297
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,360
attribute and also the the internet

298
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,279
protocols and their success has been

299
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,760
that they were developed in a

300
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,779
multi-stakeholder environment that is

301
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,040
open

302
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,899
um available for stakeholders and bottom

303
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,279
app fashion not such as the the ietf and

304
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,560
the i2b are not driven by top-down

305
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,500
processes as in the in the itu which is

306
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,800
the government-led decision-making body

307
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,260
here I present two examples that

308
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,260
happened in March 2021 in proposals

309
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,060
after the decision to stop discussing

310
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,160
uip and as you will see the elements of

311
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,260
new IP are presented in these proposals

312
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,240
so one the first one is polymorphic

313
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,060
networking what's called pilot

314
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,320
and here

315
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,120
what is proposed is a new type of

316
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
network architecture and potential

317
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,079
Network model for the future six

318
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,959
donation mobile communication network

319
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,820
using some some

320
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,140
buzzwords and keywords to do to to

321
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,260
attract attention but the key points is

322
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,500
that this proposal looks into addressing

323
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,420
um routing schemes switching modes

324
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,220
interconnection modes Network element

325
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,160
forms transmission protocols that enable

326
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,200
the network to support specialized and

327
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,540
customized Services which means a new

328
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,000
Global architecture and it became very

329
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,920
clear once we looked into what kind of

330
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,139
addressing scheme this network is

331
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,700
supposed to use

332
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,800
by the way this proposal is based on on

333
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,399
one paper published in an uh in a

334
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,620
journal that really is very high level

335
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,380
and does not provide any justification

336
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,120
for such an approach

337
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,980
the addressing scheme I was referring to

338
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,320
is here is shown here it's showing that

339
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,779
it's really a multi-semantic addressing

340
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,880
scheme very similar to the original uh

341
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,880
new IP proposal again requiring

342
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,279
in addition to the iip addresses in the

343
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,060
header identity ID Content ID location

344
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,940
ID multiple information being gathered

345
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,040
from by by descending and receiving

346
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,779
parties which is really the foundation

347
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,420
of our widespread service

348
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,399
um institutional uh surveillance

349
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,880
mechanism

350
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,100
concerns here are that that proposal is

351
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,079
a research topic really it's not and

352
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,820
it's far too early to seek International

353
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,320
standardization

354
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,420
The Proposal does not include sufficient

355
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,040
information

356
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,320
um for the need of a new architecture or

357
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,260
its potential use our Gap analysis would

358
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,160
work related being done at other sgos

359
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,500
and such discussions of such proposals

360
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,120
that we look look into the architecture

361
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,399
of the global internet to take place not

362
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,980
at the igu but at others and other

363
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,839
centers organizations particularly the

364
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,959
ieta

365
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,120
the second proposal looks into the other

366
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,980
side look side of the internalistic

367
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,139
services or in other words immersive

368
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,899
real-time Communications and here the

369
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,639
proposal looks into

370
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,320
how can can real-time services such as

371
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,040
um

372
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,100
um heterogeneous homographic type

373
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,019
Communications

374
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,519
um or two additional twins to be

375
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,300
incorporated into a future architecture

376
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,100
providing guarantees including ultra

377
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,040
high bandwidth ultra low latency

378
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,380
strict simple synchronization that is

379
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,820
similar to what we have seen from the

380
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,420
original Ip new IP proposal and the case

381
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,240
studies in this in this scenarios

382
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,100
um uh the two one two Key signs

383
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,380
presented are the digital twins as well

384
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,199
as the holographic type communication

385
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,360
services and this service by the way

386
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,639
they are currently being being delivered

387
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,019
on existing existing internet

388
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,600
architecture and architecture today is

389
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,740
scaling up to support such such services

390
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,720
nevertheless this is what the proposal

391
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,660
coming again from from from China to uh

392
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,760
for a new Global architecture that

393
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,060
supports these use cases

394
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,680
um that we have seen for the new IP

395
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,560
proposal a new IP proposal

396
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,420
um

397
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,040
as a new standardization item for the

398
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,860
itut study group 13. here again the key

399
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,779
concerns were this is a research topic

400
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,399
it's not really ready for international

401
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,040
centralization as well as insufficient

402
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,079
information why actually this work is

403
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,180
needed why a new architecture is needed

404
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,920
given that it can be supported today on

405
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,380
existing internet

406
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,940
and whether the itu is a place to

407
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,980
discuss these person's other standards

408
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,480
organizations like the ietf

409
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,240
the building moving from these efforts

410
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,639
to continue at efforts and persistent

411
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,680
efforts to bring in new kinds of

412
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
evolutionary scenarios for the internet

413
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,260
at the itu-t not all Evolution passes

414
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,480
are really harmful to the internet the

415
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,860
other Evolution Pathways which have

416
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,899
proven over time to be very successful

417
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,660
in expanding in the internet and

418
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,800
providing

419
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,360
um The permissionless Innovation that

420
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,459
the internet is based to and one of this

421
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,380
direction is the vertical or specialized

422
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,380
networks but Innovation takes place more

423
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,139
on the edge of the network

424
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:29,940
and definition of a vertical or

425
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,639
specialized networks is um that they

426
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,079
typically use protocols that are

427
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,480
optimized for the deployment scenario

428
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,779
being manufacturing architecture

429
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,519
agriculture Smart City

430
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,399
smart health and the like and the

431
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,860
optimization optimization here targets

432
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,660
less overhead I.E High higher data rate

433
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,060
um or or throughput and at the same time

434
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,620
higher speed

435
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,839
and this optimization typically take

436
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,060
place at the physical physical layer of

437
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,459
the network or at the data link layer of

438
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:03,779
the network or the Mac layer of the

439
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,160
network

440
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,500
and in order to achieve the efficiencies

441
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,819
that they that that is is aimed for they

442
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,859
these protocols avoid the complex

443
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,500
routing decisions and because these

444
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,579
sound institutions will require

445
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,919
significant processing and relatively

446
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,900
long headers in order

447
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,520
um and this would really increase the

448
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,319
complexity of the protocols and then

449
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,900
reduce Network throughput

450
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,419
so these networks would run being

451
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:31,860
controlled either the physical layer or

452
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,780
the max layer and then one single point

453
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,220
in the network

454
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,260
will be the interface to the to the

455
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,720
internet and hence the incorporation of

456
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,220
the IP header would be would be

457
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,960
necessary but the rest of the network

458
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,020
will operate at a much lighter lighter

459
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,720
overhead and header header structure

460
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,480
an example of this is what this Etsy is

461
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,820
currently working on for smart

462
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,820
manufacturing domain

463
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,660
um

464
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,780
there's a non-ip networking group

465
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,480
um or isg industry specification group

466
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,760
that really looks into building some

467
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,280
sort of protocol for and smart

468
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,280
manufacturing manufacturing site and

469
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,900
they um they came up with a protocol

470
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,299
protocol structure for this particular

471
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,059
particular requirement where we have

472
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,880
um a large number of robots that need to

473
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,660
be controlled in a very small time frame

474
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,559
and between every uh 100 millisecond

475
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,000
1000 or more robots being being

476
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,940
controlled so a real-time interface is

477
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,840
is required

478
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,160
and here a protocol was was put a

479
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,260
protocol proposals put together at sea

480
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,020
for this client of specific scenario uh

481
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,059
smart manufacturing site called flexi

482
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,240
link Network model and here they propose

483
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,700
a a simplified header header structure

484
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,820
as well as a flow or virtual circuit

485
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,400
circuit

486
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,660
mode of transmission so the connection

487
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,340
that's environment becomes a connection

488
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,620
oriented environment between between the

489
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,620
switch and and the the controller as

490
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,080
well as as the moving moving entities

491
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,620
the robots at the on the floor of the

492
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,780
manufacturing manufacturing site with a

493
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,700
simplified packet text header structure

494
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,220
as as I mentioned so this protocol is

495
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,679
optimized for this particular use and

496
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,900
only in this confined confined domain

497
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,120
and single domain environment so no

498
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,660
signaling protocol was was specified so

499
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,880
it cannot be really replicated or

500
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,640
expanded to a global global original or

501
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,500
architecture which is contained with

502
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,559
this specialized Network or local local

503
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,160
control Network very

504
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,360
welcomed Innovation at the agile Network

505
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,460
for specialized application another

506
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,440
specialized application is within the

507
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,360
smart

508
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,660
Smart City or smart connectivity domain

509
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,640
Laura land I'm sure you um it's quite

510
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,620
it's quite well known we're really an

511
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,539
innovation in the wireless wireless

512
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,240
domain using space Spectrum technology

513
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,400
allowed connectivity of multiple smart

514
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,260
devices that have a low power the low

515
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,299
throughput requirements the qualdera

516
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,220
sensors we connected to base stations

517
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,840
and then from there the Gateway is

518
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,299
connected potentially to the to the to

519
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,460
the internet for routing for routing

520
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,360
decisions

521
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,120
to reach the final Final Destination so

522
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
another Innovation on on the the

523
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
smartphone activity smart city city

524
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,140
domain that is um again expands the

525
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,840
evolution expands the edge of of the of

526
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,820
the network with multiple large number

527
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,580
of smart device connected to to the the

528
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,960
controllers

529
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,900
the third and final example is the cdns

530
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,120
and the content distribution networks is

531
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,160
really an evolution of the internet Edge

532
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,720
to allow

533
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,440
um

534
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,840
um the caching of content to be as close

535
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,000
as possible to the end user instead of

536
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,820
being stored in central location have to

537
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,980
Traverse the network to which the the

538
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,620
end user at the edge so this is an

539
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,100
evolution of the of the of the IP based

540
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,320
Network that allows for higher higher

541
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,140
higher throughput better experience

542
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,880
um to be delivered to the to the end

543
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,280
user

544
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,179
um

545
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,820
um and it's a revolution pass for for

546
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,160
the for for the for the internet uh for

547
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,140
video services this is an example on on

548
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,840
the right it shows hierarchical

549
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,200
um cdns to allow multiple caching levels

550
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,260
to deliver high quality video Services

551
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,940
um applications to the to the to the

552
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,240
endings

553
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,039
um uh finally just wanted to mention

554
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,840
some recent recent very recent

555
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,360
development that took place uh in in

556
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,520
this in this domain so new IP is not

557
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,500
something that happened in 2020 and we

558
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,720
forget about it it is a continued

559
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,760
continued effort and consistent effort

560
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,460
by the proponents of new IP to try to

561
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,679
introduce new architectures for the

562
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,020
global internet through

563
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,000
um the itot in this case potentially to

564
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,340
other areas but through itut is why we

565
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,480
see the threat coming from at this point

566
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,360
and this newer newer developments took

567
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,080
place

568
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,919
um

569
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,120
for example at the wtsa in March 2022

570
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,460
here originally um there was a proposed

571
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,860
resolution on cyber security included

572
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,780
reference to Intrinsic security as we

573
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,940
have seen this is one critical component

574
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,860
of the new IP proposal

575
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,260
so we're very critical that this term is

576
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,179
not accepted in the final final version

577
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,340
it was replaced by for example something

578
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,260
called security by Design which is a

579
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,440
more understandable more confined

580
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,400
confined term

581
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,919
another resolution on centralization of

582
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,360
non-radio aspects of international

583
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,280
mobile telecommunication to

584
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,100
Communications had multiple references

585
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,679
for the focus group work on future

586
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,780
networks which means that future work

587
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,520
should be based on the outcomes of this

588
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,080
future Group which is really direction

589
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,080
of new IP so it was very critical that

590
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,480
this proposal is not accepted and the

591
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,299
final version of the resolution has all

592
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,679
this kind of these kinds of references

593
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,120
omitted which we are able to

594
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,919
successfully achieve at wtsa at wtdc

595
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:11,940
which is the word application

596
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,059
development conference

597
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,600
had had a proposal from from China

598
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,539
coming into a resolution that deals with

599
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,059
deployment of IPv6 particularly in

600
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,520
developing countries and introduces

601
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,280
slightly introduced a term called ibv6

602
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,220
plus that was very vaguely very vaguely

603
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,740
defined

604
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,360
and wanted to build to have efforts done

605
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,700
by the it2 for capacity building of

606
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,320
deployment of IPv6 and V6 plus and if

607
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,419
you see that what what the examples of

608
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,419
what kind of Protocols are under ibb6

609
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,520
Plus or under what kind of Technologies

610
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,700
are under this IPv6 plus included the

611
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,559
gymnastic Services included multiple

612
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,840
addressing schemes included

613
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,020
I use use of AI very open-ended very

614
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,000
Loosely defined that allows you to

615
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,520
introduce anything including a new

616
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,100
architecture into such such a resolution

617
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,820
and this was um really a big storm at

618
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,740
the the wtdc and it was uh

619
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,880
not accepted to be included in

620
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,000
resolution 1-130 and all references was

621
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,580
only confined to IPv6 deployment and

622
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,120
capacity building on IPv6

623
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,679
the last one I wanted to mention is

624
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:29,880
something that's happened actually just

625
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,580
48 hours ago on on Monday

626
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,280
and here another study group at the itu

627
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,980
and I said look that these environmental

628
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,340
aspects of of Delegation Networks

629
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,640
and Dr proposal coming again from China

630
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,919
to creation of a new question which

631
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,360
means a new standards a standard um

632
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,919
password new standard to be developed

633
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,659
that looked into environmentally

634
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,299
sustainable development and operation of

635
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,600
ICT Network so it is the title is quite

636
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,919
it's quite Beyond and not really benign

637
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,260
and not really will catch any attention

638
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,120
but if you look into the details of the

639
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,320
proposal

640
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
the details of the proposal has this

641
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,460
particular this particular paragraph

642
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,340
which is very very alarming study how

643
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,440
the reduction of network layers and

644
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,020
flatten the overall Network architecture

645
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,480
would achieve so and so new network

646
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,700
architecture solutions to replace the

647
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,400
traditional three-layer Network topology

648
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,799
review and reducing the number of node

649
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,059
devices

650
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,220
so basically it's a completely new

651
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,679
architecture of the global global IP

652
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,380
based Network it is flattened reduction

653
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,260
of network layers that production of

654
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,000
network nodes coming up with new

655
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
protocols so basically we are back to to

656
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,460
the framework that looks into some sort

657
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,279
of a new IP to replace exist existing

658
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,559
Global Internet architecture and this

659
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:58,740
happened only 48 hours ago and until now

660
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,559
it is being being debated I present

661
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,360
intervention on behalf of the Indian

662
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,860
Society at the planning meeting with

663
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,580
study group 5 on on Monday and we are in

664
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,200
discussion hopefully this will not go

665
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,659
the aim is not go through as an accepted

666
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,320
question but this shows that there is

667
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,380
persistence in in providing

668
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,179
um a venue to discuss and and

669
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,100
standardize a new Global architecture

670
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,080
for the internet not only for from

671
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,820
future network side but here from the

672
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,039
environmental side and environmental

673
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,039
sustainability and climate change is

674
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,539
something that we all kick care about

675
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,900
and we all want to achieve

676
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,700
positive positive steps in this

677
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,980
direction but here this this particular

678
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,779
paragraph shows you that the aim really

679
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,480
or the tool touch is here to actually to

680
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,059
work completely redesign the global

681
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,159
architecture of the of the internet

682
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,779
which is a very certainly very

683
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,880
threatening uh very threatening

684
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,620
threatening approach

685
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,779
so it is important here that the key

686
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,120
Point here is important that we are

687
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,400
aware of these developments happening at

688
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,279
the itu team and iqt is open not only to

689
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,159
government delegates but also to sector

690
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,460
members and sector members are can be a

691
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,820
private entities Telecom operators

692
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,400
vendors it can be Academia research

693
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,380
research entities

694
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,480
and the sector numbers are allowed to

695
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,220
contribute submit contributions to

696
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,840
discuss this

697
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,120
um and make make presentations of these

698
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,220
contributions the only thing they're not

699
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,440
allowed to do is to have a vote like the

700
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,640
government to government delegations

701
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,700
have a vote to order to move or to stop

702
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,480
um a proposal from becoming a standard

703
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,279
so in summary

704
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,340
um proposals like new IP they pose a

705
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,260
very significant threat to the global

706
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,659
internet model and architecture

707
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,940
and although discussions of new IP were

708
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,340
stopped I study group 11 and 13. in

709
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,980
December 2020 as I mentioned but there's

710
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,080
a persistent persistent desire

711
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,080
persistent effort by by the proponents

712
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,820
of of this uh new architecture to submit

713
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,400
um other proposals that include elements

714
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,400
of of the of the new IP purpose

715
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,360
two various study groups at itut not

716
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,400
only selling Group 13 and 11 which deals

717
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,140
with future networks over signaling that

718
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,299
were original original custodian of the

719
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,779
uh new IP proposal but to the security

720
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:27,900
group study group two now and most

721
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,179
recently to the environmental study

722
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,580
group and as you see this is just

723
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,799
ongoing and continuing

724
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,960
um coming with very strong persistence

725
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,620
to the to the I.T and various vigilance

726
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,000
participation

727
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,039
um being aware of these discussions and

728
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,480
raising these points at different

729
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,419
different four including Forum of nanog

730
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:49,559
where

731
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,080
um large community of network engineers

732
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,059
and experts participate

733
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,799
um is important so that the

734
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,440
participation and engagement can be can

735
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,460
be increased at the same time Innovation

736
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,900
is key to the evolution of the internet

737
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,240
and we see Innovation particularly in

738
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,700
vertical networks that expand and evolve

739
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,919
the edge of the of the of the internet

740
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,620
is very useful to the evolution of the

741
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,779
internet and very much welcome and they

742
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,419
are basically driven by by demand and

743
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,600
need not by just an international

744
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,960
standard that will imply and dictate a

745
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,299
specific architecture to be to be uh

746
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,200
deployed okay

747
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,659
thank you thank you so much this is

748
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,240
um I hope that this was was clear and

749
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,700
the messages will came through and I'm

750
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,919
happy to take take questions thank you

751
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,159
so much

752
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,320
foreign

753
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,020
do we have any questions we're saying

754
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,080
hello thank you for your talk uh Andrew

755
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,740
tall my question is about whether the

756
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,940
new IP and Alternate identifiers ideas

757
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,340
have been reduced to anything more than

758
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,100
PowerPoint slides as in of any

759
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,740
specifications actually been drafted and

760
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,539
are is there any code that people have

761
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:22,039
started writing around these ideas

762
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,320
actually this is an excellent excellent

763
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,320
question the proponents of of the new

764
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,460
IPA framework have repeatedly claimed in

765
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,440
conferences and in a different form

766
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,559
including side meetings as the ATF that

767
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,539
they have prototypes working prototypes

768
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,480
of this code and and this this switching

769
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,539
architecture and so there is a claim

770
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,299
that that the components for example

771
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,059
Huawei have built prototypes

772
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,179
um and uh um are ready for demonstration

773
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:56,580
of these of these Technologies they have

774
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,700
not been publicly seen as far as far as

775
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,620
I know but the claim is is there and

776
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,080
it's been documented in in some research

777
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,640
papers and publications

778
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,299
we need to keep in mind that China is a

779
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,700
huge Market on its own so deployment can

780
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,980
can take place there without the rest of

781
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,340
the world be being aware of this uh of

782
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,840
this taking taking place

783
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,000
and there are support there is support

784
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,240
for for this Direction coming from from

785
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,760
uh certain certain countries

786
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,220
um that could also be a ground for

787
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,960
initial deployment

788
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,659
so here again awareness vigilance and

789
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,880
participation in the discussion is quite

790
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,260
critical to understand really the

791
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,240
reality of what what is being proposed

792
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,760
but I believe from from my experience

793
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,820
that it goes beyond just Sparkle's lines

794
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,320
yes there has no been standard

795
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,539
specifications but will stop the effort

796
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,159
is still continuing and persistent to

797
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,919
develop standard specifications but the

798
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,840
the demo part

799
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,899
um is has been ongoing scenes uh for for

800
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,340
quite some time

801
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,840
thank you very much

802
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,439
thank you

803
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,039
any additional questions

804
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,240
well thank you again for the present

805
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,220
today and thanks for your time today I'm

806
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,020
saying thank you thank you it's a

807
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,918
pleasure thank you so much
