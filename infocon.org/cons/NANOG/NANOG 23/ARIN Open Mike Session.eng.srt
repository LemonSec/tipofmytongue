148
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,150
we have the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy mailing list</font>

149
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,110
where most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our policy discussions</font>

150
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:39,289
take place and then there's an ipv6

directly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> announce that they want a</font>

162
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:13,459
policy discussion to begin on one issue

163
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:15,199
or another they can post freely to one

of the open policy mailing lists

165
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,319
themselves and initiate a policy

166
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,999
discussion there and we also receive

feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> from people in forms like these</font>

in particular policy proposals is on the

173
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,159
board because during a previous open mic

174

session and in there and meeting someone

175
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,430
brought it up and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now a policy</font>

meeting now the seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them listed</font>

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,819
here the first one just briefly go

through each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these everyone in</font>

180
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,080
here I'm sure knows that that there's a

181
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:58,669
responsibility on the user and operator

182
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,709
community to report their reassignment

183
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:02,180
information to their in whois database

184
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:03,740
or to place their reassignment

185
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:09,289
information in their own our whois

186
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:12,769

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,779
reassignments inside the / 29 or larger

188
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:18,830
it's been proposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we move this</font>

189
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:20,449
back to a 28 / 28 so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations do</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">not have to port report reassignment</font>

192
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:29,269
longer prefixes the second policy

193
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,899
proposal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing as</font>

194
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:35,688
justification for / 24 reassignments now

195
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:38,899
the this policy discussion began on our

196
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:40,789
mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists a few months ago and was</font>

197
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,779
finally posted again 30 days prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

198
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,800
our meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

199
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:47,510
next week but what's in this policy

200
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,760
proposal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you have a</font>

201
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,470
downstream customer an insight that

202
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,520
you're reassigning address

203
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,530
generally the guideline that you need to

204
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,510
follow is that that that inside

205
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">testament needs to demonstrate an</font>

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,710
immediate<font color="#CCCCCC"> need for twenty-five percent</font>

207
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,970
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're assigning to them and</font>

208
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,830
demonstrate that they have plans within

209
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,810
one year to utilize fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

210
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:10,890
what you're assigning them its proposed

211
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:12,510
that we no longer use that as the

212
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,850
reassignment justification for

213
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,030
downstream insight customers and that if

214
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multihomed by default and isp</font>

215
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:24,060
would be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reassign a / 24 to them</font>

216
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:27,180
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that policy proposal the third</font>

allocation policies we<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently have</font>

233
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,140
policies in place that organizations

234
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,270
would need to adhere to in order to

235
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,480
qualify<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an initial allocation of v6</font>

236
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,770
directly from the registry this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide</font>

237
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,540
open for discussion right now and

238
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,670
they're they're actually polish policy

239
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:32,280
proposals out there to a modify those

240
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:34,170
policies we number<font color="#E5E5E5"> five is a micro</font>

assignment policy for multi<font color="#CCCCCC"> homesites</font>

242
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,760
now this was brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

243
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,920
proposed it to our list the 30 days

244
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,830
prior<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the meeting but this is what</font>

245
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,410
you suspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is the registry making</font>

246
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:49,380
direct it's a proposal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry</font>

247
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,290
to make direct assignments to<font color="#CCCCCC"> end user</font>

248
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,030
sites will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing of us last 24</font>

249
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,680
and that's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> assignment it's</font>

250
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,620
longer than<font color="#E5E5E5"> our standard allocation size</font>

251
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,420
of a / 20 so we have a discussion going

252
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,160
on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list about this as</font>

253
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,949
well and it will be discussed at a

254
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,569
public policy muted next

255
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,580
number six single organizations with

256
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,170
multiple aggregation points<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

257
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,670
what that is is you know an organization

258
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,490
receives address<font color="#CCCCCC"> space directly from</font>

259
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin would need to demonstrate when they</font>

260
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,030
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back for additional address space</font>

261
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,760
at eighty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their previous</font>

262
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,020
allocation has been efficiently utilized

263
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,210
now some organizations are having

264
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:28,110
difficulty with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because they may</font>

265
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:33,650
have multiple data centers throughout

266
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:35,850
their service regions that have distinct

267
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,040
routing at each one of them and

268
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,050
therefore because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some filtering</font>

269
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">policies they would need to place a</font>

270
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">slash twenty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> renounce a slash pointing</font>

271
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,260
out of each of those separate data

272
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:48,600
centers<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of routing issues now if</font>

273
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,090
they were to receive say a / 18 from

274
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,120
Erin and they had four data centers and

275
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,320
may give a / 22 each one of those they

276
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,130
feel that they're being penalized

277
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,010
because if one of those data centers

278
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,720
grows much quicker than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other three</font>

279
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,760
they need address space for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

280
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,960
location that can't take address space

281
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,600
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other ones and give it to it</font>

282
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,160
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this last 20 filtering but</font>

283
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,080
they do need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come to the registry to</font>

284
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,240
request additional address space they

285
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,300
can't show us eighty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent utilization</font>

286
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,100
on that on that / 18 and receive the

287
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,469
last time so what we're talking about

288
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,830
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is creating new policy at Erin that</font>

289
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,600
allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this this the</font>

290
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,460
aggregation into consideration when

291
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,070
we're evaluating requests for additional
