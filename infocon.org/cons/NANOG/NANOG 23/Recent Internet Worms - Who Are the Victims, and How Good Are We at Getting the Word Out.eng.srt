1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,029
sounds good to me so briefly going to

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,710
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some work that's being done</font>

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,670
at kata and with some other folks tell

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,650
you where we got some of our data

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,089
because actually it affects or

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,859
methodology and I think our current

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,580
methodology is not going to scale very

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,140
well very soon I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,630
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global community's</font>

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,970
response led to what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might consider a</font>

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,198
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario we had a week of</font>

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,169
warning that there was going to be to

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,290
speak virus automatic worms spread there

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,460
was all this news coverage what happened

15
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,079
don't talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what we're actually</font>

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,879
seeing in post and some of the problems

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,590
with analyses people have been doing

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">they saw and looking at number of IP</font>

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,539

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,039
little bit about the victims so we got

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,960
our data we have a splash age that we're

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,699
monitoring we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple / six teams</font>

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,010
we're looking at originally as well and

25
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,449
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look for send packets and that says</font>

26
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,430
well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for people trying to send</font>

27
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,070
port 80 cents machines that don't exist

28
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,589
and we assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,150
spread of worm now obviously it's hard

30
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,250
to tell which variants they are because

31
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't get a payload with a lot of</font>

32
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on so right now there's no</font>

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cenac going back to encourage payload</font>

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:22,799
the future so everyone's seen this this

36
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:26,009
was very smoothly but of his original

16 hours or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this led to a</font>

being played on news coverage in other

53
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,990

other news affiliates of covering

69
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,870
similar stories so maybe that's why what

70
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,940
you'll see you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been happened we do</font>

71
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,430
the follow-up survey immediately well

72
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,700
not immediately about four days after

73
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,900
initial Code Red we started probing the

74
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,869
350,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we saw were infected</font>

75
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,129
to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've been touched and we</font>

76
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:08,109
pick ten thousands and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

77
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:08,108
randomly grab those and went on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

78
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:18,260
so this invisible red line that I'm

79
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:21,290
tracing over is the unpatched percentage

80
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,720
over time and this invisible green line

81
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,388
that I'm tracing over is the pass

82
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,150
percentage over time and this is only

83

in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle east to line starts across</font>

96
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,310
when we see the switch in the trend from

97
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,739
most machines being still unpatched to

98
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,230
most of genes being patched what you'll

99
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,140
see is that point actually happened in

100
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,609
the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> August first after it's</font>

101
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,859
already woken up and infected everyone

102
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,769
again people didn't start patching this

103
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,060
machine until it already came out we

104
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,500
gave them a week's worth of notice

105
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,700
there's all this news coverage the

106
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,320
government said please up attach

107

109
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,710
everyone waited until it got them again

110
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,270
before they patch so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a show that</font>

111
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,710
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the right way of getting</font>

us when we suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do something</font>

whether or not you believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all</font>

over<font color="#E5E5E5"> hype to begin it's probably okay so</font>

116
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">write a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about vulnerability</font>

118
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,510

119
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,940
had been<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to patch before before the</font>

120
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,039
second outbreak and these percentages

121
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,390
don't line up directly with evidence

122
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,800
would include the connection timeout

123
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:04,610
connection to you so these are lower

124
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:10,490
bounds on the vulnerability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">patch these or forty percent ease hosts</font>

147
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,469
are still actively vulnerable

148
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,150
at that time probably another sixty

149
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,990
percent are still vulnerable but they've

150
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:15,179
changed IP addresses because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP so</font>

151
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,180
very little patching<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens I'd like to</font>

152
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,860
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these is you</font>

153
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,539
who fix things i'm wondering if they put

154
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,280
in a block that just filtered everything

155
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,710
they made everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense currently Cox's</font>

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,559
HTTP or something to protect their uses

157
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:34,979
or did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do something to to</font>

158
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:37,169
make people fix their systems so kind of

159
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,789
swing back to what people were saying on

160
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,460
the news that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only have to worry</font>

161
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,878
about worms if you're a big company and

162
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,650
obviously all these big viruses like

163
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,870
whatever is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure can whatever</font>

164
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,109
they're always affecting only companies

165
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:54,539
right not home users so that's what they

166
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,289
say so we noticed in some of the graphs

167
00:06:54,539 --> 00:07:00,120
that there's this diurnal pattern by

168
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:03,539
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this is daily cycle you can</font>

169
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,090
see it kind of clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day except</font>

00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">e-sourcing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notes every day there's these</font>

172
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,008
weekend so it goes back up on monday and

173
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,389
comes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the week and goes</font>

174
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,060
down on the weekend it goes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

175
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,889
week so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's clearly some sort of</font>

176
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,770
pattern of<font color="#CCCCCC"> posts coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in off the</font>

178
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well there's some hoes that aren't</font>

179
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,650
there but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them are there so</font>

180
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,110
we decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do was we use a geographic</font>

181
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,029
mapping service to look up the

182
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,129
geographic location of all the hosts of

183
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:33,750
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and we took a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> June</font>

184
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,870
wanted you to that and map it to a

185
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">timezone so we placed every host in its</font>

186
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:43,699
natural time zone and split them out by

187
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:47,279
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's pop curbs you can't see</font>

188
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:50,750
so two very large from like troughs of

189
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:53,190
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Peaks to hear right Sluggers of</font>

190
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:57,150
traffic and that's for JSP which is

191
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:59,400
japan standard time and you'll see a lot

192
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other lines for all the other well</font>

other large time zones and employee

194
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,940
every time zone there's this very large

195
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:07,259
daily pattern it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a few holes</font>

196

that are turning on and off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

197
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:13,379
it's a third to a half of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts are</font>

198
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:15,000
turning on and off every day we adjust

199
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,979
the time scale for the difference of

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,090
this Baratheon last graph is this one

201
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,859
has local time<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they've all been lined up into their</font>

203
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,560
local timezone and if you kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

204
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,990
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curves</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the peak of every day</font>

205

<font color="#E5E5E5">falling off at eight p.m. local time and</font>

207

212
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,140
machines that people expect to be

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,790
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> web servers or home machines</font>

214
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,410
their office machines they turn off and

215
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,900
they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> home at night and turn back on</font>

216
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,790
every morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> and these the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

217
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,779
have to be let known about these

218
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,819
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the future so now we know</font>

219
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's people turning machines on</font>

220
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,339
and off during the course of the day and

221
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,779
so this kind of leads to the question of

222
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,520
well do these machines always have the

223
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">same IP address when they get turned off</font>

224
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,779
and get turned back on because a lot of

225
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,140
these customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are cable modem users I</font>

226
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:15,450
to use with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Silas and one of the</font>

227
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,029
motivations of this is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked in any</font>

228
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,400
given time not that many hosting to be

229
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:23,730
actively trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spread well under</font>

230
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,040
180,000 but if you look over the whole

231
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,050
week we saw four million IP addresses in

232
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,849
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people are doing physics</font>

233
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,560
on on these large number of IP addresses

234
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,290
trying to do the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> breakdowns and</font>

235
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,029
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the problem we have</font>

236
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,860
is that there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain number of</font>

237
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:39,779
machines that are actually infected in

238
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,220
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a very small number relative</font>

239
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:44,010
to the total number of IP addresses

240
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,830
scene and the trick is how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

241
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what are the hosts and what are the</font>

242
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,480
IP addresses that those hoes might go

243
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,490
through over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course of the day I got</font>

244
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,459
a bit of a graph it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> confusing</font>

245
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:59,430
to me so I expectedly confusing to

246
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:03,000
someone else so this we did as we looked

247
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,640
in every / 24 and we counted how many IP

248
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,470
address as we saw in that / 24 that

249
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,050
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spread a worm over the</font>

250
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,760
entire week of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we</font>

251
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,050
also plotted the maximum number<font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw</font>

252
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to spread within a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two-hour</font>

253
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,339
period so<font color="#E5E5E5"> space what how many hosts are</font>

254
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:19,349
actively trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spread and how much</font>

255
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">did they how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many IP addresses they take</font>

256
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,670
by switching IP addresses over time so

257
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,620
the x axis will be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> total number</font>

258
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing the y axis will be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum</font>

259
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,980
number and in a two hour period its

260
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:33,319
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line on the x</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> equals y line</font>

261
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,880
and anything along that line basically

262
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,100
everything they're always had the same

263
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">IP address it wasn't moving around any</font>

264
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:43,160
and things that are below the IPS that

265
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">line or far below that line had a lot of</font>

266
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,870
dynamic addressing use like there was

267
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,139
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten host but they were shared among</font>

268
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,180
like 200 IP addresses and on the plot

269
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:54,589
you'll see the colors are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

270
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,670
represent intensities at the 3d

271
00:10:54,589 --> 00:11:03,529
histogram right there it is confusing

272
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is the line that anything</font>

273
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:08,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of along this line these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

microsoft / 24 anything along this line

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:15,439
are where the host<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that subnet that /</font>

276
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:17,750
24 if we're inspected and stayed on the

277
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,220
same IP addresses because over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

278
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,990
week they didn't move around any they

279
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,760
didn't change they got patched very

280
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:27,459
quickly and nothing else got caught in

281
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:30,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so that that's kind of good</font>

282
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:31,699
everything down here is roughly fine it

283
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,550
means that closer probably being patched

284
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,870
as they were found and they move down

285
