00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:08,849
all right good morning everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,780

sort of the edge problems this is gamma

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:33,420
so you know whether there are a lot of

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,790
edge problems the meltdowns of course

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,649
tended to happen as far as i can tell us

10

happening at the edges<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the multi</font>

casting actually performed really well

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,769
and it was a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> spike of traffic</font>

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,640
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our people's desire for news</font>

around now for myself sitting up in

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,410
Fairfax Virginia not too far from the

50
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,290
Pentagon what we first saw of the

51
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,170
multipath spike was actually a great

increased mimesis<font color="#E5E5E5"> contraction and it was</font>

so large about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten thirty or so we were</font>

59
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,190
I was getting emails from people in New

60
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,549
York that were saying effectively I have

61
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,859
no radio except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some am station I</font>

62
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,630
have no television I have no internet

63
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I can get anything internet hot</font>

64
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,850
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I go to get news I said well</font>

65
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:17,180
you get most activity

66
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming there ah this this is from fresh</font>

67
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,420

purple line is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one to look at that</font>

69
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:30,769
actually represents msdp traffic going

through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aida if the mass name is mixed</font>

71
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,830
and immediately after attack so it's

72
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:41,480
literally looking for this represents

73
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:43,430
multicast uses like multicast receivers

74
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,739
and cinders that are using the

75
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,970
descending traffic so receiver is only

76
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,240
going to do that if it's sending control

77
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,310
traffic which rtcp does send control

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,290
traffic so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would show up if there</font>

79
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a lot of silent receivers enter a</font>

80
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,560
sonic receiver there's really no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of</font>

81
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,780

and it came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very quickly this is</font>

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,240
historically pretty unusual he's mostly

85
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,319
a daytime effect actually like people

86
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,120
getting in from<font color="#E5E5E5"> their offices or</font>

87
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,190
something and then in the following days

88
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,798
there was a similar but not as

89
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,989
noticeable to some from it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again mostly</font>

90
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,989
during the US continental USA com

91
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright we went back and we looked at</font>

92
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,500
this and actually i looked at the

93
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,590
monitoring information<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi now which is</font>

94
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">not as frequently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> croissant and you see</font>

95
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:42,530
from three separate monitoring locations

96
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,980
there are pretty good coincidence and

97
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,690
the measure so it's pretty clear that

98
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,950
you know we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more or less amazing the</font>

99
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:55,670
same thing level or so msed make this

increasing network reliability and again

104
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:10,820
i'm basically immediately as soon as the

105
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:13,070
than an hour in nine and ten o'clock in

106

<font color="#E5E5E5">least a thousand fifteen hundred of</font>

111
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,229
those and that's where the gigabit is

112
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:31,100
something it's a long at historic flop

113
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:33,480
the same information you can see diurnal

114

cycle a lot of misses<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like</font>

115
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,560
and then back

116
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,030
sort of went to normal this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

119
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,128
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lyric system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a separate system</font>

120
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:56,639
for telling me TV viewership and that

121
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:59,250
was actually 830 people at a megabit

122

half a second let's if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> convince</font>

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">right there</font>

124
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,580
as far as we could tell and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is it</font>

125
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,580
it actually made us think very seriously

126
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,229
about monitoring multicast I'm just

127
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach ability but multiple faster</font>

128
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,860
performance in real time there is

129
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually some monitoring that going on</font>

130
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,210
though Mick with that but unfortunately

131
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,570
that information how are the archive and

132
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,340
so once it's gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> on taking seriously of</font>

133
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:27,090
a hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in history historical</font>

134
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,979
records available good idea but as far

135
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,710
as we could tell from from our location

136
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,540
and fairfax the multicast performed well

137
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,060
we sleep everywhere we tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

138
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">he got to you know we didn't see the</font>

139
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,000

140
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,190
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about from other people it was</font>

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,660
anecdotal of course we didn't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

142
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:50,910
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of complaints people don't</font>

144
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:57,479
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> those starting two days later</font>

145
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,850
problems and we were told this was the

length going over to europe that was not

151
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,960

169
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,050
after the attack actually looked at a

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,990
fairly detailed it's in the closet

171

175
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,330
tunnel with our friends over and the ECF

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amsterdam we put a thing that kind of</font>

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:35,490
we kind of done that at least in black

179
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:36,600
cloak it wasn't restored and so people

180
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,190
were trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> most guests</font>

connectivity through that single point

of failure would have had home so in

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">conclusion so I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and keep</font>

184
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,030
to the schedule here nothing I think

185
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,280
most cast has the real band that's in

186
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,140
the choir<font color="#E5E5E5"> performed really well we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">was a lot denial of service attack but</font>

189
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,410
there wasn't that was actually usage and

190
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,359
it saves quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> management and I</font>

191
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,500
think the other conclusion I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is if</font>

192
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,530
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going to start thinking</font>

196
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,640
then it really needs to date a lot more

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,339
monetary standpoint it's something we

use Sean

211
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:17,029
I mean you mentioned making the

212
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:23,660
multicast more robust by adding

213
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:26,449
additional measure appearing how easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

214
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:31,610
it to detect that the alternate path

exists through multicasts<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in advance</font>

216
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,699
from a static point it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font>

217
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,439
is you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MV GP will tell you how</font>

you know

the deeper problem of saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all your</font>

about some your<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide where you</font>

233
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:23,170
there is it simply a matter that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we now</font>

234
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,339
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring that to people's attention</font>

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:29,800
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't looking at that before or</font>

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,540
about ten percent of the polo on earth

241
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:46,900
and so you're basically doing that

242
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:49,300
within a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

I'm thank you again

yes sir can't see you but I'm right back

251
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:21,020
yeah several of us were wondering when

252
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:25,140
you did differently on the other days

253
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:28,949
now all the other days that's working

254
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:33,390
well well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know i mean not</font>

255
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:37,530
working well is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> white what you mean by</font>

256
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that multi casting has certain problems</font>

257
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,579
when it has certain advantages it was

258
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,070
designed to handle large spikes in

259
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:48,200

it's

also casting is new technology and month

263
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:02,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">no problem like a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of new</font>

264
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:05,699
technologies there's a certain learning

curve that's our experience certainly

266
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,000
that when you first get it going it

267
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:10,949
takes a purpose you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all</font>
