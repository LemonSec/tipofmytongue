00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:07,610
the interesting thing about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is most</font>

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,679
of the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> disruptions do not happen</font>

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:13,320
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately but during the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,670
the hours the days and weeks afterwards

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,320
so this was more like a rolling

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:23,640
hurricane type event than a single

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,840

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:37,079

00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,469
first off<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to go over some</font>

rumors<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty Hudson was structurally</font>

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,489

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,310
to try to look at some of the things

21
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,410
that had happened but it's very

22
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to tell what happened because</font>

23
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,989
a provider decided to upgrade their

24
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:15,079
routers that week and what happened

25
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:17,500
because something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened due to the</font>

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,160
events in New York or Pennsylvania or

27
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,720
Washington DC there was loss of

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,700
third-party infrastructure which makes

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,260
things kind of difficult because it

30
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,970
wasn't my<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure that was</font>

destroyed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the infrastructure i</font>

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,680
leased from someone who leased from

33
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,480
someone who was destroyed so it's very

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,239
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

36
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,549
errors and omissions turned out to be a

37
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,070
tremendous problem that week several<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

38
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:48,260
the things that when you finally track

39
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,970
it back to what happened it turns out

40
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,790
someone turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> something off or unplug</font>

something or change them

42
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:58,709
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> it got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blamed on lots of other</font>

things including the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infamous there</font>

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:12,000
blamed on that generally that was just

00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,150
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a primary cause for the problem but</font>

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,129
maybe at most a contributing cause

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,709
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually the direct damage</font>

50
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,959

pretty well just by accident and by luck

the next taco I'll go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,119
about the data that the matrix<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nets</font>

00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:43,489
collected by this one I briefly go over

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,890
this to show you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just one</font>

58
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,230
week and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

59
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,440
initial event which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

60
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:54,349
large spike there there were problems

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,730
coming and going on words after that

62
00:03:54,349 --> 00:04:00,649
point but overall the network really

63
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,899
wasn't that bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been much worst</font>

64
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,900
events in the history of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

70
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,830
some technologies that we thought were

71
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,300
gone came back to life like a ricochet

72
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:33,000
turns out they brought that back up in

New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> City</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works great and it</font>

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,470
turned out that exchange points work

75
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,060
really well several of the European

know the network probably works the best

84
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,639
is because the spam kept on coming
