1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
hi so if I had known that there's

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,740
somebody going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:17,310
introduction to know bad I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:24,448
call this introduction to no good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:25,890
so this is the agenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> for today the</font>

6
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:31,619
first thing I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start with his</font>

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:33,480
IP and IP is just good enough it was not

8
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,760
well architected it was not worked out

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,919
in detail if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISO model</font>

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,530
and you know he's wonderful seven layers

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,680
and everything sitting nicely it's not

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,739
quite the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as IP you have the</font>

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,539
network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the transport then you</font>

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,538
got stuff below and you have stuff above

15
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,570
and you're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work and doesn't</font>

16
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,690
always line up nicely but the big thing

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,750
is we didn't want well I shouldn't say

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,480
we because I had no part of that but the

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,610
guys who did it and said we can't

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,770
predict the future let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just make it</font>

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,420
reasonable flexible and extensible and

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:15,229
just deal with things does it happen I'm

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,979
sure you know talk about dealers today

24
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:21,960
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought of this 15-20 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

25
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:26,729
the fact is if you build it good enough

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,500
and and you keep your options open then

27
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,400
you can deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the changes that occur</font>

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,320
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this because in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,290
while we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to a different way of doing</font>

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:42,960
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well we get there so I PHR</font>

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,329
off the big apps in IP were emails a

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,610
long time ago and simple data services

33
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,649
like FTP and use and now you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

34
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of funny things and sunny starts</font>

35
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,610
happening on it you got the web you got

36
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,908
voice with its realty and requirements

37
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,680
we've got video very large amounts of

38
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,290
traffic small amounts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> classic that</font>

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,020
need to get there absolutely you've got

40
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,600
essays and raise the service you know

41
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,109
you've got calluses and and and quality

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,120
and everything so I p is just good

43
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,140
enough and the IP control plane is also

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,870
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> good enough</font>

45
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,149
but he is it's flexible extensible we

46
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,470
did DB routing for a long time while it

47
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,100
was good nothing was good enough and

48
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,410
when it wasn't we did link stage now

49
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,410
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask arm is convergence in just a</font>

50
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,090
few seconds good enough and you know the

51
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:36,459
answer is well if you need it in

52
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:38,650
subseconds we get there because the key

53
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,530
is good enough can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> better if you</font>

54
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,720
want fast convergence subseconds we can

55
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,760
get this if you want also<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast you want</font>

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,800
to do it in 50 milliseconds because you

57
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,410
know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> magic number we can get</font>

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,840
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> too people are talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

59
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:56,109
bulletproof IP and so we have a bunch of

60
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,650
work in the IETF on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp front on the</font>

61
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,080
bgp plant talking about hitless restart

62
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,600
the router goes down comes up and keeps

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,600
going and no one knew the difference in

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,040
that business I be saying look we need

65
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,329
stuff to make us money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to lose</font>

66
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,760
this money and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get this so that's</font>

67
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,940
IP there's a different way of doing

68
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,910
things of ATM let's do everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

69
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,870
let's move perfectly let's anticipate

70
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,160
yum put everyone in these five

71
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,530
adaptation layers and say this is how

72
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,019
everything lines up let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do it</font>

73
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,720
right and so it's a big philosophical

74
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:38,080
mismatch of IT people talk about you

75
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,080
know IP and ATM and integrating them and

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,549
stuff and the first thing ever realizes

77
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:48,519
they're trying to marry two different

78
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:51,489
philosophies so if ATM is frame relay on

79
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,109
steroids which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've heard often then</font>

80
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:58,299
mpls is ATM unhappy juice

81
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:00,670
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic idea is it has to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

82
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,409
good enough and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plenty of people out</font>

83
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,888
there we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make it perfect</font>

84
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:10,239
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF and at least some people in</font>

85
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:12,219
the IDF are saying no don't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's</font>

86
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,209
an IP control plane it's an IP

87
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:20,108
philosophy so what you know what is mpls

88
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:23,169
mpls is basically three things<font color="#CCCCCC"> tunnel</font>

89
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:25,359
the icon account<font color="#CCCCCC"> in online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as its</font>

90
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:28,210
tunnels<font color="#E5E5E5"> its explicit routing and it's a</font>

91
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,630
label stack layer independence<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only</font>

92
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:34,539
bring up because of ATM IP is also later

93
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,039
to independence but in in a lot of

94
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:39,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">situations it's important to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

95
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:43,479
two independent so what do you want

96
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:45,969
tunnels well if you cannot IP route so

97
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,039
you have non IP packets and you want to

98
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,460
get them<font color="#E5E5E5"> from point A to point B you</font>

99
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:54,699
need a tunnel and if you can IP route

100
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,219
but there's private IP addresses you

101
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably want to use tunnels there the</font>

102
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,639
other reason is that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

103
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,610
IP route and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who talk about</font>

104
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,440
a BGP freak or just because bgp is this

105
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,229
complex protocol and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

106
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,820
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on so maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to run</font>

107
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,740
bgp on the edge and you don't want to

108
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">write it in the core and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other thing</font>

109
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">is multicast and I shouldn't make fun of</font>

110
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,610
multicast but a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't want</font>

111
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:22,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run native multicast in their course</font>

112
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:26,889
so how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do tunnels well if you'll</font>

113
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:30,699
mpls you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> LEP and if your IP you</font>

114
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:32,800
can do I pee 90 which is IP nit or you

115
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:35,349
can do GRE which is more general general

116
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,580
purpose you can do I pee sex and there's

117
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:41,320
this thing that I'm not supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

118
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,030
about called UTI and an important

119
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,099
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you're doing tunnels in</font>

120
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,080
a single channel from point A to point B

121
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:49,599
do multiple things so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

122
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,270
notion of the tunnel demultiplexers if

123
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:54,099
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a different tunnel for</font>

124
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,080
every use that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it to it</font>

125
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,610
could get unscalable pretty quickly but

126
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,490
if you have a single tunnel from point A

127
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,770
to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> B and say everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that wants</font>

128
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,449
to get from A to B uses this tunnel and

129
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,330
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this other field inside the</font>

130
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">tunnel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

131
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,500
you know what service are actually doing

132
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:13,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> useful for</font>

133
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,990
scalability so let's let's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

134
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,210
kind of assuming that you I mean

135
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,740
introduction to<font color="#CCCCCC"> no no good at one thing</font>

136
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,030
but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> assuming you know something but</font>

137
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:26,960
mpls if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp tunnels you have a</font>

138
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:30,590
small header the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LDP the MPLS head is</font>

139
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,568
like four bytes and if you do IP it's a

140
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit bigger and it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be an</font>

141
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:37,580
issue but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a difference you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

142
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:42,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">labels packing in mpls and you have no</font>

143
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:45,590
stacking in IP now it might not be a

144
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:48,979
huge deal because you do have protocols

145
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,219
like GRE that can carry and fill us with

146
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:54,378
in them and inherit a label<font color="#E5E5E5"> size and</font>

147
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:56,770
your protocols like UTI which can carry

148
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:59,360
a demultiplexer and if you don't need a

149
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,520
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole stack what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just need a</font>

150
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,270
tunnel and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> demultiplexers and UTI</font>

151
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,159
would be fine you also need signaling

152
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,469
for the demons you need to say at both

153
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:11,990
hands you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this we must be</font>

155
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">service and there is no signaling and IP</font>

156
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:24,139
yet but there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the pw III</font>

157
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:26,000
working group in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF on this one</font>

158
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,460
thing what LDP's you get is automatic

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,629
tunnels you just tell every all your

160
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:36,138
edge routers run<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp and you get tunnels</font>

161
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:38,270
everywhere and you in IP so far the

162
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,279
tunnels are configured and this is not a

163
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,479
huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem because you can fix it but</font>

164
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:47,060
right now it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue with great</font>

165
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,120
difficulty<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp channel follow IP routing</font>

166
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:54,199
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of trivial for IP to</font>

167
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,360
follow IP routing right now maybe

168
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">because people haven't thought about it</font>

169
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,860
and worked on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mpls is hard to school</font>

170
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:07,879
but I p is clearly crucible emptiness

171
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,250
has no data security ipsec is can be

172
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,500
used if you want tons of security so the

173
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,199
bottom line on tunnels is you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

174
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,719
mpls the tunnels but they have some nice

175
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,160
properties and so you need to sort of

176
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:21,590
sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and decide</font>

177
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,200
self what's the cost of deploying a new

178
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:28,609
protocol such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp and what are the</font>

179
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,039
benefits i get the other thing that mpls

180
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,830
has is explicit loading and you could

181
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,539
use this for traffic engineering class

182
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,479
results guaranteed bandwidth and

183
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:42,260
probably a whole bunch of other users

184
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:46,340
now in when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was suggesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I give</font>

185
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stock you know somebody asked me how</font>

186
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:52,160
much truth how you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell it's</font>

187
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,829
a very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> question so I decided all of</font>

188
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,790
you guys need three handfuls of salt and

189
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,350
you need the first handful right now

190
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,290
it's my claim that connection oriented

191
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,630
paradigm fits nicely with IPS connection

192
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:11,780
listeners kick this with one handful of

193
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:13,820
salt so people ask is ATM a good way of

194
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing traffic engineering or is it mpls</font>

195
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,750
or chemistry with IP and the first

196
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,390
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should really ask is do I</font>

197
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,010
need traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering if I need</font>

198
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,449
traffic edging where my network do I

199
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,830
need it do I need in the code when you

200
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:30,800
the edge to edge so I needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> end to end</font>

201
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:33,380
don't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but that's actually the</font>

202
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,449
first question and it's too easy to get

203
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,400
sucked into launching what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

204
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,110
way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you don't you know ask</font>

205
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,020
whether you need in the first place

206
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,760
you're going down the wrong path but

207
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,530
suppose you say you do need it the first

208
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,710
thing you have to do is figure out how

209
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:51,620
you put your your traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

210
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical topology and to do this you</font>

211
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,530
measure traffic patterns and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

212
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:01,010
crunch it through some fancy program

213
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,810
usually in power and you figure out

214
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,920
where things you need to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

215
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,630
second thing is you have to convince the

216
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">packets to follow the great plan that</font>

217
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:12,110
you just made so you can do this with

218
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:14,510
bgp you can do this with<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp by playing</font>

219
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,240
with metrics you can do it by sorcery

220
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:19,670
which is a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people did with ATM</font>

221
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,560
and frame relay and the new thing you

222
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:26,800
could do is with mpls again this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

223
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,329
second handful of salt that you need

224
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">fines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and traffic engineering needs some</font>

225
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,670
form of source files

226
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,350
and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things if you do so</font>

227
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:39,010
shouting one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get is</font>

228
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,170
you can change it's a given<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow without</font>

229
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,630
changing anything else because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say</font>

230
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,280
from from point A to point B I want you

231
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this path and then you change</font>

232
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to a different path and you haven't</font>

233
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,479
affected any other traffic whereas if

234
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do things like flavors metrics you</font>

235
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,660
have to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the change</font>

236
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,240
that you made effect just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route that</font>

237
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,630
you did and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the other parts for</font>

238
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,590
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this applies even more</font>

239
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:09,490
when you have a link failure so so

240
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:13,030
starting helps and so starting is is is

241
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:15,610
useful the hell there was a paper some

242
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:18,699
time ago about using linear programming

243
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:21,430
to go from a traffic pattern traffic

244
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,010
matrix that you have two metrics on your

245
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,870
links and this is my

246
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,000
back-of-the-envelope calculations of

247
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,190
what it would take to actually is under

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,440
linear program we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> N squared see</font>

249
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,120
details you set up an N square by n

250
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,070
square matrix it's already looking a

251
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,050
little big now you do matrix

252
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,840
multiplication well let's enter the

253
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,180
sixth<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and then if you actually run</font>

254
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,010
simplex for doing linear programming you

255
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,660
need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of matrix multiplication so</font>

256
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,390
you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly large problem</font>

257
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:52,030
no I might have gotten my numbers wrong

258
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,800
but it's a pretty large problem just to

259
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what metrics you need to put</font>

260
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,959
on your length and when you're done<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

261
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">this it says oh we have this little</font>

262
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,030
problem we have something called sloop

263
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,830
droughts or some such things which are

264
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,920
loopy locks I think was returned to use

265
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:12,460
and you can deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that but you don't</font>

266
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,560
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with it so my take is and</font>

267
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:19,360
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like i said handful of</font>

268
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:22,449
salt you want source routing and it's

269
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,670
much easier to say you you run your

270
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,190
magic program that says how to map your

271
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,240
traffic on the physical quality and then

272
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,000
you just say these are the exclusive

273
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,680
drops I'm done you don't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a</font>

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,150
second step that says computer whole

275
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,400
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of metrics and put them on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

276
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,930
trousers<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh by the way a link went down</font>

277
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,850
computer new set of metrics for the one

278
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:43,959
your routers and these are non civil

279
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,100
computations another thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could use</font>

280
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,730
explicit

281
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,550
working for is fast freedom and as usual

282
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,620
the question from you know can-am pls

283
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,680
read out as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as sonic which is 50</font>

284
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,200
milliseconds can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> p 0 as far as MPLS</font>

285
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,959
and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you lost track of the problem</font>

286
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,330
the first question is do you really need

287
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,840
50 milliseconds and depends what data

288
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:10,150
what traffic is carrying but once you

289
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">get over that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and define how fast fast</font>

290
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:18,300
is the question then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask is can I</font>

291
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:22,260
Ruiz out quickly without you know

292
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,000
telling my network into a porridge and

293
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:29,920
the third question is if I do all these

294
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,590
things how well does it scale if you do

295
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:38,740
fast without with IP and there are

296
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:40,600
efforts to do this thank you all those

297
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,540
must be total failure because all nodes

298
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:47,590
must we converge and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide will</font>

299
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:50,140
show you why you<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so that all those</font>

300
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:52,390
need all those who learn of the failure

301
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need fast propagation and fast SPF</font>

302
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,610
triggers which means doesn't worry about

303
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,500
stability if a link is flapping up and

304
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,080
down you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very careful how you</font>

305
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,730
dance that but it when you're done

306
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,600
you're done when all notes of the

307
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:10,390
converts your dance that's it the faster

308
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,340
your techniques with mpls the nice thing

309
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that is only the two ends of the</font>

310
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,660
nodes of the link that fail need to know

311
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,120
that it's down so you don't need any

312
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,930
signaling and the local operation should

313
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:27,100
be to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic onto a separate path</font>

314
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:28,719
so it's a lot more stable but it is a

315
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-step process this is a good pitch</font>

316
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,320
with a band-aid and when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

317
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this you want your ID be to</font>

318
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,130
converge and one side igt support

319
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,959
converges then you want to remove the

320
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:42,730
bandage the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

321
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,560
if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this very simple network</font>

322
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,140
they've got ABC and you got these links

330
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:08,500
comes to faster abusing IT whereas the

331
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,949
few dead files and<font color="#CCCCCC"> PL ask you to have an</font>

332
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,450
explicit path from A to B to C and the

333
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,880
package<font color="#E5E5E5"> should just go to be without</font>

336
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,190
guaranteed bandwidth is a service that a

337
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,160
lot of people up offer at layer 2 and

338
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,290
it's a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you might want to</font>

339
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,510
offer at layer 3 and again the first

340
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is do you need it but if you do</font>

341
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,650
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the third handful of salt</font>

342
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,600
you need source routing you need College

343
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:44,410
Mission Control and you need some way of

344
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,840
signaling them<font color="#CCCCCC"> all so you could can do</font>

345
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,069
this and it remains to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen how well</font>

346
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,210
I'm sure ATM could have done it better

347
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,670
there's a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of services that</font>

348
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:56,920
are called mpls services and the first

349
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,740
one is I PvP ms which is a big favorite

350
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,780
here and then you have later to transfer

351
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,380
later VPNs transparent land services

352
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:07,180
which is the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font>

353
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,000
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about and you have</font>

354
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,890
TDM over mpls of a TDM over people get a

355
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,990
bit carried away at points there's

356
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,310
actually just wonderful draft that you

357
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,120
should read about how you transport

358
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,979
electricity using photons the thing

359
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">about all these is venabili mpls</font>

360
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,600
services are really tunnel services but

361
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mpls geeks were</font>

362
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,780
responsible sorry some of these services

363
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,420
are enhanced by sorting so for example

364
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,220
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about Leigh to transport or</font>

365
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,479
later to VPNs you might want to say

366
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,070
guaranteed bandwidth along with that and

367
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,100
this is why you know at the front of the

368
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:47,590
slide i said this<font color="#CCCCCC"> service is double</font>

369
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,260
espresso you might get more revenue you

370
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,430
might be more just coming to work but

371
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,689
you could also<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay up at night worrying</font>

372
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:59,920
about these things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zevon you that's</font>

373
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:04,270
what it's all about right RFC 2547 I'm

374
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,190
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> glad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Randy's not years it's a new</font>

375
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,510
service and it's a very recent

376
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,750
deployment we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether it'll</font>

377
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,940
make money or not and the question for

378
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,280
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> is do we give it a shot or</font>

379
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,200
do we run like hell<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know Randy's</font>

380
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,879
answers and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are saying</font>

381
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,950
no we just wait that's someone else

382
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,110
suffer and then we'll figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how we</font>

383
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,790
jump in there to VPN to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slightly</font>

384
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,129
different so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an all-service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

385
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:29,409
lots of revenues lots of deployment

386
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,680
question is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put this over a new</font>

387
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,830
transport is it good enough we won't

388
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,810
give you the same service as a pure

389
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,320
frame relay<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world or pure ATM</font>

390
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,580
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> would but is it good enough and</font>

391
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,070
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> question for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all all the</font>

392
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,139
services which would think of I mean is

393
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,090
it worth putting this in your networks

394
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">would it give you revenue and what's the</font>

395
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:57,310
cost in terms of transitioning your

396
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:59,590
network points to ponder can good enough

397
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,139
IP stay ahead of the curve can it get

398
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:05,080
better better fast enough to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

399
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,030
all the stresses put on it fast

400
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,120
convergence new services etcetera

401
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,850
etcetera I'm not here to tell you yes

402
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,770
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not here to say no personally I</font>

403
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,090
think it's it it will but it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

404
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,610
question that you guys have answered

405
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:22,480
yourself but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other question is even</font>

406
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:25,120
if it can can mpls help is mpls a

407
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,900
support or is it a crutch or is it a

408
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,909
banana peel in the way of IP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

409
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,340
here to say I'm just here today<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

410
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,020
person for you guys to answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

412
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,610
addition to the national psyche like I

413
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:43,570
said you know my<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion you have the</font>

414
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:45,189
fistful of salt go for it the other big

415
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,070
question is what other services should

416
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:54,160
you offer if any when and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how far should</font>

417
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:55,870
you go so having given you the start you

418
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,360
need to know where I'm coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from I'm a</font>

419
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:03,969
vendor for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that means a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">lot mpls each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol 680m</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

421
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:09,090
particularly like or dislike IP rules

422
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,820
and I see control<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane especially</font>

423
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:15,929
schools but I'm reasonably agnostic pay

424
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,929
me enough and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll do to you</font>

crescent

426
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,309
just one clarification you had a slide I

427
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,199
don't know if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pitch back</font>

428
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:39,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">really fast it had two comparisons of</font>

00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:42,679
mpls and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I eat tunnels or something like</font>

430

431
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:49,860
but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you passed it right there I</font>

432
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,900
think when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking about</font>

433
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:55,260
signaling for<font color="#CCCCCC"> dmax and no signaling yet</font>

434
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:58,260
you mentioned the ogres every week 3 is

435
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,820
developing a signaling of some pork for

436
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,158
tunneling and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a little</font>

437
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,620
incorrect it's not charter to do so it's

438
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,919
not charter to create any new signaling

439
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,469
for setup of tunnels<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to go</font>

440
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:14,130
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eyes you have to organ and read</font>

441
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:17,669
that and also in general as far as

442
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:20,010
tunneling technologies running<font color="#CCCCCC"> over IP</font>

443
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:23,760
there's a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been using</font>

444
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:27,179
signaling for some time this isn't

445
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,250
something that's particularly unique 10

446
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:31,169
kilo talking about to pee-pee well this

447
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">is one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be able to DB</font>

448
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:37,200
stamped on my head but mobile IP is is

449
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:39,330
signaling and it does IP funneling lttp

450
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,860
of course does signaling and it's got

451
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:46,830
label kind of things you probably think

452
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,020
of some more that also<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been</font>

453
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,299
defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ITF that have some sort</font>

455
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:56,039
of the tunnel so I should out as

456
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,870
Rebecca's one there is signaling set up

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tunnel mean that you may be</font>

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,559
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on policy and such but</font>

459
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,360
there's definitely a signaling plane

460
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:08,899
yeah so that's just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

461
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,309
misleading there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if this</font>

462
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a small point maybe in your</font>

473
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,840
for tunneling protocols that run over IP

474
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,668
including

475
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,830
ctp but I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to run up here and</font>

476
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:45,809
just start waving an l2tp flag that

could<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe some of those that know me</font>

thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I agree that it's creating the</font>

480
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,168
geometry that you put on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network</font>

481
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,928
that's just an IP network without mpls

482
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:05,580
can be complicated i'm surprised frankly

483
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:08,010
to date there hasn't been more research

484
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,559
about how to sort of do out heuristic

485
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:13,379
applied algorithms to do that that's

486
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">also why the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bandwidth traders dream of</font>

487

turning up OC 48<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 10 minutes and just</font>

490
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:24,000
thing that confuses me about mpls is

491
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,340
tunnel placement how do you figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

492
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,549
how to configure that because it seems

493
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:32,100
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is just as art</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

494
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:34,049
you know Yura<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 in the human mind as</font>

00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:39,029
in particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worry that I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

497
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:40,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taste place tunnels</font>

498
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:42,510
based on what the traffic normally is

499
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,890
what the suppose normally are and when

500
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,629
you actually have outages how do you

501
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,360
actually know what the flows will be and

502
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,610
it seems that in some ways basic IT with

503
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,520
the standard geometry problems that well

504
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:55,168
familiar with might feel better than

505
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,270
that it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel better with those</font>

506
00:22:55,169 --> 00:23:00,270
types of situations and I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

507
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,668
seen a lot of upside intelligent

00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,770
analysis about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens any times of</font>

509
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:06,960
failure with the problems of sort of

humans<font color="#E5E5E5"> just placing tunnels you know if</font>

513
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,260
is when you when you defined if you're

514
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,350
using tunnels for for traffic

515
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,090
engineering you<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically you know where</font>

516
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,649
it starts and where it ends and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

517
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:29,100
to know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to place it on your physical</font>

518
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:30,899
topology so what you do is you sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

519
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">and figure out where to put the traffic</font>

520
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:35,489
in the best case where all your links

521
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:37,379
are working and then you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

522
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,409
alternate path where any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the links</font>

523
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,860
there fail and you can slip from one to

524
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:45,450
the other did I not hit your questions I

525
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,719
guess let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just give an applied</font>

526
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:51,419
example I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build mostly 48 from</font>

527
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,049
LA to Chicago because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have fears that</font>

528
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,119
I preference in Chicago and I have

529
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:57,519
be sending them lots of traffic my

530
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,590
physical pathology actually stays the

531
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,809
same but the provider is having a med

532
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,369
problem and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> honor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> med so they're</font>

533
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">having a more specific problem where</font>

534
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:07,090
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having some problem and the</font>

535
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:09,549
circuit goes down and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to now send</font>

536
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,230
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my external traffic to Seattle</font>

537
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:14,168
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually know that because</font>

538
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:16,149
my flows don't normally go that way but

539
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:18,460
meanwhile I've just reserved potentially

540
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:19,959
a huge amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage to Chicago for</font>

541
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,809
something that I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually talking</font>

542
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,210
to in Chicago it seems that that kind of

543
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:27,399
regression analysis often isn't done or

544
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,340
there is no sort of methodology around

545
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:32,590
that just as there is and in situations

546
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,830
like that in some ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of</font>

547
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:38,529
gross geometry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that IV works</font>

548
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:39,789
handles that better so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an</font>

549
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:42,789
example of the kind of thing I'm talking

550
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:45,580
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that I'd</font>

551
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:47,590
be handled it better because everyone

552
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,350
just runs to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tribez path and you get</font>

553
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:52,869
congestion but it's definitely something

554
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:56,019
we should look at in the context of mpls

555
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:58,809
I think we should also look at in the

556
00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:01,710
context of IT but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have so much</font>

557
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:01,710
less control an IP

558
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:22,360
I'm sorry I'll keep it on oh well I did

559
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,010
have an observation that there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

560
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,600
there's not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling there's a</font>

561
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">belief that it was autumn automatic</font>

562
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,250
tunnels and again since there's been

563
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,168
signaling on IP for a long time for

564
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:35,080
tunnels there's been automatic magic

565
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:36,669
tunnels for some protocols and then it

566
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it boils down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to when you do the</font>

567
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:39,730
comparison the one that's very

568
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,580
significant you have down at the bottom

569
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:45,450
there's security or notated security

570
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,309
then there's hard to suit under mpls

571
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:50,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">which spoof under IP so there's there's</font>

572
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:52,178
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of differences there and then</font>

573
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:54,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">it becomes as its officers there's</font>

574
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:55,330
header differences and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff in the</font>

575
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,140
middle really isn't that much different

576
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:02,559
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like header differences and</font>

577
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,490
smooth and hard to spoof that's someone

578
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,320
that there's a whole lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

579
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,720
security can probably come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there and</font>

580
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why mpls would be</font>

581
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,100
impossible dispute no one said it

582
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:15,129
possible for the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

583
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,230
could depending on how you watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

584
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,330
mpls for<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your network you couldn't</font>

585
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,970
you could say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't allow any mpls</font>

586
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:24,490
traffic into my network so mpls it's

587
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,659
only local to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whereas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

588
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,880
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you said you're not letting any</font>

589
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:29,679
IP traffic into your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you</font>

590
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,419
you're classifying a type of traffic and

591
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can do that with filters as well yeah</font>

592
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:37,390
Mon IP sure and just it's maybe the

593
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">spoofing has to do it in order to send</font>

594
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,799
traffic you've got to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through a</font>

595
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:46,559
signaling stage to set it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

596
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:49,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">the with IP you don't necessarily so</font>

597
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,450
it's not a question that IP is

598
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:54,960
impossible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make spoof or mpls is</font>

599
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,190
impossible to spoof the question is if

600
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,340
it's a matter of degree of difference

601
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:04,299
and pls right now is hard to spoof and

602
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:06,340
IP is that is easier to school and the

603
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:07,600
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to let IP traffic into</font>

604
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,658
your network so you have to do a lot

605
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">more work to to detect spoofing whereas</font>

606
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:16,570
for mpls the easy thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to say not I</font>

607
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,639
don't let this kind of my network as for

608
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:22,270
control traffic you know you have all

609
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,830
kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques to prevent you know</font>

610
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:28,070
md sy authentication or whatever so

611
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,809
the signaling stuff doesn't come in you

612
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,689
know because that's that's a lot

613
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:34,399
different yeah okay well this can of

614
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,630
course be taken offline but it just

615
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:42,760
seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that it's kind of boiled</font>

616
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:42,760
down the headers sure thank you
