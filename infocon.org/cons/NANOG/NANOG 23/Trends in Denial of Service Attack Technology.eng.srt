I'd like to point out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the loan on net</font>

00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:59,139
we're not seeing much in the way of

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,590
permutations have been haven't tried so

454
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:22,950
the ones that work for other ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

456
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,779
unfortunately we're not seeing a much

457
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,789
decrease in launch point availability<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

used to launch attacks and other systems

00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,100
is still high

462
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:46,100
the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> of announcing vulnerabilities</font>

463
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:50,080
and patches for vulnerabilities and

464
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,279
getting the globe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to install patches is</font>

465
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,549
not a real effective model however

466
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:57,830
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state of the art the</font>

vulnerability life cycle we still see we

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:03,529
still see systems compromised three

469
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:05,959
vulnerabilities that that were past

three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago that's that's that's</font>

471
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:13,249
actually pretty typical based on on the

472
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:15,110
data that we that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gather much the</font>

more is actually contain and paper that

475
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:24,559
was published Friday this past Friday

476
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,389
it's available<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the cert website the</font>

along Rob Thomas and George Weaver

478
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:34,879
contributed quite a bit paper in fact

Rob and George are here today in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

next couple of days<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is seeing</font>

once you guys raise<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hand there you</font>

00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:45,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see us wandering around the hallways</font>

483
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:47,570
and have any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> regarding any of</font>

484
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:51,008
the stuff feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask and we have a</font>

485
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,009
minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> of to update some questions now</font>

486
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:28,250
just curious some if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is any</font>

487
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,189
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's going to be stitch</font>

488
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:35,000
at any point from demonstrating what can

489
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,760
be done to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do damage and it</font>

490
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,340
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been fortunate that</font>

491
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,160
most of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks so far have just</font>

492
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:46,040
demonstrated vulnerabilities haven't

493
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:50,840
really done anything damaging in terms

494
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:54,379
of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything is on machines to</font>

495
00:24:50,840 --> 00:25:00,260
compromise or taking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little down other</font>

496
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:02,870
than maybe some so excited kids curious

497
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:09,640
if there's any any indication about

498
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:13,729
going to change in the near future sure

499
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:18,160
question repeat was before see any

500
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,160
change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess I'm going to rephrase a little</font>

502
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,789
bit in the deployment technology to

503
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:26,949
actually cause<font color="#CCCCCC"> damage to delete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

504
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:28,269
office systems or do something other

505
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:32,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">than just properly am i understanding</font>

506
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:32,669
your question correctly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

507
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:44,980
it's speculation that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually don't</font>

508
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:48,429
speculate a whole lot with the I would

509
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:51,100
expect I would expect some of the high

510
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:52,870
automation techniques to eventually

511
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,059
result in things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause greater</font>

512
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:59,709
damage than just deployment or just

513
00:25:55,059 --> 00:26:06,460
propagation I won't go into into

514
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:07,840
specific style on giving that's

515
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,200
certainly something to be prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

516
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,360
as was disgusting yesterday on one of

517
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,059
yesterday's tutorials preparations half

518
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,789
the battle it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be aware of</font>

519
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:21,820
what the attack trains are so that you

520
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:25,990
can involve security policies procedures

521
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:30,100
and be prepared as best as possible yes

522
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:32,559
sir yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said that ha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a big</font>

not one point guessing the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

Colbie to on july nine teams so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

of software vulnerabilities in love
