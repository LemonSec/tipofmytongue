wave<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim and please hang on with us</font>

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,810
because at the end will tell you how you

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">can join this collaboration and look at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your data as well so how we have been</font>

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:30,479
are exploring and I think succeeding are

9
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:35,399
in finding ways to look at very many

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,770
ongoing vgp sessions dynamically me real

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,489
time and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found some strange</font>

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,480
things coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Redmond about</font>

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,199
here is the outline generally are people

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,840
who study large dynamical systems have

16
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,430
pretty well founded claims that if you

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,320
build something very large and very

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,510
complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not so to speak</font>

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,820
such as for instance caused by router

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,890
misconfigurations and say that they had

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:46,648
a global reach and can last hours as

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:49,560
well sometimes days so let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in</font>

36
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,500
this talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> given the time constraints I</font>

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">will talk mostly about data taken from</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RC 0 0 collection point at Amsterdam</font>

40
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,619
the reason is the best an interesting

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,860

Paris Geneva London and the new one in

49
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:35,100
Japan we have analyzed them all but I'll

50
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:37,440
talk mostly about Amsterdam and CC so

51
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,600
anyway for people who look at traffic

52
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,090
it's customary so to speak to look at

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,180
the rate of message arrivals and then do

54
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,380
various things on it for pgp doesn't

55
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,080
quite work I mean you can see big spikes

56
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,940
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see at 30-second Vince</font>

57
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,570
occasionally collecting all message

58
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,579
traffic to the RR c 00 collection router

59
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,260
we may get something like you know

60
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:07,709
50,000 or 100,000 say our messages

61
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,149
coming from 12 years per minute the big

62
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,400
spikes but they are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> terribly</font>

63
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,930
informative right we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,500
what's inside because that's where the

65
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">museum's so let's look at different way</font>

66
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,580
at the same set of messages that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,560
showed you again aggregated<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's from</font>

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,019
the point of view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all bgp messages</font>

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,510
coming to the router now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I plot it on a</font>

logarithmic scale look<font color="#E5E5E5"> carefully and</font>

71
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,010
notice what happens instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> go terra</font>

72
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,880
da da da da if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> carefully you</font>

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">will see a week diurnal cycles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> screw up with a net and</font>

75
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,739
they go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sleep and then enough</font>

76
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:46,829
substandard 18 it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> like kaboom okay</font>

77
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,510
in two<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours there is about 25 growth</font>

78
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,000
and if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> more carefully at</font>

79
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,609
exponential growth in the rate of

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,190
traffic's announcements and then it's

81
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,650
linguists and sort of slowly

82
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,930
exponentially decays over four days now

83
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,630
that's bad but<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this level of</font>

84
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">aggregation of data we can tell if its</font>

85
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:10,500
global or just some local problem okay

86
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:14,250
and we have to kiss the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> part it's</font>

87
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,488
as much greater level of detail so what

88
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,700
we will ask looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll start looking</font>

89
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:23,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">at behavior and correlating data among</font>

90
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,539

point

92
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,050
we'll look at is there something

93
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,530
specific about origin areas say that

94
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:37,740
causes instabilities added some special

95
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,650
set of prefixes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause instabilities</font>

96
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the time special critics lengths</font>

97
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,599
that cause instability<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we will</font>

98
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,580
also look hey maybe throughout life

99
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,070
science change a lot and we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

100
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,229
of very short-lived routes during its

101
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,420
abilities and otherwise everything is

102
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,610
stunted ended and that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a big</font>

103
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,980
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how we analyze the data and</font>

104
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,230
again I will not show everything we can

105
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,560
sit down in after the talk how time

106
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:07,940
permitting and go over some<font color="#CCCCCC"> details so I</font>

107
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,320
let's look first how does it look when I

108

114
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,000

146
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:20,680
something happening simultaneously

147
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:23,020
across very many autonomous systems are

148
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,780
in this case hearing sessions from those

149
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,849
autonomous systems and I recall<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font>

150
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,150
recall we had big guys there's barrier

151
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:34,750
AT&T global crossing and so forth it

152
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,549
will show us wait going<font color="#E5E5E5"> across and he'll</font>

153
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,780
they look like ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there is</font>

154
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,400
something that's happening here

155
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,409
something that's happening here if

156
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">something really big is happening here</font>

157
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:47,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay notice the scale the scale is</font>

158
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:51,009
retailer to the highest peaks which are

159
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:53,139
isolated events but this wave here you

160
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:56,199
see is quite large it starts on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

161
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:58,030
September 18 and it goes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

162
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,380
figure for about day and a half but in

163
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,989
the previous picture showed it really

164
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,810
goes for the four days so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

165
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,180
very long<font color="#CCCCCC"> tailed very powerful events</font>

166
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:12,880
what is it well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is it I'll</font>

167
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:16,180
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we find it this is</font>

168
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,889
separately collected data that are one

169
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,539
of our colleagues kindly provided us

170
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:26,139
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a / 16 in somewhere in the Midwest</font>

171
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:29,110
and in this plot he shows the effect of

172
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:32,919
ninja warm attack on his particular / 16

173

analogy maintenance in apt 486 that are

175
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:45,250
attributed to warm scans so we see at

176
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:48,010
the peak and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> at rate per minute</font>

177
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,449
at the peak this chap was receiving

178
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,740
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a seven and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a half</font>

179
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:56,319
thousand

180
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:59,170
one scans per minute in red we show the

181
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,550
total number of unique attackers seen

182
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,060
from the vantage point of this

183
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,579
particular / 16 per minute so there are

184
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,319
moments when this guy was being

185
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,860
simultaneously attacked by something

186
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,270
like 1500 machines and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzed who</font>

187
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,959
they were too and they were coming from

188
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:18,970
all around the globe including actually

189
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,489
the top one was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best one that was a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the third one was at one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,220
very glamorous networking universities

193
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,649
United States so anyway notice this

194
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,660
enormous kind of wave that goes on our

195
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:39,580
period of couple of hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful day the courtesy of</font>

198
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:47,670
one colleague here who<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's prefer to</font>

199
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,830
remain anonymous but this guy was

200
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:54,069
actually monitoring the router cpu

201
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:56,980
utilization on the access route that's a

202
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:00,370
big fear one provider by the way now

203
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">this again the perfect alignment warm</font>

204
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,050
scans what is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and i'll</font>

205
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,079
explain a moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the name de warm</font>

206
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:11,589
goes kaboom ok here we are looking at

207
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:14,160
cpu utilization on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a router this router</font>

208
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:17,829
is big enough so it doesn't come out and

209
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,420
you see the utilization goes up to forty

210
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:22,239
percent from something that's close to

211
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:25,660
ten percent again in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same period of</font>

212
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">time interesting thing there is a couple</font>

213
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:33,130
of other features there are three

214
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:35,620
strange spikes give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> before okay if</font>

215
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,070
you see there are corresponding bumps in

216
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,680
CT utilization our interpretation is

217
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:44,320
that whoever created ninda was

218
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,849
experimenting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> preceding</font>

220
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,980
maybe the warm at the timer and timed

221
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,310
out and did not spread on purpose on the

222

third or on the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass the guys</font>

223
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:02,949
really got it right so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

224
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,170
important plot because this will produce

00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:08,099
a call

all major vendors in a universe sisters

229
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:20,220
and so forth and accepted CP utilization

230

and excessive memory utilization are

231
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,820
going to be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mechanisms that</font>

232
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:29,550
we have tentatively identified so at

<font color="#E5E5E5">this point you see that sending warms to</font>

suffer terribly they are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

now we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and these two things</font>

together again this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of way</font>

come back to this point in a moment at

not nice but it's hardly a consequence

lastly and most importantly a global our

that's exactly why looking at very many

because in a bit sponsored the

far<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be very practical so global</font>

338
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:26,490
instability it's an exponential growth

339
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:29,790
in the rate of announcements and or

340
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:32,670
withdrawals it lasts hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> or days</font>

341
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:35,130
because we think that hours and days is

342
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,229
way beyond the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expected scale of</font>

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:43,260
theoretically and it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show large</font>

345
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,120
diversity and we will focus on that the

346
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,180
fact that a very large<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

347
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,790

348
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,160
should be seen in our peering sessions

349
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,050
with most major Internet service

350

354
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,450
we have covered the ninja you've got the

355
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:11,970
flavor let's go now and see what

356
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,950
happened your encoded version<font color="#E5E5E5"> too I mean</font>

357
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,650
the rationale is obviously when you have

358
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,990
one incident all that you can derive

359
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,210
from it is a philosophical statement

360
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,410
when I have two incidents I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

362
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:30,000

so it kind of goes our daily cycles they

00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:13,559
there's a kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sizeable instability</font>

during the scan phase much more

391
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:51,149
didn't do that much damage because it

392
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:53,149
couldn't scan so well so again we see

393
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:55,379
extremely rapid exponential growth

394
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:56,789
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use a lot of lots of</font>

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:02,460
normally a router say on the input cease

525
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,830
I don't know maybe five thousand flowers

526
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,070
on the average and then out of the blue

527
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,600
it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> two hundred thousand flows or</font>

528
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,580
500,000 flows that would be a big

529
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,270
discontinuity would put a lot of stress

530
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:19,649
on the router now there may be a net

531
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:22,139
problems without that net we know of

532
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:25,140
many documented instances of arc storms

533
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:28,920
caused by scans to non existing machines

534
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,420
and actually this network are one of

okay second our routing traffic itself

that's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing because</font>

enough because it's a lot of it that's

566
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,929
an explanation that we are understood

567
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,169
talking to people<font color="#E5E5E5"> a say on the Nano</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">here but roughly somebody miss considers</font>

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,939
the configuration starts announcing a

00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:16,120
private number but there are routers in

574
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:19,659
the world that ignores us and just

575
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:23,350
propagate these announcements that's not

576
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:25,630
what RFC requires other routers will see

00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,950
people come and say hey you know we

738

don't mind if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see our problems and I</font>

739
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:45,439
see your problems so I think of a kind

00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an onion of groups with different</font>

743
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:58,720

744
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:04,399
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> up concrete data for operators and</font>

745
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:07,830
me listen on your conclusion

746
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,680
you thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sudden increasing</font>

747
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:14,430
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> flows and you thought that</font>

748
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,980
could potentially create instability in

749
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:21,200
browsers and i would like to ask why do

750
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:25,410
you believe so I mean any modern router

751
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,689
does not forward based on flows well

752
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:32,310
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be should be completely relevant</font>

753
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:34,830
only five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten year old bosses should</font>

754
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:38,029
care about the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flows and even</font>

755
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:44,340
and even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should not affect</font>

756
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:46,440
routing as such so why how would the

757
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:50,190
increasing number of laws affect the

758
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:53,520
ability of routing on a router that's

759
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:57,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually good place to the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

760
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:01,020
sure when I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when the number of</font>

761
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:02,760
flows increases dramatically it is not

762
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,009
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing it's about people who</font>

763
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,260
present of the run net flow on the

764
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,060
router and that flow starts using

765
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,300
enormous amount of memory and CPU

766
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,279
resources so it's not routing it's a net

767
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,660
flow facility installed on the router

768
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:21,170
with my understanding still an insult

769
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:24,359
gets out of control and make the router

770
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:27,000
control sleep over and you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

771
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:31,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean this is maybe kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

772
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,710
make that one line of hypothesis

773
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:38,250
followed by a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> app</font>

774
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:41,250
equipment vendors I mean the internals

775
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:43,230
of most routers are proprietary so of

776
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:46,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">course we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infer what happens</font>

777
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:49,020
looking at the data and looking at the

778
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:51,420
troubleshooting guides at various

779
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,990
routers websites which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very detailed</font>

780
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and actually do specified cases such</font>

781
00:37:54,990 --> 00:38:00,959
that when the number of flows increases

782
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:03,120
very rapidly the CPU can get stopped

783
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,650
when city that starts the GP<font color="#E5E5E5"> session</font>

784
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:10,980
stop sending updates so here I literally

785
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:14,760
rely in this claim on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basis of</font>

786
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,260
troubleshooting guys guides available on

00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,410
the website of

788
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:23,910
the major outfit vendors and I have not

789
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:26,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">done those measurements my steps and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

790
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:28,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was killing sleep on coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

791
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,020
what what we did observe and this thing

792
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,569
is completely related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> net flow export</font>

793
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:36,840
and it's not it wasn't what we observed

794
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:39,870
was not cpu-bound but bandwidth down

795
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,970
because those folks who were those folks

796
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:44,339
who were had net flow turned on you know

797
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:46,169
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time they got hit by this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

798
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,750
low bandwidth providers and so what

799
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:51,770
happened was their entire the flow

800
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:55,230
export filled up their entirety wine and

801
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:57,990
obviously that dropped our bgp that's

802
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:02,390
what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you yeah that's a</font>

803
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:05,250
very interesting data and another

804
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:09,029
another question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like to raise</font>

805
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:16,200
is concerning so you're measuring number

806
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:19,950
of withdrawals in terms of bgp when you

807
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:23,520
consider bgp instability um did you try

808
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:27,750
to go into you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know more specifics what</font>

809
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:32,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">does withdraws means because sometimes</font>

810
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:34,710
the fact is the fact of the tingles when

811
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:38,190
a single projects go down it can have

812
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:42,920
many many many withdrawals for the

813
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:46,160
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> press it and unless the rate is</font>

814
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:49,470
extremely excessive that should not

815
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,589
affect your normal functionality I mean

816
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:55,830
do you think that's doing that

817
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:59,430
high-level withdraws good you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>
