of the questions I got most recently was

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,330
this the workflow that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is</font>

163
00:09:52,410 --> 00:10:00,000
on at a groan of the factory

see what we were calling a relatively

it actually has a slight precursor its

point nothing at all I don't know

00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,600
whether this means that the kiddies just

250

70 people decided to install patches we

256
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:19,449
that they occur and recover from the

good the network is at routing around

00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,770
and recovery and I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

being perhaps over-hasty but a little

everything was back to where it was the

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's just put it that way the</font>

294
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:21,688
incredible effective that had on the

295
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,689
transatlantic connection to boston and

296
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:27,510
to the Washington area was really quite

297
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:33,360
something latency literally doubled to

298
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:35,140
boston from tell house in London within

299
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,939
40 minutes

300
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:42,030
and latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> over devil to the what was</font>

301
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:47,650
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unit cop i guess i have to collocate</font>

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:51,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">worldcom pop in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virginia from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amsterdam</font>

303
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:55,270
so the rerouted on the part of all the

304
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:58,540
European<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts etcetera work great but</font>

305
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:01,210
none<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those was designed to carry the</font>

306
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:04,629
incredible increase in traffic what is

307
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,980
done it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we just hadn't</font>

308
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought about we hadn't thought of</font>

309
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,500
timeliness so to speak in terms of just

310
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,830
getting the messages through packet

311
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:19,810
packet loss was really quite trivial

312
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:23,159
after the first effect shock effect it's

313
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,159
just that everything slowed down
