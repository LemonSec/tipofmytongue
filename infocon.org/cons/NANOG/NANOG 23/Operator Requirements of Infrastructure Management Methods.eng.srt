1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:07,710
so many of you probably know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,300
there's an effort that's been going on

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,009
jointly between the network management

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,039
operations area in areas in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IETF to</font>

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,520
try and come back to a kind of

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:24,570
convergence there's been this separation

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,090
over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years where they've</font>

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,198
been excuse me the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network management</font>

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,780
people have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing these great SNMP</font>

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,480
version 3 with cryptographic security

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,920
tools and the operation people

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,089
operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been using</font>

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,910
command line and there are lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons to that and the answer is not to</font>

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,288
retrain all of the operators since the

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,610
operators are doing what they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,020
for reasons the answer is probably to

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,050
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what exactly it is that</font>

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,809
operators need whether command line is

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,550
it whether an enhanced command line of

21
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:08,850
some sort is it whether command line

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:12,869
with some kinds of augmentation and so

23
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,429
forth so we've got this this draft

24
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,520
operator requirements and from

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure management methods which</font>

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,060
is tempting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> catalog what it is</font>

27
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:26,549
that operators are looking for so we're

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,880
basically doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little road show and</font>

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,880
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> around to nanog and apricots and</font>

32
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,899
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback from operators on the</font>

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:47,210
draft so the graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself can of course</font>

34
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,210
we found in the IETF graphs directory

extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> clips day I think we're one going</font>

37
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,320
on to now so I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run through</font>

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,960
the kind of open issues the issues that

39
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,500
seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still kind of hot</font>

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,280
topics that we particularly need input

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,350
on so

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,819
consensus has basically been reached

43
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:21,160
that what we're looking for is a

44
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,739
command-line interface but one that's a

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,390
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more smtp you like alright so</font>

46
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,950
in smtp you have a transaction where

47
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,809
it's on the one hand human

48
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,319
understandable if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and you type it</font>

49
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,360
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand it's very easy to</font>

50
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,920
automate part of the reason it's easy to

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,800
automate is because it's got numeric

52
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,290
result codes and the text of the result

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,030
code is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machines point of view</font>

54
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,079
of comments that it can pass on to user

55
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,540
if it means to but the codes can operate

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,750
completely from numeric return codes at

57
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,359
the beginning so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is do we</font>

58
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,190
all want or routers spitting back little

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,120
numeric result codes at us at the

60
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,319
beginning of things that they say to us

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,530
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think this is that would be</font>

62
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,869
ugly I want pretty ASCII other people

63
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">will say pretty ASCII is ugly I want</font>

64
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:17,680
numbers so there's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> light</font>

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,250
there need input from you guys and we

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,170
can have questions after this of

67
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:27,070
suggestions etc the best way though is

68
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:29,078
to email<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok auto configuration and this</font>

69
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,049
brings up so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a bunch of things</font>

70
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,489
that will touch on the same sort of

71
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,160
little problem area so auto

72
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:39,190
configuration is when you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new</font>

73
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,590
device out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box right just come</font>

74
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the manufacturer you plug it in you</font>

75
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,239
plug it into the network does it try to

76
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,190
do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it try to configure</font>

77
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,590
itself a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit so that you can get</font>

78
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,650
to it remotely or does it sit there

79
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,320
inert until you plug in on the console

80
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,700
port give it a password you know give it

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,680
out the addresses so and so forth the

82
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:07,810
way a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people seem to be</font>

83
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,160
distinguishing yes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I am one</font>

84
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:14,019
of those people so I may be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

85
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:16,120
biased is this is a draft about operator

86
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:19,168
requirements an operator is a

87
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,360
professional configurator of devices

88
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:24,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">configured yes integrator whatever</font>

89
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,290
something someday configures devices for

90
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:29,159
a living

91
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">um things that configure themselves are</font>

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:37,080
by definition not things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

93
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,560
professional configures therefore

94
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,080
they're out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope of this document</font>

95
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:47,750
this is kind of a semantic distinction

96
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:50,400
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> making and that may be a little too</font>

97
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">tricky or goofy or something i'm not</font>

98
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,729
sure but<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the other hand it may be</font>

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,770
useful there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of people who do</font>

100
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,990
big core routers who say you know

101
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,060
anything that this thing does that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

102
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:08,130
didn't tell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is a security</font>

103
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem and it is you know stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

104
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,640
to go in and correct so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

105
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,340
them doing anything now on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

106
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,840
hand there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know cable modems and</font>

107
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,390
stuff like that where they need to be

108
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,609
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come from the manufacturer</font>

109
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,560
directly to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-user be plugged in</font>

110
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,410
and come up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> work without anyone ever</font>

111
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,830
touching them<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so the argument is</font>

112
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,390
maybe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> an operator requirements</font>

113
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,590
graph doesn't need to touch on things

114
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:35,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need to be touched by</font>

115
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:39,890
operators but that's open to argument as

116
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:43,609
well so in the IHF we do our fees and

117
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:46,260
rfcs talk about protocol on the wire

118
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,240
whether something has a serial port<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

119
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,940
what the serial port looks like it's not

120
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,260
protocol on the wire so it's bit of

121
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,840
question as to whether we can get away

122
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,700
with saying in the documents that one of

123
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,549
operators requirements is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

124
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:03,120
everything have a console port a craft

125
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,980
access port and much less whether we can

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,570
get away with saying it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be rj45</font>

127
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,470
with specific pin up so that we only

128
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,610
have to carry one cable and no adapters

129
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,000
nevertheless there seems to be something

130
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,680
that operators feel strongly about so I

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">think where we are on this is that we're</font>

132
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to try to get it in and see if</font>

133
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,349
anybody should sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down this brings up</font>

134
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,320
the same issue of can we write a

135
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:32,010
document in the IETF that says you have

136
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have a certain port on a device and</font>

137
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,750
then do the cable modem guys get uptight

138
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,640
because putting that fork on would cost

139
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,520
dollars on their $25 device that

140
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:47,050
whatever so sort of the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> asherz</font>

141
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:51,070
before and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same issue comes</font>

142
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:54,060
up when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk about HTML forms as a</font>

143
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:56,890
means of configuring a device

144
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,480
professional operators seem to be pretty

145
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,960
much in agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they never want to</font>

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:05,830
see any HTML out of their core router on

147
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:09,099
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand we can't have a lot of</font>

148
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:11,140
sort of cable modem whatever folks who

149
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,930
say well nobody's ever gonna touch this

150
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,370
using a command<font color="#E5E5E5"> line if we're ever going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to get anything out of the user it has</font>

to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero browser so same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing do we</font>

153
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,669
say HTML forms are explicitly not how we

154
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,940
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see our router is configured or</font>

155
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:36,370
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we not address the issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or do we say</font>

156
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:39,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is not how you do a core router all</font>

157
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,680
right one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the one of the main</font>

158
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:46,299
requirements that we have good consensus

159
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,460
on is that you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to export</font>

160
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,830
the complete configuration of a device

161
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,200
in one file that is you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

162
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,880
to get an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASCII text file out of a</font>

163
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,469
device which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can read into another</font>

164
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,990
device and have a clone of the first

165
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:03,250
device or you know back it up for

166
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:06,850
restore it or whatever the question then

167
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:09,430
is private<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys if the device contains a</font>

168
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,800
private key should you be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to export</font>

169
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:17,560
the private key as easily as your

170
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:19,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">exports a interface configuration if you</font>

171
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,370
don't and you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restore</font>

172
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,789
something in an emergency you've got a

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:29,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem if you do you got a security</font>

174
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,729
issue so I am many people I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think can</font>

175
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,890
see both sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that we just need to</font>

176
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,809
have good arguments on each side and

177
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">hammer something out i don't think</font>

178
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,579
there's any animosity in this one I

179
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:45,700
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just everybody's both sides</font>

180
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:49,810
with comment preservation right now you

181
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">can comment a configuration drop it into</font>

182
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,750
a router and many

183
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,870
routers will strip almost every comment

184
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,510
you put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you don't get the</font>

185
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,240
comments back out again vendors getting

186
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:05,040
better and better about that over time

187
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:09,640
but it's still not<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect by any means</font>

188
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,319
operators seem to feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's no</font>

189
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,300
reason that anything they type in should

190
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,710
ever be this car to gratuitously by the

191
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,839
vendor vendors keep coming back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

192
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,400
saying but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kept everything you</font>

193
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:27,430
typed your configurations would be

194
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:29,110
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> long I don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody's</font>

195
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:33,849
figured out quite quite why there's a

196
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:38,650
disagreement on this would change commit

197
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,840
time there's a distinction between<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

198
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,220
by line commit where every time you hit

199
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:46,030
a carriage return is renderings

200
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,820
configuration that last line of

201
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:51,520
configuration immediately is committed

202
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:56,650
to operational status that is it goes

203
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:59,230
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect if your last line was you</font>

204
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,930
know interface the one I'm logging in

205
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,720
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> shutdown then you're not going</font>

206
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:08,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be typing anything on the next slide</font>

207
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,840
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay some people like it that</font>

208
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,760
way other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to type</font>

209
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,870
their entire config including the parts

210
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:19,830
that would allow them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get in on a</font>

211
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:25,360
different interface and then commit so

212
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:29,530
should the device manufacturer determine

213
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,530
which way to do commits based upon which

214
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:36,000
way the user is the operator is entering

215
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:40,060
the data that is if the operator has

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">tftp I a new config into the device do</font>

217
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:46,869
it as a bash if the operator is typing

218
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,840
line by line do it line by line maybe

219
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,080
there's argument on this to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two</font>

220
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,150
camps to people like it different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

221
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,920
vendors like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it different ways it seems</font>

222
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">like maybe everybody's gonna wind up</font>

223
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,740
having to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> both but you know</font>

224
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,930
everybody's a little argument on that

225
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,150
hmm<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they'd commit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> delayed commit</font>

226
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:12,510
means you create a config<font color="#E5E5E5"> snippet that</font>

227
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:17,340
is a few lines of config not a whole

228
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:19,470
configuration which maybe just affect a

229
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:24,710
small part of the router and you say put

230
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:27,870
this into effect at midnight local time

231
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:30,780
the problem with doing this is that this

232
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">is effectively</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the same thing as</font>

233
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,089
allowing multiple users to touch the box

234
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,590
at the same time that is giving

235
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:41,880
simultaneous<font color="#E5E5E5"> right access to multiple</font>

236
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:45,720
parties because if you have a snippet

237
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,310
which goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> into effect in an hour and in</font>

238
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,620
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half hour somebody else comes along</font>

239
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,150
and changes a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out from</font>

240
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,120
under what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were expecting that</font>

241
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:57,090
snippet to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you've essentially</font>

242
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,180
got the overlapping right<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem right</font>

243
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:03,000
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you snip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it obviously is trying</font>

244
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,130
to effect a change based upon one state

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,200
and that state no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer applies when</font>

246
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:14,250
the snippet is committed so in the draft

247
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,140
basically what we say is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

248
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,120
really hairy problem we think you should

249
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,250
think really carefully before you do

250
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,060
anything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this area and then we don't</font>

251
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">give any advice about it that's</font>

252
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically before I met</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that so if</font>

253
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:33,170
anybody has any useful advice to give

254
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,170
defenders on this we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear it</font>

255
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:43,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so then we have the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of last</font>

256
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:47,550
big issue of and do people really need

257
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:50,370
different output for machine parsing

258
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,810
than we need for<font color="#CCCCCC"> human parsing or is</font>

259
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:59,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just habit that people continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

260
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:03,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask for that is it or is this like the</font>

261
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of a date a DA issue where you know</font>

262
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,950
curb cuts are better for everybody not

263
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,600
just folks with wheelchairs and better

264
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,690
lighting is better for everybody not

265
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,720
just people you know we can't see as

266
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,720
well

267
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,959
my theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is that better</font>

268
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,560
designed UI is better for everybody

269
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:27,680
whether they're reading it as a person

270
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,560
or reading it in code there are other

271
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,520
folks who think that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really needs to</font>

272
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,439
be a distinction um if there's a

273
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,470
distinction everybody has agreed that

274
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,350
the branch should be as late as possible

275
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:46,370
so that the two modes don't drift apart

276
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,230
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the smallest possible amount</font>

277
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:54,200
of code needs to be written to generate

278
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:58,220
the output what this may come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is</font>

279
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:03,140
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML style everything on its own</font>

280
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:06,980
line for machine parsing<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus tabular</font>

281
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:11,720
like show IP bgp some style output for

282
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:13,940
visual parsing if that's really the only

283
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,250
difference and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get the same data</font>

284
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,980
either way<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the same data either</font>

285
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:23,230
way and it just comes out taller and

286
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,610
skinnier if you ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it line by line</font>

287
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,380
probably nobody has any objections to

288
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:32,060
that so we're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

289
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:36,980
that represents consensus I think it's

290
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:39,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last one a divergent triple a is if</font>

291
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,800
you've got a command line and you've got

292
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,540
SNMP with right now is that completely

293
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,439
different authentication and

294
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,089
authorization modes for those right that

295
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,050
may be hitting completely different

296
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:58,430
triple-a<font color="#E5E5E5"> backends you know may have</font>

297
00:14:54,050 --> 00:15:02,170
different concepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what a user is is</font>

298
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:08,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay most people don't like that</font>

299
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:15,260
but SNMP is is here nobody's suggesting

300
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:17,570
that we get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it there's no obvious</font>

301
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,339
solution to this either other than

302
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:22,940
things that idea going forward and

303
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:26,000
nobody should create any new modes the

304
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,070
SNMP folks are interested as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Burt</font>

305
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,590
is

306
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,180
pushing on them to try to sort of come

307
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,070
into line with the same authentication

308
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,620
modes that people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> staying to use on</font>

309
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:42,410
on routers for remote authentication

310
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:43,910
authorization so forth obviously if you

311
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,670
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help the first thing you need to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">feldman mine are the relevant contacts</font>

315
00:15:53,780 --> 00:16:02,449
on this area directors of course are

Burt women and Randy bush so that is it

317

the North management size would probably

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,829
stand up and say you can do a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

things that you'd be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing</font>

322
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,000
with the command line interface or GUI

323
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:28,850
or whatever you want by having the SNMP

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,340
underlying layers say exactly how they

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,710
are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm curious what your response</font>

to that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things we seem to</font>

have reached<font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus on is that SNMP</font>

328

00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:49,010
in the IETF with consensus among the

parties involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a time and that</font>

332
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:55,550
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to even think about</font>

333
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,500
discarding that that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

334
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:00,530
way to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

335
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:03,530
a mid browser goes into the router

336
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:05,449
itself so that from the command line on

337
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:14,000
the serial<font color="#CCCCCC"> port of the router you can</font>

338
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:15,410
get at me<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question ok I</font>

340
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,060
talking about it is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a user</font>

instrumentation that you want and and

344
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,049
perform actions on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router through</font>

SNMP

346
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:31,730
and so forth that really attracted more

347
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,710
about the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a middleware piece</font>

348
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,269
that would be more the way that the

349
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,070
operators think more the way the

350
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:40,220
operators do their daily configurations

351
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiplications and such yeah that's</font>

352
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,610
certainly that's certainly one way of

353
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,960
putting it that I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

354
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:50,149
would agree with to make it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

355
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,940
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exception of things like we do</font>

356
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:58,070
need a serial port no one is trying to

357
00:17:52,940 --> 00:18:01,460
dictate how devices should work all

358
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:04,908
we're trying to do is make<font color="#E5E5E5"> uniform how</font>

359
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,730
operators interoperate with the devices

360
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:09,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying the internals</font>

361
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the device should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be tough and such</font>

362
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:15,049
all we're saying is when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to type</font>

363
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:18,529
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device we want it to recognize</font>

364
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:24,139
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> commands whether it's a Cisco</font>

365
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:27,859
or juniper or some little bit ESET we

366
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:30,678
want it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fit back the answer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

367
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:33,019
question show interface ethernet<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 or</font>

368
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,230
whatever in the same format regardless

369
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:38,809
what vendor it is when vendors have

370
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:40,840
vendor specific features that are the

371
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:42,889
unique values that vendor provides

372
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,359
obviously that can't be made uniform

373
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:46,850
with somebody who doesn't have that

374
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:49,220
feature and nobody's trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dictate</font>

375
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,279
that right all we're saying is that

376
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,379
where there is an ambiguous feature

377
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:57,169
overlap we want it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work the same and</font>

378
00:18:54,379 --> 00:19:01,969
we want to work in this kind of simple

379
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:03,799
CLI yeah yes I had two<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions Michael</font>

380
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,600
Hayden<font color="#CCCCCC"> riverstone when you say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

381
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,908
can copy a config off the boxes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

382
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,109
take it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on other box what</font>

383
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,999
kind of assumptions you're making there

384
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:12,769
because as far as I know when you try to

385
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:15,169
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if those boxes aren't the same</font>

386
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:17,509
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> or possibly running even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

387
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:19,340
firmware does it work and the second

388
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:20,600
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if we're going to have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> co</font>

389
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,109
life do you think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

390
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:27,379
standardized should there be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a form</font>

391
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:29,720
that's generic or do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's good</font>

392
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:31,549
it's good to you develop Sea lies the

393
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,310
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> styles and just figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

394
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:35,070

398
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:48,240
dictate to vendors what they should do

399
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:50,880
in the event that they well obviously if

400
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,350
we get error back because we tried to

401
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,100
address an interface that doesn't exist

402
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,750
on that box we want the error to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

411
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,450
guys like where they have a context of

copying the configs in a bit had none

417
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:33,919
thing um one thing that has been

418
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussed is the question of whether the</font>

00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,150
naming the interface type as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as its</font>

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,550
position within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box is gratuitous or</font>

421
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:46,890
not that is should an interface the

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:50,100
interface 1 / 0 / 2 dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 or whatever or</font>

423
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:56,970
should it be interface ethernet 150 /

427
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:12,960
folks seem to be leaning towards making

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:15,420
that input optional output probably

429
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,490
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it in the output with will</font>

430
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,520
assume than you like the command to find

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,080
anything strange food yes when you hide

432
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,270
it well as well use that to write your

show and even Canadians<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes there's a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of stuff in here about ranges and</font>

435
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,940
lists and templates and settable

436
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,520
defaults and so forth it to answer your

437
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,900
question probably the part of the

438
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,629
document you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

439
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:43,590
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> about settable defaults where you</font>

440
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,400
say for any new board of type through

441
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,100
interface

442
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,000
food it goes in here's what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

443
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:57,629
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of the rest is what</font>

444
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,540
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about question 2 was late</font>

445
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:05,010
sorry do quests or two ago simply is

446
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:06,570
there a standard format representing the

447
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,910
information such that maybe you know

448
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,189
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a either a form or an ietf</font>

449
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,510
effort to say here's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like what</font>

450
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,520
the features are one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

451
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:17,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">I went into a lot with great not</font>

452
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,830
features representation yes thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

453
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:23,159
friend I was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eye dr important</font>

454
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:25,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feeding the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last 80s and some got</font>

455
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,390
up to present<font color="#CCCCCC"> them in jeff hassan</font>

456
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,520
actually and a lot of the guys walked

457
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,200
out of the room to<font color="#CCCCCC"> eat food that's yes</font>

458
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,650
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what silly i just want to</font>

459
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">remind the community that a management</font>

460
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,340
plane just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find the objects that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

461
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,900
tweet not necessarily the representation

462
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">of how a vendor is going to is provided</font>

463
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,460
and who'd be nice of course if the

464
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,620
vendors will do what the standard says

465
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,500
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's remains an issue</font>

466
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:52,199
where things seem to be going is that

467
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:56,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">there needs to be pressure upon vendors</font>

468
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,740
to make the UI representation uniform

469
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">whereas they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have overlap but</font>

470
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,510
there should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be no pressure at all upon</font>

471
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,910
them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> create overlap right we're not</font>

472
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:09,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for vendors to be more uniform</font>

473
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:11,610
in what they do we're only<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font>

474
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to represent it in uniform way</font>

475
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:19,979
where there is in fact identical

476
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:22,919
functionality yes sir back Jeff accents

477
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,440
from Cooper Union University I think

478
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,150
most of the things in this document darn

479
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,650
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and most of them can be</font>

480
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,930
implemented in software which is good

481
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,550
news because you have a chance of the

482
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,560
vendors actually complying with the

483
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,810
standard the only thing I find

484
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:41,310
objectionable a little curious what's

485
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:44,190
the obsession with using an<font color="#E5E5E5"> rj45 as a</font>

486
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:47,940
serial pin out and and trying to dictate

487
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,620
a standard when there have been well how

488
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,290
many permutations of adar they're

489
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,570
already out there as

490
00:23:52,290 --> 00:24:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">anders pre-existing what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with</font>

491
00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:01,530
say a db9 it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive it beds</font>

492
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,010
barrel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's already on a lot of</font>

493
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:07,800
devices so many fewer is and on well I

494
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:11,940
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I mean do I bring it up on</font>

495
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:15,240
the list take<font color="#E5E5E5"> another vote I mean there</font>

496
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:19,680
seems to be consensus sorry there seems

497
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:22,260
to be very rough consensus that if we

498
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:26,220
require<font color="#CCCCCC"> a serial port</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it be the</font>

499
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:29,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">same as what Cisco and some do because</font>

500
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,730
that's at least two vendors who have the

501
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:35,610
same pin outs and so forth obviously the

502
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:39,990
db9 stuff is already<font color="#CCCCCC"> uniformed the</font>

503
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:42,360
problem is that db9 interfaces are a lot

504
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:47,700
more fragile and a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive</font>

505
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:49,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">and bulkier and if we want if we are</font>

506
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,570
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and require anything of</font>

507
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:56,970
vendors we want the requirement to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be as</font>

508
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:59,669
lightweight as possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay any other</font>

509
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:05,720
questions on this one or shall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go</font>

510
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:05,720
ahead to the next talk okay
