<font color="#E5E5E5">okay my name is West heart occur I work</font>

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,599
for nai labs and we've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> started a</font>

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,280
contract under DARPA to design<font color="#E5E5E5"> the test</font>

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,660
bed for evaluating d desk related

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,160
technologies and explicitly what this

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,720
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we want to build a test</font>

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,240
environment that really will emulate the

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,310
real world and as I go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk</font>

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,549
will describe why why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,680
needed quick overview I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,140
today's world how the Internet at large

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,600
looks today and how the research world

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,969
and the startup deed of technologies

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,000
world looks today i'll talk about our

15
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,860
study our goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> flight exists and what</font>

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,200
what problems we hope to solve with it

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's goals are I'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,379
we're actually going about designing

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,120
this network specifically we're

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,399
collecting information from an awful lot

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people and an awful lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of expertise</font>

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,050
areas and really this introduction I

23
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,349
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use with an introduction</font>

24
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boss that we're holding tonight</font>

25
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,250
the details i'm going to go over today

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,439
are very light in nature they're not the

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,790
the in-depth technical details and we

28
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have network diagrams in the</font>

29
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,150
15-minute presentation but we will

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,770
tonight so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in and</font>

31
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,659
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about today please come</font>

32
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,449
to the boss and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stands and microphone</font>

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,320
drink a few beers first so you are more

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,060
willing to get up in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

36
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be great and finally I'll</font>

37
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:29,189
entertain any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions at the end of it</font>

38
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:31,049
oh that's hard to see isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this is</font>

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:37,200
this is a picture produced in 1999's I

<font color="#E5E5E5">that map is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a scale you would be</font>

anybody's been on the recipient end of

61
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,030
the POS attack and what makes it it's

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,099
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this is</font>

63
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,099
the networking between you and them is

64
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:33,380
extremely complex in nature this is what

65
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:35,238
makes des research and deed<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,209
there's only found one unfortunately if

70
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,680
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at most research organizations</font>

71
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,730
and you look at most vendors that are

72
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,410
supplying<font color="#CCCCCC"> dds related technologies they</font>

73
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,390
have very very very small networks in

74
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,590
order to test things on and it turns out

75
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,200
that the operators of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't like running feed us tests over</font>

77
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,190
the real networks anywhere they<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to</font>

78
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,299
frown upon that especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you tell</font>

79
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,030
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to leave it running for a</font>

80
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:10,430
week to really test your tool so they

81
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,319
build smaller networks usually composed

82
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,930
of a few number of posts that are doing

83
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,910
the attacking connected to a small

84
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,790
network in between usually consisting of

85
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:23,120
a single box or a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of boxes and</font>

86
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">you being the target is a single post or</font>

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,870
sometimes a small number of posts and

88
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,400
obviously the scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what actually</font>

89
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens in the research or the vendor</font>

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,019
world is does very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large</font>

91
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,430
corporations have more money to spend on

92
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,859
it and that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

93
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,269
discrepancy comes in in the real world

94
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,650
we of it you know nobody is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

95
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,940
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reproduce the internet to run</font>

96
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,829
tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to happen</font>

97
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,079
nor thing getting on what you run tests

98
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:51,109
on the real internet so the only option

99
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,489
is to create small test labs and the

100
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,250
problem is is that in order to build

101
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:58,670
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really proves that your</font>

102
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,040
new tool is scalable you have to spend

103
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,559
an inordinate<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of money and no one</font>

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,420
organization has that but that much fun

105
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just throw out their test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and</font>

106
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,540
I've talked to some people with some

107
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,738
fairly large ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there are some</font>

108
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,480
adequate ones out there but they're

109
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,139
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> in proprietary locations that</font>

110
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,389
not the general public<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make use of</font>

111
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:19,039
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we come into play we</font>

112
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:20,539
want to be somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the middle we're</font>

113
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:23,060
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to reproduce the internet but</font>

114
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:26,870
we hope to beat every test lab that's

115
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,099
out there one point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a make is with</font>

116
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,909
a lot of the test labs that are out

117
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:30,979
there we're designed for a different

118
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:34,490
purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so we're designing our test</font>

119
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:36,979
lab to specifically help adidas related

120
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,050
research and new technologies being

121
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,120
developed by vendors a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

122
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,280
test labs that are other are built to

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> test routing and to test other types</font>

124
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,190
of problems in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the union's network world</font>

125
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,770
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope to get you know further up</font>

126
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,659
the tree and explicitly we want multiple

127
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,640
research organizations and multiple

128
00:04:53,659 --> 00:05:00,770
vendors and to be accused<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

129
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,719
facility so really briefly the purpose

130
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,909
of our study<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to identify requirements</font>

131
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,500
that are needed in order to build this

132
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:08,719
specialized facility for testing

133
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,979
advanced<font color="#CCCCCC"> to-dos technologies what what</font>

134
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:12,950
are the minimal requirements that needs

135
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:14,630
to build this and such that if vendors

136
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,210
were coming to come in and test their

137
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,530
products that you know we could give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

138
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,719
they could advertise that in their

139
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,159
pamphlets and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

140
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:23,510
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really did test to see if it was</font>

141
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:27,200
scale to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> levels that they want to</font>

142
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:30,020
deploy it up so the design

143
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,370
specifications and then again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

144
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go over these much more details</font>

145
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,800
tonight so come to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> boss if you want</font>

146
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,050
to see the details and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> holes in it</font>

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,750
would be great<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we have possible</font>

148
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,400
network topologies so what what does it

149
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,370
take in order to emulate the real world

150
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,750
such that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can build a a very large</font>

151
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,030
network infrastructure that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

152
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:54,080
for testing that will properly emulate

153
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,400
the real world equipment needs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously those who are kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of tied</font>

155
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,450
together what equipment does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it take to</font>

156
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">make up that technology we want to talk</font>

157
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,630
about connectivity to the real internet

158
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,180
and obviously this is a hard issue to

159
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,550
deal with you don't want to deploy

160
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,780
another huge network of attack posts and

161
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,789
connected directly to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

162
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,409
there's got to be some level of security

163
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,450
between what we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> build and</font>

164
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:16,219
the real internet at the same time will

165
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,659
certainly want to make use of what the

166
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:22,010
Internet has to offer you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

167
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:24,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">transfer live capture dumps into it that</font>

168
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,430
should be possible staffing an

169
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:30,549
administration<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is sort of one of</font>

170
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:32,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">our other sub goals so some of the other</font>

171
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,979
goals are not just to define the

172
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,870
topology but how is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it going to be used</font>

173
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:38,450
obviously you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> define the topology</font>

174
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,440
without actually deciding how to make

175
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,420
use of it how's it

176
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,969
how do the participants that are going

177
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the facility make use of it</font>

178
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,440
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so and so you have to</font>

179
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">decide how you're going to generate</font>

180
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,660
attack traffic obviously you can use

181
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,610
real details tools you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

182
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,170
generation tools there are some some

183
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:01,610
things that provide things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that generate</font>

184
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:03,500
packets that that can do so at a faster

185
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,090
rate than those computers and you can do

186
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,770
capturing replay of real traffic so you

187
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,109
can take traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here now bring in</font>

188
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,930
and hopefully replay it and see if your

189
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">video stool actually sort of lived up to</font>

190
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,430
the real world attack those are actually

191
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,930
very hard problems to solve especially

192
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,900
the last one capture and replay of real

193
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:23,240
traffic that's not a trivial problem

194
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,789
defense mythology obviously you know

195
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,130
different types of dds related defense

196
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,420
technologies offering different ways

197
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,430
because they are placed at different

198
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,780
points in the network so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

199
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about all the places where</font>

200
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,530
physical attachment might occur it might

201
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,870
be near the target it might be near the

202
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,840
sources it might need in the ISP layers

203
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,720
in between some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them will run</font>

204
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,450
directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto end posts so the software</font>

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,120
hosting requirements need to be divided

206
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,950
up as well you need to do people need to

207
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to attach to Cisco boxes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so they</font>

208
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,250
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to attach to you know</font>

209
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,070
specific types of operating systems

210
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:02,780
running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC type of platforms those</font>

211
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:05,840
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems we expect the number</font>

212
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:08,440
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users to be very large obviously</font>

213
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,729
government organizations that this is

214
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,410
initially put in place by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government</font>

215
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we hope the government organizations</font>

216
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,590
like DARPA and their advanced research

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,080
technologies will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make heavy</font>

218
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,960
use of this but research organizations

219
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,760
like universities and another global

220
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,609
collaboration kind of facility should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

221
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,630
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make use of the vendors</font>

222
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,820
obviously should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to test their</font>

223
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,800
products and maybe even do<font color="#CCCCCC"> bake-offs</font>

224
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,870
with other vendors in order to deceive

225
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,849
who did the best which<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones really</font>

226
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,630
working which<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones scale for this large</font>

227
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:40,460
level large ISPs may want to make use of

228
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,830
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to test technologies that</font>

229
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,360
they're planning on deploying large ISPs

230
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,040
generally don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to just take a box</font>

231
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">off the shelf plug and plug in and hope</font>

232
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,079
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> disrupt their own network</font>

233
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,190
potential target sites might even want

234
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,780
to make use of it if they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

235
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,850
deploy something so this is a bientot

236
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,650
suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> vix futures in the middle same</font>

237
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,380
sort of situation they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test new</font>

238
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,790
technology and you everybody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

239
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,589
room might want to end up making use of

240
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,750
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> network in is it's our hope that</font>

241
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,430
and we we cannot say definitively that

242
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,320
DARPA is going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> this direction that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">is our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks that everybody should be</font>

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:20,329
hopefully somebody will build so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

talk to you so since none of us are we

obviously have to go seek out we have a

259

whether it's because they're producing

organizations research organizations and
