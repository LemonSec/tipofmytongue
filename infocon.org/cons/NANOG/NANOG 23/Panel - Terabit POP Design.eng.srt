1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,338
so the panel that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,440
this afternoon is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be on terabit</font>

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,960
pop design or basically next gen pop

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,059
design and we have three folks that

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,370
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have present</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn Duran</font>

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,350
chief technical advisor for ebone<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ted</font>

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sealy senior network architect from</font>

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,910
sprint and Rhonda Silva senior network

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,130
architect from a while Time Warner and I

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,910
think one way to conduct this or the way

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're going to tuck it this</font>

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,000
afternoon is that these guys will each

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,460
present and then we'll hold off

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:57,059
questions at the end and have a full

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:01:01,019
discussion then so Ted all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

16
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,430
things I want to say first I got to be

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,379
careful two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to say first</font>

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,500
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hungover selling in here real</font>

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,780
fast probably and<font color="#CCCCCC"> peter lawford</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:16,439
nothing to do with the ds3 there Peter I

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:18,030
told you I<font color="#CCCCCC"> get even so um so obvious</font>

22
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,979
things real fast the space and power

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,180
issues that we all go through when we go

24
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,960
through these giant migrations we're

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,430
talking about here big box better or is

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,048
a little box better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to clearly</font>

27
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,610
state that we're not advocating either

28
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,130
one right now because we don't know what

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,320
to do yet how do you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all work</font>

30
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,939
together with your physical structure

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,829
your logical infrastructure and the

32
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,020
future what how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this going</font>

33
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,639
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the support systems because</font>

34
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,710
they're real important as we move

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,840
forward into this next iteration of the

36
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,250
internet and what's it all add up to

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,049
after that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so the first thing if your</font>

38
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,189
sprint and you're like us you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

39
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,840
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about stuff like this</font>

40
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,719
about a year out year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half out</font>

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,600
just from a planning perspective when

42
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have eight backfill and routers and</font>

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,719
some of your nodes and you want to

44
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,500
migrate all this is something new

45
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,299
whether it's one big box or little boxes

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,770
it's not an easy migration process and

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,080
you have to think it through clearly and

48
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,960
you got a plan way in advance for it

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:21,240
so like the slide says migrating that's

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,680
not an easy task so we have two things

51
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,210
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at here the width of the big</font>

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,940
box approach with a little box approach

53
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,400
not a lot of this is rocket science it

54
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,140
kind of spells itself out pretty clearly

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,300
you've got you know advantages and

56
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,369
disadvantages to both you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

57
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,870
the big box of give you less elements in

58
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">your network to manage which will give</font>

59
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,330
you less elements your IBS you can match

60
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,710
which makes things better or<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposedly</font>

61
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,050
hopefully you can add things piecemeal

62
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,820
over time and hopefully things don't

63
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,250
consume packet facing interfaces for

64
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,140
interconnection so then there's the

65
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,459
drawbacks there so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had one big</font>

66
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,160
boxing up breaks here really really

67
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,140
screwed physical infrastructure

68
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,750
requirements I reiterate<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you know</font>

69
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,399
space of power such a big premium and

70
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,470
you might even have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand existing</font>

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,030
facilities if you're a big pop or a big

72
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,420
carrier and you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited space in</font>

73
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,550
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> class so the other thing that is</font>

74
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,440
your future<font color="#CCCCCC"> purchase up front and the</font>

75
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,880
risk associated with that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,500
whether the software systems out there

77
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,810
today are designed to do the stuff they

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,820
want them to do for two reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

79
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,850
exist good yes they speak in the

80
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,260
microphone they don't exist<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

81
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,670
we don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the software systems</font>

82
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,540
out there today are capable of doing

83
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,518
this therefore you have a huge risk so

84
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,690
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big box approach and then</font>

85
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,450
there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other box approach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

86
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,620
little box or boxes as we call them so

87
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,320
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably going</font>

88
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,640
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be available sooner rather than later</font>

89
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,989
we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we go this down this</font>

90
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,119
approach will never get all of our

91
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,300
interfaces on one box it's just

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">something we'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it's probably</font>

93
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">a core own solution which means you now</font>

94
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,660
have your still have aggregation boxes

95
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,070
downstream of these guys but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

96
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,799
some benefits here we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already is</font>

97
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,200
doing this this is business as usual

98
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,900
there's much much reduced exposure in a

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,429
failure situation we probably can add

100
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,930
units<font color="#E5E5E5"> peace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know but it means now we're</font>

101
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,910
eating<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customer facing interfaces</font>

102
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,170
probably but then there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ulcer</font>

103
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,950
chance that it might not happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way</font>

104
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,809
odds are it will it's a risk reduction

105
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,190
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a cost issue this</font>

106
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,168
might be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost-effective for us to</font>

107
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,089
do in the short term<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's the</font>

108
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:23,479
fraud back there this is introducing the

109
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">mess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is business as usual</font>

110
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,180
probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consume packet</font>

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,420
interfaces again and if you're a

112
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,310
character like me that's that's the fun

113
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,720
and then it's the scaling thing this is

114
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,180
not buying this anything in the long run

115
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,240
and we'd like to change that we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

116
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more time in the network for</font>

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,800
our boxes in the core in the three years

118
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,830
would get today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of</font>

119
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,300
pushing it actually um so we have to

120
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,810
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this mess work together we've</font>

121
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,550
got 192 and 48 customer-facing boxes

122
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,130
we've got one nineteen forty eight boxes

123
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,260
in the core in the land we've got DPT or

124
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,700
srp in the pop we've got all these

125
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,830
physical interfaces that we have to

126
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">support as well going forward which</font>

127
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:06,729
doesn't simplify matters because it also

128
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of some of them kind of limiting so</font>

129
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,880
then you've also got a look at the large

130
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,990
scale the whole network and you have you

131
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,909
know this isn't going to go into every

132
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,370
pop certain possibly more<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boston</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> others</font>

133
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,420
and then there's the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality that</font>

134
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,400
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take an awful long time to</font>

135
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,780
do this it can't be customer impacting

136
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,330
you got to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> your time so you're</font>

137
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,219
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'd really say on us</font>

138
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:29,090
a year to migrate to anything of the

139
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,670
size and scale next left so you got to

140
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all work together some more you</font>

141
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,000
only want your core boxes in the mesh

142
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,289
obviously you only want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know your</font>

143
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,130
customer boxes are our favorite clients

144
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,800
always you know there's nothing

145
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">earth-shattering here the issue was</font>

146
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,340
growing the network going forward after

147
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,750
you started down this path you know and

148
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,440
this actually ties in of economic

149
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,000
drivers I would tell my account manager

150
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,740
over and over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next time I have to</font>

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,120
buy more cars to go through an upgrade

152
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,260
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade a switch fabric I'm going</font>

153
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,580
to shoot them you know we're tired of

154
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,260
doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure most of the people</font>

155
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,789
than the gloom are as well you know

156
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,050
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I add a box I don't want to</font>

157
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:06,710
buy five cards the pigeon holing up

158
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:08,390
boxing with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network all right I'll</font>

159
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,650
speak wearing the mike thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

160
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:17,320
loud<font color="#E5E5E5"> noon inflation that might hurt</font>

161
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:24,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">people here she all right probably</font>

162
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:27,170
that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus B so uh that's what I</font>

163
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,210
said the thing here is once you go down

164
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,920
this path and you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this leap of</font>

165
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,659
faith you want to be able to upgrade

166
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,310
these things seamlessly and effortlessly

167
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,380
and you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have to take cards</font>

168
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,129
out move cards around jockey things

169
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,839
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

170
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:40,249
because these are just painful

171
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,779
evolutions and especially where you're

172
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,699
going with you know four or five six

173
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:44,869
riders it's hot you know unless a lot of

174
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,429
the people in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room who have those</font>

175
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:48,259
no sighs networks know exactly what I'm

176
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:52,339
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and understand what</font>

177
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,839
happens when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes wrong um so moving</font>

178
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:55,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">on you know there's the other big thing</font>

179
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,469
the support side of this thing you know

180
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,849
I call it the three issues it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font>

181
00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:00,139
be simple it's got to be something to

182
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:02,029
knock control support when you're done

183
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,830
it's got to be saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't meet</font>

184
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,209
people who are a PhD<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand how</font>

185
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,188
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network routes when you're done and</font>

186
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:08,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'm</font>

187
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks you know if it takes you</font>

188
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:12,769
12 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it you're dead your</font>

189
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,909
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave you before long so</font>

190
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:15,319
then you got this other thing if

191
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:16,909
upgrading<font color="#CCCCCC"> it means that you're wearing</font>

192
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,709
two separate networks at the same time

193
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:20,269
you just can't afford<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it because</font>

194
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:22,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> afford</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to operate two networks</font>

195
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:24,559
at once so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

196
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that go into this mix that you have to</font>

197
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:29,659
you know when you decide how you're

198
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:32,990
going to do this going forward and so

199
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:34,159
what is it all add up to so to me it

200
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,439
means you're approachable whole thing's

201
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:38,449
the network as a system and it's just

202
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,459
not about pops and terabits it's about

203
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the support that cost the routing the</font>

204
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,300
physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements the deployment</font>

205
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,009
requirements the economic drivers you

206
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,149
know each of the elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> is above you</font>

207
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,429
know you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to be able to justify</font>

208
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,979
the move in this direction which then

209
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:53,119
you know you ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself to this what's</font>

210
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:55,849
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on out there in the world</font>

211
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:57,589
today you know is the model that we

212
00:07:55,849 --> 00:08:00,498
<font color="#E5E5E5">pursue the best way to do things and</font>

213
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,849
sometimes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know so didn't ask</font>

214
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:04,099
yourself is it easier to disperse<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

215
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:07,188
network and I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I doubt it but some</font>

216
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:11,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases it might make sense so I can hear</font>

217
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:13,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">the volume coming up so again you add it</font>

218
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:14,779
all up you've got everybody in the

219
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:16,849
brother in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this business saying the same</font>

220
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:18,529
thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've all got zero packet</font>

221
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,878
loss or latency backbones you know these

222
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:21,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">are all becoming the status quo right</font>

223
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,939
well if you read everybody's material

224
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,529
and marketing that's what they say right

225
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:29,629
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> competition continues to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

226
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:32,208
fiercer and the price points lower and

227
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:34,310
lower we all know that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition</font>

228
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,958
margins are shrinking so then does it

229
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:37,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these big big box</font>

230
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,919
deployments in the core your network and

231
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,389
continue to back haul stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd say no</font>

232
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,588
the screen up this backhaul stuff sucks

233
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:45,500
it cost you a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money in the long</font>

234
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,880
run so the bottom line and all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> mix</font>

235
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,949
this has got to be profitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

236
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,189
money you know you might have a mix of

237
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:51,510
big boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and certain pop</font>

238
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,340
where you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the balance requirements</font>

239
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have smaller boxes where you</font>

240
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,760
want to push out to the edge to get to

241
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,260
the customer but then this brings in

242
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,700
this other thing this access issue we

243
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,650
have today where you know high-speed

244
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,550
access and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local loop ism it's still</font>

245
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:09,600
not there so more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this what are we</font>

246
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,640
back to then we just continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font>

247
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,260
the network the same way the the

248
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical topology may change a little</font>

249
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,010
bit you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the switch fabric might</font>

250
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,800
change a little bit of whatever box

251
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,630
you're using but the interfaces are the

252
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,010
same all the vendors using the same

253
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,910
chipsets you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that's</font>

254
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,730
different is their internal box

255
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,350
architecture this is never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

256
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,000
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal is to move lots and lots</font>

257
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,200
of packets in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core and you know you</font>

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,880
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push the intelligence further</font>

259
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,070
and further out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge now this is</font>

260
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,300
exactly what we do today you know the

261
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,560
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that's different is you got</font>

262
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,000
to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to do it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

263
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,469
all this stuff work together and still

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,280
make a buck it's what it all comes down

265
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:46,830
to so uh you know history tenant history

266
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,560
tends to repeat itself right and you

267
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like the TDM networks a</font>

268
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,800
15-20 years ago they're deployed except

269
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">now we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing with packets and the big</font>

270
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,680
difference there is is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software you</font>

271
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">know today we need the same software</font>

272
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,160
stability they have in their networks

273
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,960
but we don't have today in ours and

274
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,300
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the vendors</font>

275
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,050
work on and that's kind of for this guy

276
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,750
right here so that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to say</font>

277
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:12,359
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more slide for Peter Peter I on is</font>

278
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,570
dead stop making fun of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font>

279
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font>

280
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:26,819
you're welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> Plus news now push the</font>

281
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue all right</font>

282
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,860
really

283
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:16,280
okay how's the volume good this is what

284
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:20,000
we do today and real-live honest-to-god

285
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:23,650
networks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real world we have this</font>

286
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,860

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,510
focused on all the networking gobbly

712
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,309
gook that goes around the many servers

713
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,190
that we host and then the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> half</font>

714
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:49,899
which is focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what's very similar</font>

715
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens in isp it's a wide area</font>

716
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:55,450
network and that's what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

717
00:29:52,090 --> 00:30:00,490
talk it up here so what did it come from

718
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:02,380
um we we started with primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> two main</font>

719
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,470
data centers in Northern Virginia and in

720
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,660
those data centers we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> observe that a</font>

721
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,520
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our subscribers were sucking a</font>

722
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,179
whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> content from a lot of other</font>

723
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,340
people's networks um so we we were

724
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:17,020
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in trying to make that better</font>

725
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,240
trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the performance when</font>

726
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,260
deterministic and decreasing packet loss

727
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this kind of thing so we</font>

728
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,700
developed what's known as the Terra pop

729
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:28,960
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chair prop basically looked like</font>

730
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,270
this a couple of core routers here and

731
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,090
they had connections to a lot of other

732
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,950
routers that either had tracked pairings

733
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:39,240
with or where the pairings were directly

734
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:42,820
attached down here into the core routers

735
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,090
this evolved oops we going wrong way

736
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,090
sorry

737
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:51,409
it's a web caching we realized that we

738
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:54,889
were paying a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money for transit</font>

739
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:57,769
at that time and decided we wanted to

740
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:59,389
lower our transit costs or so we've

741
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:01,159
developed caching infrastructures within

742
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:02,629
the data centers the next logical step

743
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,450
from there was for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the web</font>

744
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:08,238
caches closer to a subscriber base which

745
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:10,309
led to a I keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on way here which</font>

746
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:13,639
led to an extension of the chair pop

747
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:18,320
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Howie tdn was born here's sort</font>

additional pops in Europe in Japan and

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,359
in Brazil and increased that capacity

<font color="#CCCCCC">sooner c12 backbone interconnecting all</font>

764
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:07,669

data centers with the web cache

766
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:11,690

without all the extra lines on it and

771
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:26,330
this is what we're currently working on

772
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:29,869
as when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see 1982 back then um well</font>

Northern Virginia and also in the bay

775
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:38,419
area here we realized that we could

776
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:40,340
deploy a metro 70m infrastructure to

777

reduce our costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the multiple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or 248</font>

about our infrastructure there's a pop

782
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:52,549
architecture what are these pops look

783
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:55,489
like as we went through these various

784
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:57,670
stages and as we continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> grow here's</font>

785
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:58,810
a physical layout<font color="#E5E5E5"> interacts</font>

Hunter routers and all the stuff that

787
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,840
supports them it's not too interesting

788
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,950
here's what it originally looked like

789
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the two routers on the top labeled</font>

00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:11,430
bb1 db2 these are what we call our back

791
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:13,360
burner outers and initially they had

792
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,190
multiple of Cee three links that would

793
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,350
go out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other until</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they pop</font>

794
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:20,980
locations and the wear them were

795
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:22,209
attached additional routers and color

796
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,650
pop routers and this is where all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

797
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,360
external interconnects would come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

798
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:28,750
sir data centers would attach here our

799
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,139
peers attached here our remote offices

800
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,220
attached here and then we had a

801
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,530
basically a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mashed infrastructure in</font>

802
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,150
between there this extra pop router off

803
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:38,500
to the side<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is what we call low</font>

804
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,210
speed rather we typically have one in

805
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:46,990
each of our pops where we terminate

806
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:49,600
things that are sub 0 c 3 so this

807
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:53,620
evolves as our bandwidth requirements

808
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:56,800
increased we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to OC 12 backbone and</font>

809
00:33:53,620 --> 00:34:00,760
multiple c12 interconnects and then this

810
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:03,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly oops wrong way sorry went to OC</font>

811
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,670
4800 next when we got a 248 line cards

812
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:08,889
available to us more bandwidth

813
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,990
availability seems always precipitate

814
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:15,819
more bandwidth consumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> thus we had</font>

815
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:18,100
an mp40 avec deployed with mobile OC 48

817
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,199
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing today Oh</font>

818
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,080

819
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:30,790
backbone connections what's easily

820
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,179
expected on the horizon for us is this

821
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:38,980
will go to multiple OC one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tues for</font>

822
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:41,918
the intro pop which will lead to when

it's available<font color="#E5E5E5"> by C 768 for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> intro</font>

824
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,850
pop connectivity and of course that's

825
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:50,319
always going to lead to the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

826
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:52,060
you see the pattern of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a grinder not</font>

827
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,270
sure if you know where is this going to

828
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:57,220
go we've got OC 768 background

829

832
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,250
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow but will be will be</font>

833

835
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:16,530

00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:18,900
slide um then with the bottom bottom

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only show three routers typically</font>

um here's some additional steps i'm

844
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,850
going to hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of these when they</font>

853
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:12,540
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> um some component statistics here</font>

942
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:11,480
before which is that the figure out how

943
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:14,029
to do is micro engineering stuff some of

<font color="#CCCCCC">my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite college here so and I</font>

946
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:23,660
on why did you multicast that's my point

947
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:25,910
there and v6 we've got folks that are

948

participating in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixth bone and</font>

949
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:30,819
we'll go there when the industry is

950
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:33,080
ready and then my final point there's

951
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,460
where's all the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean this is</font>

952
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,950
extremely important<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think is a niche</font>

953
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,930
that's being created there to glean

954
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,180
information about your system or about

955
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">your network to understand where</font>

956
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,710
everything is going to measure

957
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:47,600
statistics on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rate and those changes</font>

958
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:51,950
in where it's going or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the performance</font>

959
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:53,480
thereof my point is i'd love to not have

960
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:56,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to a third party to buy something</font>

961
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this sniff for two or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to split</font>

962
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">off some of that signal from my fibers</font>

963
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,550
to figure out what it's all doing it

964
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,910
should it should be integrated<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

third party box that lunges and does

967
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,680
something about data that's that's cool

968
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:14,060
but on the edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> i won't get integrated</font>

969
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,240
so some remain issues for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us as were</font>

things to secure a lot of thought has

1000
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,500
gone into how to manage things which

1001
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,300
were left on people's walls outside

1002

their houses are outside their places of

1003
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,520
businesses or on telephone poles one way

<font color="#CCCCCC">the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet then your risk</font>

1013
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:32,680
is pretty minimal in a box which has<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1014
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:35,390
access into it because it's welded shut

1015
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,680
of course someone can go and physically

1016
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,629
destroy your blocks or physically

1017
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,109
destroy the wires or cables going into

1018
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:43,450
it this is a bigger risk than

00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:45,730
one location facilities which are

1020
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,080
extremely dense the problem with one

targets as we found the other week

1024
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:56,049
unfortunately and making them redundant

1025
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:57,850
can be ridiculously<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive as well so</font>

1026
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,320
you know there are trade-offs all over

1027
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,990
the place it really depends on<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

or a centralized approach may make more

boxes need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do this stuff</font>

1049
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:49,330
for you you've got a heckler signature

1053
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,800
that it can do that so then you've got

1054
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,750
this problem with the trade-off so this

1055
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to take you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cycles and</font>

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,970
move packets which is really were even

1058

two verses you're going to compromise

1059
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:09,970
some of that or maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's the</font>

1060
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:13,090

1067
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:28,660
haven't seen the level of effort there

00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,350
on the vendors that give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

attention it<font color="#CCCCCC"> awards so that we would</font>

infrastructure you know we grew on you

00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,490
know you want that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that alarm</font>

1078
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,720
you want you

1080
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:04,839
that's the goal as far as I see so I

1081
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:06,790
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there's a lot of really</font>

00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:27,069
there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on that that</font>

1089
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:29,890
matches<font color="#CCCCCC"> are this is bad criteria right</font>

1090
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:32,740
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think with what I would love to</font>

1091
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:35,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">see is you folks that are actually doing</font>

1092
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:37,868
that to get together with some of the

1093
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:39,459
vendors who aren't doing it does i mean

1094
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:44,350
the hardware vendors so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

1095
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:46,390
routing stuff and and not require us to

00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to kind of underscored</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn's play</font>

1097
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,660
another requires to deploy a bunch more

1098
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,119
equipment to do that it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1099
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:56,009
integrated so it's a single single

00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,010
infrastructure single box or equal

<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks there's a question there in the</font>

1102
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:08,680
back yeah the question is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1103
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:10,990
diversity in talking Ron earlier you

00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">said keep it simple keep it standard and</font>

1105
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:14,618
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've seen in a</font>

1106
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:17,290
lot of cases even when there is a

1107
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:18,880
standard one vendors implementation of

1108
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:21,759
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard whether it be at the laser</font>

1109
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,800
chipset level or at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routing</font>

1110
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:28,630
level probably works best with that same

00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:30,609
vendors other gear looking at the Terra

1112
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,810
pop design seems to be a little bit

1113
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:33,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">different from looking at the exchange</font>

1114
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:37,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">point design and that a lot of times</font>

1115
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,310
people go with a single vendor for

1116
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,430
everything and I wondered what the panel

1117
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:43,750
thought about just how much diversity

1118
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:46,270
you're willing to tolerate from a

1119
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:48,040
management perspective and what that

1120
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">means for the kind of diversity</font>

1124
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:16,400
that's a lot of questions to try and

1125
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:17,779
answer gracefully so I don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can really answer the question very</font>

1127
00:48:17,779 --> 00:48:24,439
very wealth and from the diversity of

1128
00:48:19,279 --> 00:48:25,789
perspective you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on you can get</font>

1129
00:48:24,439 --> 00:48:26,928
diverse with different vendors right and

1130
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:28,429
you've got the standards issue but as

1131

far as diversity goes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the carrier's</font>

1132
00:48:28,429 --> 00:48:32,689
perspective you're only ever going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1133
00:48:30,859 --> 00:48:33,919
as diverse as your physical plant is and

00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:39,288
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just nothing you can do about</font>

00:48:33,919 --> 00:48:40,819
that in it you know some act of god

1136
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:42,289
takes out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> building on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your physical</font>

1137

1138
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:46,279
it's not that that's what happens I'm

1139
00:48:44,569 --> 00:48:48,109
sorry and then specifically vendor

1140
00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:49,609
diversity<font color="#E5E5E5"> day here diversity well you</font>

1141
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:53,449
mentioned Sean earlier and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1142
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:54,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">you were implying that as well um so</font>

1143
00:48:53,449 --> 00:48:56,209
you're right there's been a diversity in

1144
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:59,989
infinite diversity issues and there's

1145
00:48:56,209 --> 00:49:01,669
thunder thunder a and implements

1146
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:05,029
multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> prefer than vendor be and</font>

1147
00:49:01,669 --> 00:49:06,828
there's some bgp idiosyncrasies and

1148
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:08,839
stuff like that and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a one</font>

1149
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:10,669
vendor network you're usually assured

1150
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:17,209
that stuff will work properly but that's

1151
00:49:10,669 --> 00:49:19,729
not always the case either so the

1152
00:49:17,209 --> 00:49:21,169
decision for us as a large carrier comes

1153
00:49:19,729 --> 00:49:22,939
down to what's the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost effective</font>

1154
00:49:21,169 --> 00:49:24,408
course is it more cost effective for us

1155
00:49:22,939 --> 00:49:25,729
to manage to vendors and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with</font>

1156
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:27,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the headaches that comes with that and</font>

1157
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,968
the different implementations of the

1158
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:30,259
different gear<font color="#E5E5E5"> at cetera et cetera or so</font>

1159
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:32,449
we get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better return our money by just</font>

1160
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:34,939
having one vendor dealing with the

1161
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:38,269
issues that come with that as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1162
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:39,949

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the carriers are</font>

1167

probably going to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> long and</font>

1168
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:50,900
hard I'll be honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> will think about</font>

1169
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:53,479
that wall in part what what's you know

1170
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,239
so today we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a diversity</font>

1171
00:49:53,479 --> 00:49:59,569
issues were just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> end and that's</font>

1172
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:02,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so I probably not a fair person to</font>

00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:05,538
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> that how about mr. grace on the end</font>

1174
00:50:02,029 --> 00:50:09,069
then mr. Grayson<font color="#CCCCCC"> sweeteners in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> late I</font>

1175
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:11,450
would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

1176
00:50:09,069 --> 00:50:13,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming between vendors is at least</font>

1177
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:15,890
as difficult as<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing between</font>

1178
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">duckling providers the question is why</font>

1179
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,640
do you choose one versus the other one

1180
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,960
of the things that comes up on nano all

1181
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,640
the time as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi home between</font>

1182
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,619
Backman providers and find out they're

1183
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,109
sharing the same piece of fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1184
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:28,640
gets cut oops so what happens when

1185
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:31,339
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharing the same piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

1186
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,019
which gets a bug in it the genetics of a

1187
00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:35,150
lot of the code out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and a lot of</font>

1188
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:38,660
vendors is pretty damn similar and

1189
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:41,180
that's somewhat spooky to me software

1190
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:43,970
diversity is a bit of a shimmer right

1191
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,680
now despite the fact that I know the

1192
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,788
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different styles of many of the</font>

1193
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,038
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are writing different</font>

1194
00:50:46,789 --> 00:50:50,809
implementations we're still stuck with

1195
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,869
the same standards and the obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

1196
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:56,150
of doing things and the obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs</font>

1197
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:57,829
will fall in and the unhealthiest bugs

1198
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:00,559
will probably get found in many

1199
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:02,630
different places rather than just one so

1200
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,970
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you're a backbone</font>

1201
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:07,579
operator do you want to take the risk of

1202
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:09,169
your entire background goes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1203
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:10,940
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coding mistake done by one vendor</font>

1204
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:13,220
or a hardware problem or a supply

1205
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:16,730
problem or what have you versus the

1206
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:20,299
possibility of oops one fire that you

1207
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:23,660
have to fight today is from vendor a but

1208
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:25,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> fire is dwarfed by the fire later</font>

1209
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:29,029
on in the afternoon caused<font color="#CCCCCC"> by vendor B's</font>

1210
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:32,089
reaction to the change<font color="#CCCCCC"> its fixed the</font>

1211
00:51:29,029 --> 00:51:34,640
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> fire seen it happen ultimately</font>

1212
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:36,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">what it comes down to is that like with</font>

1213
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing there are trade-offs there</font>

1214
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:41,299
are costs people will make up their own

1215
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:44,419
minds like with Ted we are a cisco only

1216
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:47,329
shop and there are good reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

1217
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:49,279
in my mind I believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> other networks</font>

1218
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:53,200
would differ rather strenuously and

1219
00:51:49,279 --> 00:51:53,200
maybe you're one of them

1220
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:08,580
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't comment on that but um the</font>

1221
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:12,640
vendor diversity issue I think you can

1222
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:13,690
divide it into two basic areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1223
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,790
that you guys covered if there's an

1224
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:17,530
economic<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue does it does it make</font>

1225
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:18,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense economically to do it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

1226
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:21,610
a twist to maybe the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were</font>

1227
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:24,790
describing their tags and that is having

1228
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">a second vendor may when they underscore</font>

1229
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:30,640
that several times may help negotiate

1230
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:34,480
pricing with you know your other vendor

1231
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:37,540
for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> other vendors um but if you</font>

1232
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,480
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> undermine so but then the other</font>

1233
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">side of it is definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the operational</font>

1234
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,520
is concerned operational concern there

1235
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:48,400
if vendor a is unstable in this

1236
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,720
particular amount of time it's nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1237
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,280
have a second vendor so that you've got

1238
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">some stability at least on part of your</font>

1239
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:58,030
network of course there's always the

1240
00:52:53,110 --> 00:53:00,760
risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> of instability triggers instability</font>

1241
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:02,830
from A to B and your total<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes but I</font>

1242
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:07,330
guess that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of impossible else you</font>

1243
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:09,700
do your hardware head we also final

1244
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:11,799
impolite point is that you run the risk

1245
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,330
of a denial<font color="#E5E5E5"> of service attack done by</font>

in the bag hi I'm Rachel worn from

1251
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,650
of a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Ron oh I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vent you had a little thing upon</font>

your<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerPoint presentation saying that</font>

1256
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,610
bandwidth consumption would outpace the

1257
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:52,390
cost of decreased bandwidth why do you

1258
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:54,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen so um first of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen and that is when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

look at

maybe the posting 768 optics right I

1264
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:13,080
mean how how much sooner are we going to

1265
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:16,440
jump to the next stage and thus have you

1274
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:40,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so maybe when we get there we'll</font>

1275
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:43,049
have an answer but what if when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1276
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,359
there our answer is well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of</font>

1277
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best technology is going to do for</font>

1278
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:51,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next so many years at which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

1279
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:53,130
there's no further optimization I think

1280
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:55,460
that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done there and thus you know</font>

1281
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,960
your costs aren't going to keep dropping

1282
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,250
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer the question well</font>

1283
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,070
couldn't they just you know up the

1284
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:03,900
bandwidth costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much that you know</font>

1285
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:07,730
because once you get to a certain point

1286
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:10,140
if there's more people than there are

1287
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:14,840
bandwidth you can up the price so much

1288
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:17,129
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget my question was going to be</font>

1289
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:19,260
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't you might not have that</font>

1290
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:24,000
problem if you just up the bandwidth

1291
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:27,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs so much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would imagine if I made</font>

1292
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,910
it I'm sure so that's that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry no</font>

1293
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:33,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">marketing or economic twist to it right</font>

1294
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:36,330
as the provider of the infrastructure

1295
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can increase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost in it and</font>

1296
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:40,350
guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just did what I said</font>

1297
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:42,570
which is you lowers where you decrease

1298
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:45,810
the rate at which it was enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

here that the polity should always look

00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this because we have a layout of</font>

the reality is when you have customers

on your network you know it always

00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:12,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">just build it soundly and you do right</font>

1394
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:28,710
so that's kind of how we do it

1395
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,180
everything's diverse everything's for

1396
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:32,069
the better worse it's logically divorce

1397
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,629
or two either everything and we're

1398
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:38,220
carrier ok so we build them that look

1399
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:40,049
like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think like I said</font>

1400
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,879
it doesn't help the customer when it's

1401
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:46,140
his copper pair that's listed and that's

1402
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:47,819
why he's down yes yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's true but I</font>

1403
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,990
mean I have enormous respect for sprint

<font color="#CCCCCC">Nick in the way they continue to do</font>

1405

1406
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:54,180
multi second editors<font color="#E5E5E5"> never happened</font>

1407
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:56,220
readers never crash<font color="#E5E5E5"> for years never</font>

1408
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:58,200
happened no I didn't say routers never

1409
00:59:56,220 --> 01:00:00,000
crashed but so when the router crashes

1410
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,009
and those sets of wide area network

1411
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,839
links go down there's a whole nother set

1412
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:07,230
there on another router that hopefully

1413
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:08,790
is still up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it's a it's a cycle</font>

1414
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,809
time between those impressions right you

1415
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,930
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen at the same</font>

1416
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:15,110
time

1417
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:17,240
alright well be one second<font color="#CCCCCC"> Peter is that</font>

1418
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:19,220
you better yeah Robert Robert Robert

1419
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,870
crashing is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font>

1420
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,910
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should crash more often</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1421
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:27,950
longer because that way we ensure we

1422
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:31,129
have it with on the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

1423
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:33,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">enemy's router should crash Peter</font>

1424
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:34,850
believes that British crashing is a good

1425
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:38,529
thing because this encourages the

1426
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:38,529
development of redundant networks I

1427
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:48,050
guess point one different perspective i

1428
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:50,030
can add to the go ahead is their comment

1429
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:52,280
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to comment that I think</font>

1430
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:57,020
SL eyes with three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> or five nines a</font>

1431
01:00:52,280 --> 01:01:00,890
bunch of marketing BS degree I don't

1432
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:07,100
understand why we're addressing that in

1433
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:11,029
the industry I mean why are people in

1434
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:13,759
this room asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> x percent up times</font>

1435
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:19,400
when they're buying services from people

1436
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:27,770
like us we will tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

1437
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:29,930
on it exercising failure and observing

1438
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:32,060
that redundancy works is good but having

1439
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:33,830
all of your router's crash because of a

1440
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:36,380
single packet that triggers a bug in

1441
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:38,029
your major router vendors software is a

1442
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:42,020
bad thing because then none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1443
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:52,040
circuits are up yes thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

1444
01:01:42,020 --> 01:02:00,820
insight so Ted I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask his ATM</font>

1445
01:01:52,040 --> 01:02:04,640
dead yesterday they say I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

1446
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:06,350
so the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrying further is you</font>

1447
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,480
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean Sean presented that ethernet</font>

1448
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:11,089
is king and you're presenting that am

1449
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,070
sorry you mentioned that ATM sir sorry

1450
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:18,380
ethernet services can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> delivered to</font>

1451
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:19,850
customers and and Ted recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

1452
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,980
company has changed its service offering

1453
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:24,509
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there kind of related back to New</font>

1454
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,609
new and interesting technology deserves

1455
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:28,109
that can be deployed does this now open

1456
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:30,299
up sprint<font color="#E5E5E5"> and new and interesting</font>

1457
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:32,279
services that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be deployed so it's a</font>

1458
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:35,640
real quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> question so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the truth</font>

1459
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the matter is the service delivery</font>

1460
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,940
options in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe and the service</font>

1461
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,430
delivery options in the domestic us<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1462
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:44,520
180 degrees out of phase of one another

1463
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:45,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so over there people can put</font>

1464
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,850
fiber in the grounding have done so

1465
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:49,200
quite liberally over here when people

1466
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,180
put fiber in the ground they do is a

1467
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,529
collective little coalition and they all

1468
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,060
lay fiber down the same street together

1469
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,710
at the same time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you've got a</font>

1470
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:59,220
wonderful amount of fiber within like

1471
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:02,700
this one straight wide width go a block

1472
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:04,560
off it no fiber and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> all bill do the</font>

1473
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,868
same bright shiny tall buildings so

1474
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:10,020
you've got real server service offerings

1475
01:03:06,869 --> 01:03:11,820
that right um so you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

1476
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,800
um so there's some interesting work

1477
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:15,750
being done in the ITF you know team or

1478
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,160
ethernet over copper like t1 type

1479
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:19,830
servers and stuff like that that might

1480
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:22,430
change it you know I mentioned it in my

1481
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:24,660
talk you know there's an access paradigm

1482
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:28,109
shift that needs to happen here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1483
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:30,660
US for for that to happen and there are

1484
01:03:28,109 --> 01:03:32,279
an awful lot of telephone companies that

1485
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:35,190
make an awful<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money what today's</font>

1486
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:37,760
model the way it is who they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

1487
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:41,730
that to happen you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it you know it</font>

1488
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:43,500
they like their copper plant that's paid

1489
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:45,170
for five hundred times over they charge

1490
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,869
you finish collars a month more right

1491
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:51,180
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that changes here in the you know</font>

1492
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:52,500
I'd say no it's not something you're

1493
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:56,009
gonna see an awful lot of you'll see

1494
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,990
pockets of it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may see like bronze</font>

1495
01:03:56,010 --> 01:04:00,480
company you know they've got access to

1496
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:03,509
cable plant and they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that but</font>

1497
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,470
it's you know it doesn't hit a majority

1498
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:10,640
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market in the US and its pockets</font>

1499
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:10,640
did I<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer your question sure</font>

1500
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:20,459
your company was your original question

1501
01:04:17,749 --> 01:04:22,589
basically was the change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in service</font>

1502
01:04:20,459 --> 01:04:24,660
offerings that are now<font color="#CCCCCC"> being that are</font>

1503
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:26,308
now able due to technology changes and

1504
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:29,129
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to affect your next</font>

1505
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:31,769
genders on I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was about</font>

1506
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:35,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">eternity if that's one service offering</font>

1507
01:04:31,769 --> 01:04:38,218
that could be later yeah so um I think I

1508
01:04:35,369 --> 01:04:41,759
think some exciting service offerings

1509
01:04:38,219 --> 01:04:47,279
from my perspective have been the advent

1510
01:04:41,759 --> 01:04:49,499
of lambda services in some situations it

1511
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:51,690
makes sense of size<font color="#CCCCCC"> arcs fiber well when</font>

1512
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:53,459
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the economic sometimes there's no</font>

1513
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:57,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">break even point there anytime soon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1514
01:04:53,459 --> 01:04:59,009
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider point-to-point from</font>

1515
01:04:57,209 --> 01:05:02,339
you know pointed from your two different

1516
01:04:59,009 --> 01:05:04,499
applications so on it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically</font>

1517
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:07,950
very unattractive and there's some

1518
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:10,259
really nice efficiencies available in a

1519
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:12,359
lambda service and I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because</font>

1520
01:05:10,259 --> 01:05:14,009
then in some cases at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1521
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:15,538
bring it with whatever you want whatever

1522
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:17,729
these are neither sonnet or whatever you

1523
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:20,369
stick on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of it not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not all</font>

1524
01:05:17,729 --> 01:05:22,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">um land the service providers do that</font>

1525
01:05:20,369 --> 01:05:25,890
stuff but some of them what you do

1526
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:28,650
whatever technology you want that's cool

1527
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:30,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just want say one more thing I'll</font>

1528
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:31,380
probably fired now for making fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1529
01:05:30,089 --> 01:05:35,180
those phone companies at<font color="#CCCCCC"> choice of</font>

1530
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:38,670
dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> for copper pairs by the way I</font>

1531
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:40,440
won't be our CEO likes to talk very very

1532
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:41,999
harshly that the fact that for example

1533
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the United Kingdom which is</font>

1534
01:05:41,999 --> 01:05:46,169
occasionally considered part of Europe

1535
01:05:43,549 --> 01:05:48,239
last year is a number of copper

1536
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:51,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Elizabeth's which were unbundled amount</font>

1537
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:54,599
into 37<font color="#E5E5E5"> total this is in the country of</font>

1538
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:56,489
some 50 some odd million people it's not

1539
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:58,410
uniform across Europe there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are places</font>

1540
01:05:56,489 --> 01:06:00,359
which are lucky like Stockholm there are

1541
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:03,348
places which are unlucky like the United

1542
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:06,299
Kingdom or Ireland or what have you

1543
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:08,579
really what it comes down to is is there

1544
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:11,819
a will on the part of everyone involved

1545
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:14,150
to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the issue that the lines</font>

1546
01:06:11,819 --> 01:06:16,890
going from people's houses all go to

1547
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:19,259
facilities controlled by former

1548
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:21,839
monopolies or existing monopolies yes no

1549
01:06:19,259 --> 01:06:23,950
if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is no there's no will to</font>

1550
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:25,869
fix this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new services will be</font>

1551
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:27,460
a long time in coming and will trickle

1552
01:06:25,869 --> 01:06:28,869
down from the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who can afford it</font>

1553
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:30,579

power around and so forth maybe your

1607
01:08:33,219 --> 01:08:35,660
answer is a little different in

California<font color="#CCCCCC"> last summer</font>

this summer who knows so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1610
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,750
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to depend on the overall</font>

we<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill accordingly to support it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

1618
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,450
tiny issue in a cost issue and it comes

01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,800
down to which<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our sites truly merit</font>

1620
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:12,260
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that size of scale and</font>

1621
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,760
magnitude if you go down that<font color="#CCCCCC"> path so</font>

1622
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:15,470
you have to make that decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> up front</font>

1623
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:18,410
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance before you pick that punch</font>

1624
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:21,020
I think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a combination</font>

1625
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:22,939
of both<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you know as i stated</font>

1626
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:24,500
then you gotta push up closer to the

customer leads your capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:29,270
back halter etc and at the same time

1629
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,800
you've got corners where you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

1630
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:33,110
much traffic that you use whether you've

01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:35,120
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> affording you know in route that</font>

1632
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:37,120
require these kind of boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

1633
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,229
talking about so in those facilities

01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that no choice you've got to bite the</font>

bullet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't just say all right one</font>

1636
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:46,519
the eight routers of this site are done

1637
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:49,790
and I can't add<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more i'm going to</font>

1638
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:51,830
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it off or I can't move it and got</font>

1639
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:54,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">an argument what's there you know if I'm</font>

1640
01:09:51,830 --> 01:10:00,160
committed to staying in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business</font>

pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut and dry run</font>

1642
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:06,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">our power cooling and bees in it wait</font>

1643
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:09,080
wait right so maybe that's funny i'm

1644
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:12,380
thinking of an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think of some</font>

1645
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:14,300
some space that we were in where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

1646
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:16,400
an upgrade and then we later found out

1647
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:18,470
oh and by the way because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weight</font>

1648
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:21,339
constraints you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to you know put</font>

1649
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:24,200
those those devices only in X number

1650
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:25,700
rack units<font color="#CCCCCC"> hidden</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proximity of each</font>

1651
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:29,950
other you can't have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so many in</font>

1652
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:32,210
so anyways it's very important for us

1653
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:36,099
when you look at all three<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

1654
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:38,600
factors<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's going to take another</font>

1655
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:40,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple more cooling units and there's no</font>

1656
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:44,780
space to put them or that space is going

1657
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:48,470
to eat up your your color availability

1658
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:50,630
there then that's that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> showstopper</font>

1659
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:53,000
right because it you know if the device

1660
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:56,450
is it is too heavy can eat up to it's

1661
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,250
too hot or draws too much power you have

1662
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:59,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">to move it to a new location because I'm</font>

1663
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:01,780
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know that locations</font>

1664
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:06,110
out of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those resources the</font>

1665
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:07,490
expense of building the new pop is you

1666
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:09,110
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than just moving</font>

1667
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:10,969
equipment to me with new location it's

1668
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:14,089
all this infrastructure that's probably

1669
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:16,720
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> there so the dark fiber that you</font>

1670
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:19,190
may have secured into that building the

1671
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:21,380
hearings that might be terminated into

1672
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:24,290
that building a web stuff it becomes

1673
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:27,290
very expensive to just find a new

1674
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:31,910
location so businesses are very

1675
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:35,990
important question in the back yes like

1676
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask the entire panel if you've had to</font>

1677
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:44,059
deal with questions as to what layer of

1678
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:45,470
the network to rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on for resiliency in</font>

1679
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:46,730
other words if you've got an optical

1680
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:49,460
switch that gives you may be four

1681
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:55,820
different choices for different levels

1682
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:58,520
of automatic reconfiguration what you're

1683
01:11:55,820 --> 01:12:01,429
thinking has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether okay do i do</font>

our rely upon layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three versus the</font>

1686
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:11,089
do I take go to go with a lower level of

01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,980
automatic reconfiguration<font color="#E5E5E5"> of layer 2</font>

1688
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:17,410

and then have your entire enterprise go

1694
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,760
down when that pops loses power right so

1695
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:35,470
you have to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like component by</font>

1696
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,360
component then also on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system level</font>

1697
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:40,030
so if you're if you're considering a

1698
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,160
point-to-point link between one your

1699
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:45,910
backbone routers in pop a and<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

1700
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:49,210
backs on router<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top be if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um you know</font>

1701
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:51,010
you've got diversity there that's good

1702
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:52,660
so when you bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> up your second your</font>

1703
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:54,280
second link is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> important that you</font>

1704
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:56,440
have diversity well okay there are two

1705
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:58,210
different paths we've got physical

1706
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,690
redundancy great now now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1707
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:03,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layer which might be a</font>

1708
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:05,320
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two component is this on it that</font>

1709
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:07,000
important anymore and if it's a sonnet

1710
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,469
frame circuit well not if you've got two

1711
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,989
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but if you have one might have</font>

1712
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:13,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at you know implementing linear</font>

1713
01:13:10,989 --> 01:13:16,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">ApS it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> critical for</font>

1714
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:17,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">that circus always be up from the bed</font>

1715
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:19,720
introduces all these operational

1716
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,400
problems with managing when you're a PS

1717
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">circuits and how much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't in</font>

1718
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:27,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact and then finally you have to look</font>

1719
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three if you lose that IP</font>

1720
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:34,960
path in your IDP what happens to entire

1721
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:37,000
technology I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you can say one</font>

1722
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,950
is more important than the other you

1723
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,400
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those different</font>

1724
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:49,150
layers at each part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1725
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:52,660
then on the entire enterprise so

1726
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:54,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">something's there from what is really</font>

1727
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:57,489
standards there you mentioned optical

1728
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:59,110
cross connect for an optical switch so

1729
01:13:57,489 --> 01:14:00,790
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no real standard very up for</font>

1730
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:02,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> today I mean how many short recess</font>

1731
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:04,630
you want auntie standards are their

1732
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:06,400
proposed right now some of them aren't

1733
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:08,739
even capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traversing an optical</font>

1734
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,620
cross connect and the other issue in

1735
01:14:08,739 --> 01:14:13,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shawn's slide showed this in his DWDM a</font>

1736
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:15,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">drop capabilities the optical cross</font>

1737
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:17,260
connects out there today have a very

1738
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:18,530
limited amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> express traffic</font>

1739
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:21,079
capacity and a draw

1740
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:25,280
capacity so it's kind of an immature

1741
01:14:21,079 --> 01:14:30,500
technology as I see it a couple years

1742
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:32,239
out it may not be so for sprint we just

1743
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:34,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">used the DW implant that's in place</font>

1744
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:37,909
today and use it physical diversity

1745
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:39,920
approach any layer 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> pro protection we</font>

1746
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:43,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">have no more sign infrastructure in our</font>

1747
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:45,320
backbone although all of our customer

1748
01:14:43,369 --> 01:14:48,980
circuits are all<font color="#CCCCCC"> sonic protected until</font>

1749
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:51,530
they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're their target router so</font>

1750
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:53,150
it's in as Ron said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> come and have to</font>

1751
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:54,650
look any value at all three but then you

1752
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:56,449
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at what your what your</font>

1753
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:58,969
options available are as far as your

1754
01:14:56,449 --> 01:15:01,638
physical plant and you your capabilities

1755
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:02,719
and what you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use and you're</font>

1756
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:09,860
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a slave to your</font>

1757
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:12,380
routing protocol right well I'm in two

1758
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:14,239
minds about this and in one sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ron is</font>

1759
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:17,300
right you should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that everywhere</font>

1760
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:19,218
possible and make a choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> about whether</font>

1761
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:22,039
and this layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is cheaper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than a not</font>

1762
01:15:19,219 --> 01:15:24,500
layer however if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

1763
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:27,380
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clean separation between OSI</font>

1764
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:29,510
reference model layers and treat those

1765
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:31,849
drugs pretty seriously can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you study</font>

1766
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:34,520
want to ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself why is it that any</font>

1767
01:15:31,849 --> 01:15:36,739
given layer and is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make any</font>

1768
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:40,940
assumptions at all about any layer and

1769
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:42,468
minus one well you know an OSI land they

1770
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:44,058
had the connection lesson

1771
01:15:42,469 --> 01:15:46,610
connection-oriented service which

1772
01:15:44,059 --> 01:15:49,460
offered different reliability guarantees

1773
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:52,909
and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth application</font>

1774
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:55,010
should really really be take a

1775
01:15:52,909 --> 01:15:56,960
universalist approach to what they're

1776
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:58,699
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one another across in</font>

1777
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:02,210
terms of performance in terms of

1778
01:15:58,699 --> 01:16:04,190
reliability yeah you can lean on<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and</font>

1779
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:06,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">say yeah TTP is going to deal with all</font>

1780
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:07,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this except for maybe a long term</font>

1781
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,949
that is a persistent reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop of</font>

1782
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:11,570
crash at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end you name it you</font>

1783
01:16:09,949 --> 01:16:13,699
could also take the approach just as

1784
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:16,400
easily that why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we leave it to the</font>

1785
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:18,769
application like Luke<font color="#E5E5E5"> msdp done by some</font>

1786
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:21,409
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bsd projects which goes and does</font>

1787
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:23,780
aggressive restarts and tries to resume

1788
01:16:21,409 --> 01:16:25,519
the download of a file even if you have

1789
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:27,289
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long term outage caused by something</font>

1790
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> none of the other layers can cope</font>

1791
01:16:27,289 --> 01:16:30,650
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's an application by</font>

1792
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:32,239
application decision what

1793
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:34,219
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that everything is</font>

1794
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:35,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">given to you already is sufficient or</font>

1795
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:45,230
whether you have to add something new

1796
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:50,800
and for extra resiliency there's no more

1797
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:50,799
question yes thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>
