1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:11,610
okay so this is me and we were fortunate

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,500
enough to have a lot of very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,759
talks that were proposed for the snow

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:22,800
nog in in this area<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were calling</font>

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">a DGP dynamics track but they're they're</font>

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,920
also a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stocks</font>

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,609
we're talking about trending and

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,500
operational issues so um this is sort of

9
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,899
my own working title for this session

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,899
and this is also attract which isn't

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,020
exactly a panel but it's something like

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,770
a panel so we'll see how this goes so my

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,579
agenda for this track is first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,430

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,710
logistics and then I want to since all

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,660
of these talks were or most of these

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,680
talks are based on a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data</font>

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,059
collection I want to give you a little

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">to what these talks are going to be</font>

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,700
about and then do and then do the talks

24

and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see these slides or</font>

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,720
some earlier slightly earlier version of

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,520
them there and that URL um ok so the

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,890
logistics of this first<font color="#E5E5E5"> off we have a</font>

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,649
few discontinuities in our schedule in

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,780
our in our agenda and there are sort of

30
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,729
the air and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open mic if you notice on</font>

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,890
the updated agenda is sort of in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

32
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,140
middle which is okay and then we have

33
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,850
some breaks and lunch and so forth so

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,229
what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do is please let's</font>

35
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,839
hold the questions to the end of all the

36
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,110
talks but please<font color="#E5E5E5"> send them to questions</font>

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,880
at nana org and put on bgp panel and

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,929
some tagged about your question that

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,789
really doesn't matter what you put there

40
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,049
and Lucille collect them all up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

41
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,729
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end hopefully we'll have some</font>

42
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,340
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> what will have some time only at</font>

43
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end okay and the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing I</font>

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,390
want to say about the updated agendas

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,380
that I think Susan did a really

46
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,850
wonderful job of moving things around so

47
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,439
we could have the maximum amount of time

48
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,850
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,280
good talks on a good topic so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

50
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,609
the logistics<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's go on with</font>

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">this bgp data sources on</font>

52
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">i happen to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in collecting</font>

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,840
some data so I I know a little bit about

54
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:21,049
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one um the first one I wanted to</font>

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,380
talk about was the right routing

56
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,490
information project which is I don't

57
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have looked at this</font>

58
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,460
but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a substantial project which</font>

59
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,560
is capturing quite a bit of data and

60
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,690
what they're using is zebra bgp be and

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,940
I'm the real nice thing about this is

62
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:42,470
that the zebra bgp d can archive it has

63
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,570
its own internal archiving mechanism on

64
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">help anyways look at this but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

65
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:51,620
doesn't marching format are kind of

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,989
being of the rib and updates and mr key

67
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,400
that's URL if you're innocent<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr key so</font>

68
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,310
that's that's one of the major sources

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,470
and I think I Pegasus talk and maybe a

70
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,950
couple of the others use data that

71
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:07,910
they've gone out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this project i have</font>

72
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:11,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">my own which is route views and this</font>

73
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:14,090
thing is on capturing feel IP bgp

74
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,400
formats<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco format at two-hour</font>

75
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,980
intervals and i would have a nice

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">descriptive genre to do it earlier on</font>

77
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,320
uh-huh oh the archive of that data is on

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,000
this thing called archive.org and a lot

79
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,160
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people a lot of people seem to be</font>

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,489
archiving it themselves um you can just

81
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,890
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there if you want and there was</font>

82
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:36,830
an earlier archive predating when I have

83
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:44,779
that Hans Werner had on<font color="#CCCCCC"> moda and liners</font>

84
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:46,730
not yet bill has um is archiving some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

85
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,049
this data as well on PCH then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

86
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,310
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exact URL he might want</font>

87
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:53,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he comes up a</font>

88
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:55,430
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there's any number of</font>

89
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,860
looking glasses out there there's a good

90
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,440
list on I'm this is a really archival

91
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,090
but there are a lot of looking glasses

92
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,829
up out there that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people used to find</font>

93
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,989
this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then finally there's</font>

94
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,730
there's quite a few private listeners

95
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,190
and private archives that people are

96
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,200
running so the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data we have is</font>

97
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,790
really on the routing system<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

98
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,530
growing and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really pretty</font>

99
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:19,358
impressive if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at what some of</font>

100
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,380
these some of these projects have done I

101
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,640
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit about refuse</font>

102
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,380
because that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> line know about a</font>

103
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,419
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about the history of it and</font>

104
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,469
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened last month or whenever</font>

105
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:32,750
that was that I broke<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so badly so the</font>

106
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,190
history of this thing is about 1995<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

107
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,039
was building some network stuff in

108
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,750
Oregon and I really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see I</font>

109
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:42,349
needed a way of looking at how other

110
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,570
providers were seeing my routes and so

111
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:46,729
the whole rap use<font color="#E5E5E5"> project really started</font>

112
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,060
life is just an operational tool for me

113
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:51,440
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal thing and as I said I needed</font>

114
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,169
a way for it to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that were</font>

115
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,700
looking at my routes and there were no

116
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,280
looking glasses that was something that

117
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,130
was off in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future um still I think</font>

118
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,890
ed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kern had one up I was night sir</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Bush gimme on he DGP multi knob session</font>

122
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,760
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mae West and I think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was online</font>

123
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:21,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">could Cisco 2500 at the time believed</font>

124
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:23,390
that so um people started<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked me can</font>

125
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">they use it and yeah and I you know</font>

126
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,590
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a password on it and I did</font>

127
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,140
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid things like didn't turn</font>

128
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:34,969
out to all not all of these things and

129
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:37,940
ok so we learned our lessons and then at

130
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,740
some point um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> casey who</font>

131
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,000
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was like after we</font>

132
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,120
have all these views and there's a

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,220
couple of hundred meds<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a pat of pads</font>

134
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,979
in there she realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is sort</font>

135
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,229
of a data source and when this picture

136
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">came out I started getting a lot more</font>

137
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:54,919
people asking me if they could

138
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,130
contribute these so I usually I mean I

139
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,210
haven't haven't stopped acquiring<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

140
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,520
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that things become more</font>

141
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:06,289
useful over time so there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

142
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation thanks to Cisco it's a they</font>

143
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:12,890
donated a this box because it wouldn't

144
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,780
run on anything smaller any more it I

145
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,570
mean have to be running<font color="#CCCCCC"> 19's on the rain</font>

146
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,210
well has about 63 peers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

147
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,030
fluctuates a little bit there's about

148
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven hundred thousand cows in it a</font>

149
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:28,260
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred megs of rib and it takes</font>

150
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,030
about four thousand connections a day

151
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,880
what people just looking at it for

152
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,650
either archival operational use innocent

153
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,210
and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the archive we see</font>

154
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,229
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's about 50 downloads I don't</font>

155
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,200
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing with this</font>

156
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,480
data but they're certainly getting it so

157
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,810
that's that's the state of the world as

158
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,700
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> said right now so I had a few issues</font>

159
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,440
I just want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention a few issues if</font>

160
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,900
you plan on<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

161
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,130
first off if you have it we have will

162
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,669
enter your whole thing about acceptable

163
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">use but the of the data but the what we</font>

164
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,840
what we end up doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dropping</font>

165
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,380
that obviously processor and memory

166
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,179
scaling in this box is a problem because

167
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,760
it's taking a lot of updates sticking on

168
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> data export thing is a problem we</font>

169
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,430
had a lot of trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> with just getting</font>

170
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,260
the show ID bgp out of it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

171
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically that there was so much data in</font>

172
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,640
it that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuck on the other side</font>

173
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,320
kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> dying and fortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sean put some</font>

174
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">african to kind of working around that</font>

175
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,870
for us Pierce come and go people call me

176
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,310
up and say hey you know you have 15 dead

177
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,770
peers on this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there you know</font>

178
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,840
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to you have to you know kind</font>

179
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,789
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch that and resolve them and going</font>

180
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,890
along<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that since actually people</font>

181
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">are customers you never get you never</font>

182
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,000
find out that I'm the pure on the other

183
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,260
end of mood or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something until somebody</font>

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,540
calls you and said hey there stud<font color="#E5E5E5"> fears</font>

185
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,860
on this thing oh I know where I support

186
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,880
people are wanting things like ipv6

187
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,320
multicast we have stuff oh and of course

188
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,960
there's all these security issues can

189
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,849
you tell that away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the Bing can ssh</font>

190
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,969
to it can people read your config or see

191
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:02,670
where you tftp that config from people

192
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,900
base that ice devil food system line and

193
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,370
I mean people could see where<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF</font>

194
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,320
repeated from<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and they don't you</font>

195
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it it config not knowing that</font>

196
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things on the web anyway so what to</font>

197
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,890
do with this thing well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to be a</font>

198
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,659
pretty useful operational tool and as

199
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:21,300
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what I wanted to do was</font>

200
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wanted to migrate from the cisco</font>

201
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,390
hardware to bgp zebra<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to pd for a</font>

202
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:30,030
bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons the main one</font>

203
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">was we're trying to unify the data</font>

204
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,419
export format that we have for all these

205
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,000
things so researchers who build tools

206
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:40,679
that work against mrt will have that the

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,450
second thing is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operational end</font>

208
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,459
of it this is

209
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,310
derry by the way the operational end of

210
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,810
it on would would would still be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

211
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,359
because if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get those either be</font>

212
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">gpd to listen on for 23 then you can</font>

213
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:57,080
sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to it looks a little bit like a</font>

214
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:59,120
cisco doesn't have doesn't have these

215
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,710
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> which people mentioned and you</font>

216
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,010
know vertical bars probably a big inning

217
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that much on the grid and</font>

218
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously it's less expensive hardware</font>

219
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,880
so ji built me this box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this thing</font>

220
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,740
you notice until think he likes to do is

221
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,750
say both this<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc would set that was a</font>

222
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,460
pretty big pc and would be good we're

223
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,100
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux for one and i was running</font>

224
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">cbsb but zebra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp d and so I just</font>

225
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,900
thought law just cut it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

226
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,130
what we're on as well be<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPD couldn't</font>

227
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,640
start all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers and there are some</font>

228
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:31,580
issues with the scanner thread<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

229
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,689
CLI thread was really slow and people

230
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,320
called me up and said hey what happened

231
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,940
to its unusable so what to do work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

232
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> v brenton winners look for other</font>

233
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,630
intimate look for other implementations

234
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,490
this one I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask about we could</font>

235
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,660
just replicate it leave the other one

236
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,040
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this for data collection</font>

237
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,719
and there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there right now it's</font>

238
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,719
got about<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty pairs on it thankfully</font>

239
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,960
two people in this community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

240
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,190
tell that to my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that was the</font>

241
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,030
best you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the history</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of how</font>

242
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,560
we're getting all the data from

243
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:04,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">surrounding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here's okay so this</font>

244
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,630
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really what we're here about</font>

245
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,430
and this is sort of the picture that you

246
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,890
know the classic Jeff Houston picture

247
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,079
and this is what we're dealing with and

248
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,510
so what is this what does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> curved</font>

249
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,280
mean well if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a closer look</font>

250
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,630
at that one I'm sorry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this image I</font>

251
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,449
had to shrink it because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

252
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,730
non-deterministic behavior magic point i

253
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,230
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> but basically what is the real</font>

254
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,810
shape of that curve that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

255
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,540
asking and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exponential what can</font>

256
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,849
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do about it so here's the challenge I</font>

257
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,500
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make to all of you folks so</font>

258
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,630
during these talks take a little bit

259
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,250
about the following questions and maybe

260
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,750
I know you all have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of questions</font>

261
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you can think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about these</font>

262
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,920
because I mean are some news myself so

263
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,239
first off is our methodology is sound

264
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,680
thing because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get different views</font>

265
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,330
from different points in the topology

266
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,739
right so what is our methodology for

267
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,450
doing data collection and analysis

268
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,670
you could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these URLs for some</font>

269
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting stuff what a purchase should</font>

270
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,150
we be taking on the research and data

271
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,099
analysis community and what results

272
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be useful for us operation like</font>

273
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,330
these are the kind of things that we'd

274
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:10,830
really like to know when we start

275
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:13,600
talking about ribbon<font color="#E5E5E5"> good growth rates</font>

276
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,310
what is the current growth rate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

277
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,440
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean like is it exponential is</font>

278
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,869
it linear something else and what it

279
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,000
would drive what are the drivers the

280
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,420
more specifics<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming that seems to</font>

281
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,830
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a popular thinness of something else</font>

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,000
or there actually are there actually

283
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,370
problems that we're dealing with related

289
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,930

economy is doing what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dynamic</font>

291
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,239

a cell is it the case that more

297
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:10,210
specifics turn one and was that mean to

298
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,580
us so here's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a hint but</font>

299
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically that / 24 s are much higher</font>

slides on that whatever that URL US and

302
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:22,600
canada so again are there observable

303
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,089
other observable problems related to

304
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,700
that that is there not enough cpu are we

305
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,990
using too much protocol bandwidth and if

306
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,570
that's true again<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's cool so you</font>

307
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,160
have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this if it's not an</font>

308
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,250
operation a problem will it become one

309
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,680
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so there's some I mean</font>

310
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,500
these are sort of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main main focus of</font>

311
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,640
our are thinking in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

312
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,210
there's some other topics to consider

313
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,770
and basically this is this is maybe a

314
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,270
question about the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole thing</font>

315
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,060
is how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> will the current routing</font>

system last mobile Moore's law s us

317
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,739
eventually what about address space

318
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,330
coverage this is a big issue how many

319
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,310
prefixes do we actually need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover</font>

320
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,140
the entire space because I would have

321
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">that lead us to some conclusions about</font>

322
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,770
how we can aggravate how about

323
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,430
configuration issues what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect</font>

00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:10,579
of Miss configuration on

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effective das attacks but we</font>

own systems but were they really ok so

330
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:30,920
now I'm done like 15 seconds here's the

thank you Bill and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

334
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,810

335
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,510
here we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open for</font>

337
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:50,360
strange way that these are related then

338
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,370
uh oh then there's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

339
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:57,080
talk on<font color="#CCCCCC"> letting in stability during Code</font>

340
00:13:52,370 --> 00:14:00,620
Red and in the lunchtime and then Bob

341
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,180
Bob Mellon I think it's pronounced it's

342
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,800
going to give Craig and Ava's talk which

343
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,469
I actually haven't seen that so I'm

344
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,000
interested to see that one and then we

345
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,649
have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of top talks on this</font>

346
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,310
configuration and then a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

347
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:15,440
interesting talk from jingus on the how

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:24,470
down to zero<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so just so um so so</font>

350
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:30,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's send up send questions to Lucy and</font>

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:57,709
oh ok i wanna come sure gragas license

355
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:59,329
yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can actually have on select all</font>

356
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:02,540
these slides up<font color="#E5E5E5"> my statistical to you</font>

357
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:07,239
hey yes i did you know other up ok

358
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,240
forgotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know all the claims</font>

Randy bush

361
00:15:47,130 --> 00:16:01,760
and somewhere there we go

362
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:11,269
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's my first pc</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i thank you all</font>

363
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:14,569
right so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys have probably many of</font>

00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:18,339
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen dewclaws</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before this is the</font>

367
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:31,759
etc the<font color="#E5E5E5"> randy perspective on this is</font>

368
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:35,079
that the sky is falling<font color="#CCCCCC"> but not too fast</font>

369
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:41,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">and proper engineering will hold it up</font>

370
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:45,049
so he was getting frustrated by the

371
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:50,660
rumor mongering was among the IAB and

372
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:57,350
among telco folks circuit is ova being

373
00:16:50,660 --> 00:17:01,129
his name for the the telco rumor back

374
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:04,220
channel or whatever and he wanted to

375
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:09,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">spread some counter disinformation or</font>

376
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:13,699
something so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the same slide you</font>

377
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:16,220
saw before dawn from Jeff Houston has

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:21,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dave copy of the slides of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome Jeff</font>

379
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:24,079
Houston so we had the co-main meeting at

380
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:28,250
the last IETF where there was a lot of

381
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:31,220
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and these slides</font>

382
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,440
are based primarily on work by have for

383
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:41,690

384
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:43,490
their the summary so simple world is you

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,010
have a customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> points default at the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ISP the IC has nice aggregated spaced</font>

387
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:55,760
points it into the rest of the internet

388
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:57,830
as a nice big block unfortunately what's

389
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,750
actually happening is customer multi

390
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,309
homes because the circuits between them

391
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP aren't quite reliable enough</font>

392
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:06,260
because they're not paying enough money

393
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:09,139
and so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> they pay half as much</font>

394
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:12,379
money to twice as many isps the ISPs now

395
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:13,689
have to break out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the announcement as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

traffic from coming in exclusively to

401
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,350
the second dynasty because it's a more

402
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:29,139
specific they have to pass the / 24

403
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:38,009
through also so now instead of one route

404
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:41,889
we have three and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost so</font>

405
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:45,940
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the small multihomer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> such as</font>

408
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:52,269
there's a small smallest net block that

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,970
will be commonly listen to their for

410
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:56,980
that's what people trip out there it's

411
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:02,019
these little guys who are sort of least

412
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:04,779
stable they aren't typically nailing

413
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:08,620
down some cover out so that one's

flapping around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot um problem is</font>

415
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:14,469
getting worse and we need some time to

416
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up with an engineering solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

engineering solutions probably being

418
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,769
some some new routing decision-making

419
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:26,490
algorithm or some new way of passing

420
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:29,289
policy around that doesn't require

421
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,789
really remote locations that enter your

422
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:32,289
policy if you don't care whether they

423
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:34,330
pay attention to your policy because

424
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:42,940
you're looking for a local effect not a

437
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:22,840

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:24,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old ripe allocation boundaries and</font>

439
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,220
what the smallest blocks that were

440
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,559
allocated out of each were

441
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:38,860
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Randy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lifting people</font>

see oh sorry it's extremely hard to see

446
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:05,570
let me see if cursor cursor helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

447
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:10,130
flying along here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's see top</font>

448
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:16,760
snout have 70,000 prefixes if you only

449
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:18,350
look at stuff in the state do you

450
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,840
remember what to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us out yesterday</font>

451
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:31,428
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I'm being clueless up here okay</font>

452
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:36,199

454
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:47,690
the a space only<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we'll take the</font>

456
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:55,909
you add in the beef space got another

457
00:21:50,480 --> 00:22:00,130
line here tops out at 85,000 this is

458
00:21:55,909 --> 00:22:02,750
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the last year over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time see</font>

459
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:06,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">states you really can't see it's in</font>

460
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:09,980
between there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you add in all the</font>

461
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,949
flash 24th that are not historical sees

462
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,659
you wind up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know hundred</font>

463
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:20,090
thousand wraps are a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> over right</font>

464
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:29,090
now so again that's roadmap unfiltered

465
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:35,559
from right ok this is percent growth in

466
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:38,149
the last year so again it's the

467
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:40,160
flashpoint for that one most twenty

468
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,980
percent growth

469
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:49,280
everybody else is down here in the ten

470
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:52,760
to fifteen percent growth and this is

471
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:58,850
how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the space is not covered by</font>

472
00:22:52,760 --> 00:23:00,980
a larger prefix that is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of the</font>

473
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:06,860
blocks out there that are visible are

474
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:14,660
not also within a shorter prefix that is

475
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">also visible and the Seas top out here</font>

476
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:24,140
at about those here point one eight

477
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:26,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much the point</font>

478
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,240
of this basically being if you throw

479
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:31,910
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point one eight percent by</font>

480
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:39,200
accident you're not going to get too

481
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">many complaints I guess okay this is</font>

482
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,550
will net at route views this is

483
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:48,590
basically exactly the same satisfies as

484
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:51,440
we just saw from ripe but looking in the

485
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:54,470
rat views whoa congrats instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive</font>

486
00:23:51,440 --> 00:24:01,940
 blast topping out at 90,000

489
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:14,690
upside down before the the 70,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> 465 on</font>

492
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:27,320
up to 80 it makes a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more sense sorry</font>

493
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:29,990
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it upside down okay same thing</font>

494
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:34,820
with growth most of the growth has been

495
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:38,720
in the / 24 s below that we've got

496
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:44,139
growth and growth in /a /p or sorry a

497
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,140
skilled a BMC space which

498
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,840
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is a lot different than</font>

499
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,580
what rightful saying so if you remember

500
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,149
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right slides we saw about twenty</font>

501
00:24:52,580 --> 00:25:01,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent growth oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in one year here</font>

502
00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:10,010
we've got since 98 we've got three years

503
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:14,360
now let's eat 10 100 okay yeah so three

504
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:19,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">years near doubling over three years in</font>

505
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:22,729
the sea space / slash neck for space

506
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:24,799
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again what portion is uncovered</font>

507
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:28,730
and again we've got a really low

508
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:33,559
percentage there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been growth over</font>

509
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,929
time and the growth over to a landslide

510
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:40,158
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay basically there's a</font>

511
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:44,510
diagonal line which<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts here and goes</font>

512
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:47,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">like so that's the uncovered / 24 or</font>

513
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:50,870
uncovered sees everything else is just

514
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:52,908
kind of meandering along flat but

515
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:58,489
there's diagonal line across here which

516
00:25:52,909 --> 00:26:02,570
is the the multi home of the little / 24

517
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:07,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming and but again the total is</font>

518
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:11,720
not very bad about 0.1 four percent

519
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:14,269
which is disposable if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

520
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,929
way okay so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable and wireless</font>

521
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:19,250
view a<font color="#E5E5E5"> trout views again seeing about</font>

522
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:26,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same thing topping out in about</font>

523
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:31,389
90,000 grabs percent growth about a

524
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,389
doubling over three years again and

525
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,850
almost the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing here is the kind</font>

526
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:43,549
of you know slight<font color="#E5E5E5"> blip but then down</font>

527
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:48,110
again in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phase space the bees</font>

528
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:53,510
are a little higher but again very mild

529
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:54,840
growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see you in this one are</font>

530
00:26:53,510 --> 00:27:00,629
very low

531
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:03,480
then pick up at beginning of 99 and just

532
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:11,270
head straight on up to about again point

533
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:11,270
one four percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> sprint sing same things</font>

534
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:25,800
again here picking up about<font color="#E5E5E5"> October of</font>

535
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:31,050
98 here and heading up to again<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

536
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,940
point one four percent so everybody's

537
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:37,320
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to predict when exactly the</font>

538
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:39,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is going to collapse if we look</font>

539
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">at all of the v4 space being allocated</font>

540
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:45,900
and all of it being advertised as on

541
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:50,880
average / 20s<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million</font>

542
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:52,680
routes if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the allocation rate</font>

543
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,690
not the announcement rate that the

544
00:27:52,680 --> 00:28:03,930
allocation rate which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is faster</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um we</font>

545
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:06,030
get to 2010 and a little while and the

546
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,040
million prefixes that's three doublings

547
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:11,879
and nine years that's well under<font color="#E5E5E5"> Moore's</font>

548
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:16,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">law and then we'd have no problem</font>

549
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we get into space of course so</font>

550
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:22,860
there's the actual allocation rate which

551
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:25,410
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like we are getting a little bit</font>

552
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:29,189
more mellow here in the last few years

553
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:33,810
the beginning of that big growth is 98

554
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:37,710
and it starts smelling that again about

555
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:43,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">four sorry 88 and smelling out again</font>

556
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:47,850
about 94 so fairly very smooth since

557
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:52,139
them if we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the allocations when</font>

558
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:56,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fits that takes about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 20 26 which</font>

559
00:28:52,140 --> 00:29:01,110
really doesn't look too bad again that

560
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,750
was Scott markets<font color="#CCCCCC"> aside from London</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

561
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,669
ipv6 does not solve the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6</font>

562
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:08,400
makes the problem worse because it gives

00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,590
us more<font color="#E5E5E5"> address space space to break up</font>

00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:18,010
in

565
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:20,949
