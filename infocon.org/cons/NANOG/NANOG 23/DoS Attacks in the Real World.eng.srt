to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do here is present analysis attacks</font>

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,260
from our standpoint I know there's quite

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,419
a bit of hatred up there among the

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,490
network operators for IRC servers and

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,050
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you want to try to</font>

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:33,660
put a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in perspective</font>

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,940
I'm a relatively new public speaker so

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:41,300
if I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying or other such things</font>

were seeing very large attacks some of

them have scented up to 40 gig attacks

19

and for the most part the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists</font>

you know the response was<font color="#E5E5E5"> well don't run</font>

routers and such the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,409
we noted is that a week before that

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,060
Angela<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11th they email had gone out and</font>

31
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,369
the servers were infected at the exact

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,900
same vulnerability so there could have

33
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,259
been another weeks warning help somebody

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,610
actually followed up on this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

35
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,070
the first time that attacks that were

later<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to attack things were either</font>

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,639
developed or tested against IRC servers

38
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,669
as a matter of fact the big boss attacks

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,130
every one of the numbers from the

40
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,229
springtime were first used against IRC

41
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:59,009
servers to and for the most part it was

42
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,960
the same sort of thing I plan to discuss

43
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,689
the current breed of attacks at several

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the IRC networks we are seeing are</font>

45
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:12,040
watching I mean

46
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:14,440
good names here and we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

47
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,910
about them from an experienced point of

view a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been up here</font>

49
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,310
and speaking from a research point of

50
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,619
view and we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see big attacks</font>

51
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,959
like a quite a few big attacks against

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:30,640
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanted talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what we have</font>

53
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:32,709
noted<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we've noticed that there are</font>

two<font color="#E5E5E5"> main breed of attacks we are seeing</font>

55

eclectic distributed denial-of-service

times were<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised unix hosts they</font>

59
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,870
send spoof packets and they relatively

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,290
few of them to launch rather large

61
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:57,190
attacks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually you see a relatively</font>

as you can see this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font>

65
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,879
is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Juno it sends a very high</font>

it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at the sibling routers</font>

as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is machines its biggest</font>

71

actually been pretty good at blocking

76
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:40,239
this the new category of the fact that

77
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,549
we're seeing that we think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bigger</font>

78
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,549
problem are based on a large number of

usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows machines these attacks</font>

80

are unscrewed there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of talk</font>

81
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:54,310
out there by various people about how

them in that patch one particular attack

89
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,548
we are seeing is called global threat it

90
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,459
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more than a modified copy of</font>

mirc not

92
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,918
so it runs hidden it is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> capable of</font>

watching just standard ping from the

94

command line the problem with this is

95
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:29,090
it's being spread on IRC to infect

96
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,419
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on IRC and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use to attack</font>

97
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,429
people I or citty so a user will get

98
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,020
online being a novice user will<font color="#CCCCCC"> see an</font>

99
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,580
advertisement for pornography or

100
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,799
something to speed up their internet

101
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,229
connection and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage</font>

102
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,910
or download this and when they run it

103
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:46,219
they too are infected and now they are

104
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,740
out advertising something that's

105
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,470
pornography or something with speed up

internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection and so what we have</font>

107
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,310
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a self-propagating worm this is</font>

a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit different than ones that</font>

actually go out and scan these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are more</font>

social base they depend<font color="#CCCCCC"> on users to not</font>

111
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:06,949
know better and unfortunately we have a

112
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,199
very very high amount of users on

113

<font color="#E5E5E5">relatively fast connections dsl and</font>

114
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,070
cable that don't know any better so

115
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:14,479
maybe we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> require a test or</font>

118
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,620
consider this global threat to be a

119
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:29,599
relatively large threat because it is

120
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,000
self-updating<font color="#CCCCCC"> what won the presentation</font>

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,009

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,330
you can assure<font color="#E5E5E5"> commanding little go</font>

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,219
download a new version itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in</font>

130
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,930

on the computer and fetch any files to

133
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,259
the computer so if a new tool comes out

134
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,799
with a new type of attack it's very easy

135
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:07,159
to update all your drones and get them

136

similar that attacked the f9 IRC server

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,420
and like a chess yung earlier there were

146
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,070
reports that these attacks

147
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,070
could have been up to 40 gigabits

148
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,390
another problem we're seeing is

149
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,800
compromised your<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers there are a</font>

150
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,820
large number of people out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that</font>

151
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,580
will use config- configure Cisco or use

152
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">slowly passwords like Cisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and people</font>

153
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,849
are using these routers to hide their

154
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,500
identities although they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not too</font>

155
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,540
smart because most of them also have

156
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,690
finger open so you can rather easily

157
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,980
find the real IP address and sometimes

158
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,560
they give an able on these and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

159

do they just set it to pain scanning

160
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,070
sizes and it actually generates a rather

161
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,539
high amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic I'm going to turn</font>

relatively successful in getting rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,160
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these attackers on IRC is that we</font>

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,660
can get an insight<font color="#CCCCCC"> into exactly how they</font>

things like bragging in public about

<font color="#CCCCCC">what they're doing yeah motivations for</font>

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,120
these sort of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> texts usually fall</font>

185
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,430

sometimes these people who lose their

carrusel attackers will try to outdo

195
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,890

198
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,320
and finally new<font color="#CCCCCC"> texts are often tested</font>

199
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,270
on IRC servers first because it's a

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,099
convenient place for<font color="#E5E5E5"> attackers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

202
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,620
gives them

their their their tools are affecting

205
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,610
network we have actually had several

206
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,950
cases where we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to track</font>

207
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,690
these attackers and often become

brag about their actions usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they're doing these people</font>

216
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,219
often think that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away with</font>

217
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,720
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing because they think</font>

218

either that nobody's actually going to

try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> track them or some of them might</font>

team that's going to happen to me if I

<font color="#CCCCCC">go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks and servers or maybe</font>

223
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,930
they just really don't realize the other

notifications of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> actions at all I</font>

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,660
attackers because you know not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

much<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or secrets as far as going</font>

229
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,180
after them I actually had some news

else now to move on to the effects of

256
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,260
these attacks general service attacks

257
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,200
can have various effect on the networks

258
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,640
which has the servers that are attacked

259
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,380
smaller pipes can be easily saturated

260
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,900
with traffic and less powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

261
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,430
equipment can run out of CPU to process

262
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,930
the packets which are going through the

263
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,660
router often well before the pipes are

264
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,579
filled with water attacks using these

265
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,550
fastest links and most powerful routers

266
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,459
are prone to being adversely affected by

267
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,069
no service attack as we have seen in

268
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:05,349
other cases attackers may often directly

269
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,360
target the routers and attempt to

270
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,649
disrupt the routing processes and we've

271
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,390
been seeing at some of that lately as

272
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,950

because once you find one what it

usually happens we'll look around at the

good luck at finding them the problem is

443
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,510
how to get rid of them because you're no

444

better off if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan to</font>

there's a different effect like a nap

choosing a different IP address

thing is actually yes there's a couple

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,050
things are there looking at we're still

looking into the net effect indirectly

to safely account number of posts behind

469
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:48,039
varies a great deal by provider you know

470
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:50,830
so somebody may have RFC 1918 address

that may have an effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> on me timing at</font>

they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never actually appear with you</font>

490

someone larger than you and run your IRC

493

actually affect your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

aggregated inside someone else's address
