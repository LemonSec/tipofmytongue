I this is this presentation is adapted

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">from a corporate seminar we give called</font>

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,590
package and photons the emerging to

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,450
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and it's a presentation</font>

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> given before and a few other</font>

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,838
presenters in the companies have given

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,570
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at where we</font>

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,490
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking is going and it's not</font>

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,410
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> event to be a defendant authority of</font>

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,029
saying that things will end up in this

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain place but it's an interesting</font>

12
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspective to see where we've gone so</font>

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,490
far networking where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it's</font>

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,520
happening and how there's gonna be a

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,410
bifurcation of two fundamental layers in

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,570
the network and IP sort of service layer

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,398
and a transport layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the optical</font>

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,840
side and how these layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,620
inter work together I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 50 some</font>

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,789
odd slides in this presentation and

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll probably take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us about an hour</font>

22
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,590
hour and 15 minutes I don't expect it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,059
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the full hour a half but we'll see</font>

24
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,940
these slides are actually on the nana

25
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,379
website as well so they're posted<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

27
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,070
you'll see them we'll look at a history

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,559
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP backbones it won't be a long</font>

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,090
history I know everyone's familiar with

30
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,740
what IP back ones look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and</font>

31
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,630
sort of the emergence of what we call

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,939
the two layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and sort of what</font>

33
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,039
different types of network platforms

34
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,529
will do from an IP services stamping and

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,090
from a transport optical network layer

36
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,680
and standpoint and then what's happening

37
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,299
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit the standards and forms and</font>

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,520
then we'll talk about GM POS or

39
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,549
generalized multi-protocol label

40
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,439
switching<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel free to ask questions</font>

41
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,119
I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise I can answer them since</font>

42
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitching at the last minute but I</font>

43
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,560
will do my best and I have brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,089
couple technical resources with me just

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,790
in case I get some in the late 1980s you

46
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,110
know 1990s I think most of us sort of

47
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,200
understand how these networks have been

48
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,880
have evolved to date we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken our</font>

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,079
data type networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> or IP networks and we</font>

50
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,658
have piggyback them over traditional

51
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,339
boys TDM transport networks there's the

52
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,479
bigger networks were built with Shawne

53
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,829
up wings add drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiplexer eased axes</font>

54
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,439
ATM switches and we've been building

55
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,079
over time IP networks on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,850
that is done well for the most part for

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,690
a while but

58
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,120
it hasn't necessarily evolved to where

59
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,079
we need it to evolve to as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> CIP</font>

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,880
emerging as one of the primary driving

61
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,050
applications in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so the</font>

62
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is why do we have so many</font>

63
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,410
layers well a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons we have so</font>

64
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,970
many layers is they do different

65
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,620
functions and those functions have

66
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,690
evolved over time so we look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

67
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,790
a general standpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> what each component</font>

68
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,100
does our router is doing packet

69
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,410
switching is looking at IP headers it's

70
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,030
doing statistical multiplexing as well

71
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,799
and it can do any to any port

72
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,670
connectivity in any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any connectivity</font>

73
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,590
over an entire network as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

74
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,100
we also do some restoration now whether

75
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,970
the IP layer and also at the MPLS layer

76
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,069
ATM and frame relay switches

77
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,560
traditionally we're great<font color="#CCCCCC"> at hardware</font>

78
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:55,079
courting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in the early days you</font>

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,180
could do a ton C 3 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 c 12 forwarding</font>

80
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,130
lookups<font color="#E5E5E5"> natm hardware but you couldn't</font>

81
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,450
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> them or not n IP routers that's</font>

82
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed I think we all know that's</font>

83
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,380
changed since then you can also do

84
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,690
restoration with soft PVC is converting

85
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,840
over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup pass and rerouting very</font>

86
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,459
quickly lots of the labels and much as a

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,049
lot of seducing speed mismatching and

88
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,430
we'll see how this has changed of the

89
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,709
need for this is becoming<font color="#CCCCCC"> less and less</font>

90
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,000
as the demand<font color="#CCCCCC"> for bandwidth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming</font>

91
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,850
greater and greater and routers

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,680
conservative can satisfy that demand and

93
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,910
then your solid architecture has been is

94
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,620
done the traditional time division

95
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,150
multiplexing to allow us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

96
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,130
different time days and channels in the

97
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,079
network to support these different

98
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,660
applications such as voice video

99
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,310
circulates IP data circuit ATM circuits

100
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,049
etc and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great restoration</font>

101
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,880
sitting inside that layer as well layer

102
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,790
1 and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've seen the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few years</font>

103
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,890
ingrates a DWDM dance halls of the wave

104
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,370
division multiplexing now to put more

105
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,578
and more raw bandwidth into the network

106
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially as we're trying to turn up</font>

107
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:54,600
more fibers across the country<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

108
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,810
across the world now what we've seen is

109
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendors have to do</font>

110
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,450
more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more integration and vendors</font>

111
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">have got a little better at doing this</font>

112
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,810
especially through all the

113
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,920
standardization<font color="#CCCCCC"> bodies but some of the</font>

114
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,269
problems we also have is you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

115
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,950
have integration of multiple network

116
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,110
management systems which at times don't

117
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,429
always work well so you

118
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,740
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of manual integration of the</font>

119
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,480
networks and as we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

120
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,220
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of equipment and lots of</font>

121
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,108
different layers in the network there's

122
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,880
an increase for capital as well as an

123
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,099
operational costs and operational<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font>

124
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">as we all know is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to quantify</font>

125
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,880
but I think we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand that if</font>

126
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have various functional groups</font>

127
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,600
different functional groups operating a

128
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,940
network the costs are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be higher</font>

129
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,190
and higher so where we've seen I

130
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,530
feedback bones<font color="#CCCCCC"> evolved to a little bit</font>

131
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,410
so far we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the muxes become a</font>

132
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,419
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit redundant as trunk bandwidth</font>

133
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,180
has increased so as the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

134
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:47,150
network has gone from OC 12,000 48 to OC

135
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,330
182 and routers can now cross this IP

136
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,460
packets at line rate it's not necessary

137
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,729
that we have a luxe that can groom up an

138
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:59,810
OC 3 or an OC 12 port and put it on to a

139
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:01,700
higher speed port such an OC 192<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

140
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,010
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've seen is sort of a</font>

141
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:07,460
reduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one of the components in</font>

142
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:09,800
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure being the month we've</font>

143
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,979
also seen this happen at the ATM layer

144
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,419
as well early on we had a lot of a lot

145
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,300
of vendors out there a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of carriers</font>

146
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,039
building multi-layer Network swear I'd

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,840
build a solid infrastructure I put an

148
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,060
ATM network across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

149
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,229
then I put an IP network around that and

150
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,080
we'll show some pictures a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

151
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:29,690
later as we now have the capability to

152
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,340
process package at OC 182 speed and we

153
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,580
have some capabilities that ATM switches

154
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:37,609
were originally doing for creating soft

155
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">apat soft PVCs and the restoration of</font>

156
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,120
those we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily need this</font>

157
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,880
layer anymore so now we see next

158
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,180
generation IP networks being built which

159
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,950
is one layer of I p.m. pls and removing

160
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,080
that ATM layer or just by passing that

161
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,599
all together so the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

162
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,430
actually seen some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the some of these</font>

163
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,350
networks ago some of the layers kind of

164
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,970
go away but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a layer</font>

165
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the functionality doesn't always</font>

166
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,590
disappear to sort of migrates into

167
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,180
different components in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font>

168
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,369
one of the questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you have</font>

169
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask is well why why do we remove ATM</font>

170
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,060
in the case of ATM

171
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,940
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for sitting up soft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pvcs</font>

172
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,470
between two endpoints<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but we</font>

173
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,719
managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and put that into</font>

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> MPLS infrastructure but some of the</font>

175
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,410
problems with ATM is we all know about

176
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cell tax problem and you've got</font>

177
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,410
three components with cell tax you've

178
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:30,480
got your you get your five light

179
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:33,570
overhead you've got your al five star al

180
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,010
5m a header information or trailer

181
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,300
information as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you get in</font>

182
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,920
perfect packing so if you're sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

183
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,540
ping packet which is 64 bytes you gotta

184
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,550
use not to sells a lot of additional

185
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,430
overhead so your range of overheads

186
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,170
between 11 and twenty percent on average

187
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,560
so why are we paying that penalty when

188
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,480
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using the benefits of</font>

189
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,120

excuse me one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the next things about</font>

195
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,489
ATM originally to was to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

196
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,440
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of virtual circuits inside an</font>

197
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,240
individual port and across the ATM

198
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,250
switch fabric and we've been able to now

199
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,470
take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same capability and put it in</font>

200
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:20,460
the routers so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily need</font>

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:22,590
this infrastructure anymore so<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

202
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,780
a look at where things are sort of happy

203
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,909
where things are migrating towards and

204
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,059
where we think things will end up in the

205
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,010
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years or so and that is we</font>

206
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,680
believe the infrastructures are going to

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,849
serve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-layer into into two</font>

and we're seeing this migration it's not

216
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,100
going to happen overnight it will happen

217
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:58,080
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and the IP routing layer will</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for things like creating</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons that I think that ATM never</font>

226
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:21,409
caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> on as sort of Han</font>

227
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,880
as a pan world infrastructure is its

228
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:27,720
inability to do any to any connectivity

229
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,610
on a global scale and it's actually

230
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,039
scaled to that nature and what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

231
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,320
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you remember back in the late</font>

232
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,960
in the early 1990s IBM was going to make

233

a 25 megabit Nick<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTM</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick to put in</font>

your and your pc or some workstation and

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,799
we're all going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,520
else in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I think that</font>

238
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't happen because when you start to</font>

239
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,319
create connections through all the

240
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,030
different networking equipment around

241
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,930
the world you have a lot of state to

242
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,790
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> at each one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those equipments</font>

243
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,589
every toilet piece of equipment and

244
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,380
that's too much state and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear you</font>

245
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:04,020
keep the state at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints ok the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP figure out how to rewrite around now</font>

247
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,050
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that connection up and you let</font>

248
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,520
the lower level protocols be able to

249
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,459
figure how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rewrite those packets if</font>

250
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,840
they need to so I think that didn't

251
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,390
that's one reason it didn't scale it's

252
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,580
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why our CP in services</font>

253
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,319
didn't scale either<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok we'll see how we</font>

254
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:26,220
use RSVP in a different capacity later

255
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:28,560
with mpls so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP layer and</font>

256
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,510
you also have sitting below it an IP

257
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,979
transport layer sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optical</font>

258
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,210
transport layer and inside the optical

259
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,640
transport layer we're going to be using

260
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of infrastructure built to date</font>

261
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,230
such as the TDM standardized framing

262
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,790
formats<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do restoration out</font>

263
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,990
the tens of milliseconds and we can

264
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do some restoration at the IP</font>

265
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,090
layer as well with mpls in the tens or

266
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,850
the high tens of milliseconds it has

267
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,500
great serve our ability great it's a

268
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">great use of bandwidth and in fact</font>

269
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,890
especially if you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the DWDM</font>

270
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,270
when you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take us in the car</font>

271
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,189
when you can run 40 different

272
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,410
wavelengths over it that's a fantastic

273
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,450
capability here so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do is</font>

274
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,469
leverage the strengths of one layer and

275
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,450
leverage the strengths of the other

276
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,410
layer and over time we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

277
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:12,810
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little more effectively together</font>

278
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,860
so we'll see I think over time and we're

279
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,689
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see it right now as these</font>

280
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,840
two layers come on board the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer</font>

281
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,460
the transport layer and essentially if

282
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,770
it's done right we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> reduce costs</font>

283
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,450
we'll see reduce complexity as well I

284
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">think in the shorter term we're going to</font>

285
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,160
have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

286
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,930
blech city as we start to migrate these

287
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,329
networks and as the equipment vendors

288
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,500
from all different aspects on the data

289
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,880

290
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,950
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how to make these</font>

291
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">things work together but if we can make</font>

292
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,680
them work together we can have uniform

293
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,170
administration operations and

294
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,270
maintenance which would be fantastic for

295
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,910
everybody even though again I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

296
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,860
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a ways away and when</font>

297
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,510
we look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> signaling one things will be</font>

298
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,520
important to be able to signal from the

299
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,560
IP layer through the optical layer and

300
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,170
we've already got good examples now how

301
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do this with RSVP and LVP and</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda slide keeps coming up here</font>

304
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,980
let's take a quick look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at SONET and SDH</font>

305
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,070
and what it's been able to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us so</font>

306
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,570
far first of all it's been able to set

307
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,220
up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard there's a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

308
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,839
standards in SONET<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the standards are</font>

309
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,480
more or less applicable to the operation

310
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">side but also the framing format side so</font>

311
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,680
we can take 20 c3's and point them

312
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,970
together and pass packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

313
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,949
don't necessarily have all the control

314
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,350
plane standardization would like to have

315
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,300
between different equipment vendors we

316
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,140
also have great restoration so as we're

317
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,219
building these on our rings

318
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,370
bidirectional rings and unidirectional

319
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,170
rings we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to know if we</font>

320
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,089
have a problem on one ring and we have a

321
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,069
cut we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> rewrite traffic it</font>

322
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:43,420
costs us twice as much bandwidth

323
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,610
capacity since we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run these</font>

324
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,250
bi-directional rings but we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> rear out</font>

325
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,209
very quickly in the tens of milliseconds

326
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,160
especially as we start to enable things

327
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,560
like automatic protection switching<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

328
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,020
sean is also great because it allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

329
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,729
to build transparent networks networks

330
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,800
we can run a voice application over

331
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,930
which we've been traditionally doing

332
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,099
until now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can run the data</font>

333
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,260
applications we're going to voice

334
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,120
applications and it's a it's a pan

335
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:10,810
transport layer that supports a lot of

336
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,339
upper layer infrastructure the challenge

337
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,270
we have is to remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

338
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,650
complexity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

339
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,079
interoperability problems and keep a lot

340
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,000
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the benefits so some limitations we</font>

341
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,150
have is it was originally engineered for

342
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,610
voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so one thing to think about</font>

343
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:27,370
is why can't I runs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 5.5 gigabit</font>

344
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:31,180
channel ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's greened up in certain</font>

345
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:34,390
capacities from mostly 133 si si 12 so

346
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,219
c48 etc and it's a great hierarchy but

347
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,530
why is it structured so stiff

348
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,690
and we don't always want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font>

349
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,699
structure in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP infrastructure</font>

350
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,250
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want to have a 5.5</font>

351
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,720
gigabit channel and I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

352
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,190
someone recently said that one reason

353
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we've done was just for simplicity</font>

354
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,140
of the chipset in the sauna equipment

355
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,780
that if they built it that way they can

356
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,330
manufacture quick chipsets very

357
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:01,390
effectively and cost-effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

358
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">inexpensively and with high</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quality so</font>

359
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:06,550
it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting legacy aspect is</font>

360
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,310
been sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> around we have a lot of</font>

361
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,410
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> interfaces at the framing layer but</font>

362
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,569
not necessary the control plane layer so

363
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,480
a lot of networks are built on one

364
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,980
vendors equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

365
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,280
proprietary control plane that's sitting

366
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,440
between it I think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> pee in routing has</font>

367
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,490
taken a sort of a little bit ahead of

368
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,690
that and since that we have

369
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,370
interoperability between different

370
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,900
vendors equipment at a control plane

371
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,840
layer so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of bring that</font>

372
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,100
now to the optical world and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

373
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,650
problem we have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

374
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,560
visibility if you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the package side</font>

375
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,550
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ATM switch or an IP router</font>

376
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">into what's happening in the optical</font>

topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> the optical domain to a router</font>

379
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:51,190
is just a clear pipe from San Francisco

380
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:53,140
to New York I may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an MPLS LSP and</font>

381
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,710
it may go over a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

382
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,840
taxes adms sonnet equipment and then

383
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,040
DWDM equipment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we have no idea it's</font>

384
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,810
a whole different group that organizes

385
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,260
that and controls that and brings that

386
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,260
up and run

387
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:11,449
so want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at trying to find</font>

388
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:14,269
what is a router and what sort of at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

389
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:16,128
optical side that sits underneath the

390
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,050
router and it's important because we

391
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:19,550
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the concept that some</font>

392
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,378
people start talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optical</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">really possible it's important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to define</font>

also need to have inside of that enough

buffering to do we called the late

408

<font color="#CCCCCC">think one of one of the things that IP</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">what do I do with this infrastructure</font>

479
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,090
and how do I offer a similar type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,429
service to my customer which was very

484
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,580
generation architecture so we see as

485
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,950
routers now migrating to the role of

486
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,418
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer services so you need</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the granularity in a router to</font>

488
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:52,990
look at the different types of package

489
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,360
coming in especially we look at a

the customer into the router and am i

496
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,000
doing things like multipath so we're

497
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,070
seeing router is actually taking on the

498
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,610
next generation service capabilities to

499
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:20,629

501
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,490
if we bridge over to the optical domain

502
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,600
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking people there's a</font>

503
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,160
couple different components they're

504
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,230
saying they're inside the optical main

505
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,640
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is an optical cross connect</font>

506
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,140
there's two types is an optical

507
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,660
electrical optical cross connect which

508
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,150
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually taking optical</font>

509
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,920
feed into this cross connect that I'm

510
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,299
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convert it into electrons I'm</font>

511
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,070
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some processing out and I'm</font>

512
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:46,870
going to convert it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to optical</font>

513
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:49,490
so I may be taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an OC 3 ATM</font>

514
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,320
interface converting it not electrical

515
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:55,070
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back out to a different</font>

516
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,879
port with an ATM interface as well so

517
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,139
the important thing is we're actually

518
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,370
converting<font color="#E5E5E5"> two electrons this</font>

519
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,190
technology's been around for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font>

520
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:04,520
well we've seen come online the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

521
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:06,350
years are all optical cross connects so

522
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,330
no electrical components inside of it so

523
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,770
we're not converting I shouldn't say no

524
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,840
let's go components we're not converting

525
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:15,740
optical packets to electrons and then

526
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,510
back out again so what dishes use for in

527
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,059
many cases the ability to take different

528
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">lambdas or different light forms into</font>

529
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:25,100
the router off of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> court keeping them</font>

530
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:26,960
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> waveform and then migrate them</font>

531
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,270
out to another port and so we need to go

532
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,410
from any port to any other port inside

533
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,410
this optical cross connect

534
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,950
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aqua prospect what allows</font>

535
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,350

537
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,699
necessarily allow us to look inside of

538
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,370
that lambda to see all the different

539
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:51,730
packets of the IP packets or ATM cells

540
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:53,350
or started framing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go to add</font>

541
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,200
and drop different lambdas we ought to

542
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring a lambda in drop it or switch it</font>

543
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,100
off to another circuit you typically

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is done a very very high bandwidth</font>

551
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,280
and I by no means an expert in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> men's Mike micro electrical</font>

553
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,960

554
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,679
do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually offer one port bring in</font>

bounce it off at tilting mirror and

557
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,930
these mirrors are actually controlled by

558
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,060
little motors that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in the</font>

563
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,080
then back out another port this is

564
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,580
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat technology but again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font>

565
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,570
important is that you're actually only

566
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,580
taking a whole lambda when you do this

567
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,470
currently the matrix that duties are

568
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,710
about eight by eight matrices<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

569
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,000
they're not incredibly incredibly dense

570
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,400
right now the number reports that they

571
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,190
offer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the long-term goals to sort of</font>

get to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1024 optical cross connect</font>

574
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,490
one of the issues that you'll see is

575
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,620
that amend and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

576
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,020
technology is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the switching speed</font>

577
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:20,409
is relatively slow it's on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> order of</font>

578
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 to 25 milliseconds as compared to a</font>

579
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,700
router which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at IP packet and</font>

580
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,250
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing switching in the nanoseconds</font>

581
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,920
range<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what these tend to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

582
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,470
better for is to actually establish a

583
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,810
connection from one port to another for

584
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,670
lambda and both switching all the

585
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,500
transfer all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the all the information off</font>

586
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,570
that light in one poured out to another

587
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,220
in keeping that connection up they're

588
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,639
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily meant for</font>

589
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,260
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to switch very quickly the</font>

590
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,450
other type of technology being used is

591
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,429
liquid crystal light valves which is the

592
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,860
same technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically that's inside</font>

593
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:56,049
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your LCD displays and what allows you</font>

594
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,729
to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a light a light wave in</font>

595
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:59,830
and put it through a polarizing

596
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,240
beamsplitter and you actually split it

597
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,370
in two halves and you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take one</font>

598
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,400
half and run it<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a little crystal</font>

599
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:09,039
cell and you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn it on or</font>

600
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,750
off and as you we as you realign those

601
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,809
ways through another polarizer dreams

602
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:16,690
are you can switch the actual lambda

603
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:20,559
form to different ports<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok again the</font>

604
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,940
problem with this is it's not it's done

605
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,610
if this sort of millisecond

606
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,350
sub-millisecond ranges but it's not done

607
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,959
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the low 90 second ranges which you're</font>

608
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,408
used to in sort of routers as well as

609
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,870
again the granularity is looking just at

610
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:36,610
the light of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pure lambda no</font>

611
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,590
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually invented by</font>

612
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Agilent comes from bubble jet printers</font>

00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:46,690
technology in what<font color="#CCCCCC"> way and that what</font>

615
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,340
agile ends up doing is actually heating

616
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,169
an index<font color="#E5E5E5"> masking fluid inside of a</font>

00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:56,350
temperature<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then based on how much</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">characteristics of that actual bubble</font>

621
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,189
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually move the light into a</font>

622
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain direction the challenge here is</font>

623
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that bubble in a</font>

624
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,418
consistent state and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Agilent claims that</font>

625
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:12,429
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to keep that for long</font>

626
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:14,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">periods at times but you're switching</font>

627
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:16,539
times are sort of in that 10 millisecond

628
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,820
range again I don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

629
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:21,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually been deployed any commercial</font>

630
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:25,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">grade products at the moment</font>

631
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:27,509
so one of the things we heard a while

632
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:28,439
back I figured what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company was</font>

633
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">where there's a press release had</font>

634
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,029
somebody built an all-ip an all-optical

635
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,279
IP router and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that they were</font>

636
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:36,929
leveraging terms from the IP domain

637
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,230
which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EPI world which is very hot</font>

638
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:42,539
technology and optical technology which

639
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,549
is again a very hot area and saying we

640
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,929
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optical router okay and they're</font>

641
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:47,999
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying we have an optical</font>

642
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:50,820
transport switching device like an old

643
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:53,669
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but as you sort of look at</font>

644
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,678
well the concept of taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a whole</font>

645
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:57,509
lambda and not converting it to

646
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,269
electrons but saying we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

647
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:02,190
this whole land in and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read an IP</font>

648
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:04,230
header inside of that or an MPLS header

649
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,480
and switch it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there are some</font>

650
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,519
definite challenges to doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

651
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,809
one approach of their working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

652
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:11,399
labs is what's called the pipeline

653
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:14,460
approach where you split the waveform in

654
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:16,229
half<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and you actually take one half</font>

655
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it and you convert it to electrical</font>

656
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,549
and you look at the IPO sorry so one is

657
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,489
the curriculum<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one is you</font>

658
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:25,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually look inside this waveform at</font>

659
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:27,659
the IP information and then you send a

660
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,059
signal to how the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> side of the</font>

661
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,139
waveform should actually be switched and

662
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:34,590
I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've done some of this in</font>

663
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:36,689
the lab but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult and</font>

664
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,418
it's very slow at the moment it can

665
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,489
again compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to IP routers so the</font>

666
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:43,679
challenges there is that in the writing

667
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:46,379
rule we're used to buffering packets and

668
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,789
well how do you buffer light<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one</font>

669
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:51,570
thought is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually can sort of you</font>

670
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:54,029
know fix and a photon in sort of a an

671
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,450
orbit and keep it there for a certain

672
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:59,429
period of time so I personally think

673
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,799
we're a long long way from being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

674
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:05,509
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an all-optical router they can do</font>

675
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,509
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

676
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,190
if we go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this concept of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a two</font>

677
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:15,559
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and we believe that</font>

678
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:18,470
we sort of have an infrastructure of IP

679
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:20,299
mpls packet oriented devices and we have

680
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,789
another infrastructure of optical

681
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:25,240
devices without their<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEO devices are</font>

682
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:27,440
all devices make sure optical devices

683
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,320
what's going to mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see is how</font>

684
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,440
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to build networks over time</font>

685
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,120
with this technology and there's two

686
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,039
general approaches seem to be happening

687
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,379
one is sort of an overlay model on one

688
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,710
as a peer model in the overlay model

689
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,690
we're looking to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have IP</font>

690
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,940
routers at the edge of these networks

691
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,320
and inside you have a pure optical

692
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,260
network and we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this for a</font>

693
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,789
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time there's nothing new here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

694
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">the router becomes a client of the</font>

695
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:56,090
optical domain and rather can't

696
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:59,149
necessarily see inside the optical

697
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,500
loving so the problems we see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

698
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:02,479
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of stress when you</font>

699
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,529
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on the protocol side and this</font>

700
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">should look pretty familiar you can</font>

701
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:09,380
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about IP routers on the outside</font>

702
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:10,850
and ATM network on the inside and one of

703
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,090
the problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that architecture is</font>

704
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:15,889
that you have these routers on the

705
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,570
outside and in some cases you build

706
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:19,699
networks where you had a full mesh of

707
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,918
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> router had a PVC to every</font>

708
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,450
other router and network so the ATM

709
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,159
devices had to scale to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

710
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">them to you don't have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

711
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,419
PVCs to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but a bigger</font>

712
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,350
problem was that if you're a router and

713
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:32,450
you have a connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have your other</font>

714
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,070
router you've got an N squared mesh<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

715
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,309
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and you've got this router</font>

716
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,840
has to keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the ITP</font>

717
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:41,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">information and that's a lot of stress</font>

718
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,309
and the things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP mesh size med</font>

719
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,830
scripts were made to sort of try to

720
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,779
solve some of that problem so one

721
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,309
question we have to ask is if we look at

722
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:51,110
an overlay model do we want to do that

723
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:53,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">again does it make sense to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learning</font>

724
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:57,229
lessons from overlay network models of

725
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:59,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past and can we now apply them I can</font>

726
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,549
build<font color="#CCCCCC"> next-generation networks in the</font>

727
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,049
peer model we're looking at building a

728
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:05,750
network infrastructure that has an

729
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:07,730
integrated control plane so the routers

730
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,860
of the IP services can communicate with

731
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> optical devices and they can share</font>

732
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,428
protocol information and control plant

733
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:14,080
information and the routers can

734
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:16,299
understand

735
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,100
what the infrastructure looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

736
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:19,779
the optical layer and they can make some

737
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,889
intelligent decisions on how they're

738
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:29,320
going to set up pass through their

739
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:31,090
network another sort of approach this to

740
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,820
sort of mix the two to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to have</font>

741
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:36,570
in some cases a pure pure based<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

742
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:39,309
another case is sort of a hybrid network

743
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,870
mixing the best of both worlds and a lot

744
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:43,269
of we want to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

745
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:49,178
uni interface now in many cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

746
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:50,169
router world into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the optical world so</font>

747
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:54,159
few things have been happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

748
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:57,610
standards bodies one in the oif in a

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">nine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1998 so the standards body has</font>

750
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,510
started looking at developing a union

751
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,340
based signaling model so think about

752
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,750
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the in the frame</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

753
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,029
union based in the frame<font color="#E5E5E5"> really uni or</font>

754
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,429
an ATM uni near the network user to

755
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:10,809
network interface and they were working

756
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:12,429
with the IDF to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of look at how do</font>

757
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:14,668
we leverage all the work we've done

758
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:19,059
inside the MPLS working groups and

759
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:24,700
taking LDPC LBP and RSVP and using that

760
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:26,529
as a signaling protocol another and as

761
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,090
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as what's happening the ITF as much</font>

762
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:30,760
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work has been done</font>

763
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,620
a generalized mpls working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

764
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,720
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> this concept of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-protocol</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lamba switching and generalizing it and</font>

766
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,470
have a few more slides on this a little

767
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:42,340
bit later to look at building this pier

768
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:45,519
and hybrid model now alternatively ahead

769
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:49,299
of myself here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

770
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ITF and this is sort of a new slide</font>

771
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:52,149
than we saw all apologize here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

772
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,820
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of us apparently is moving</font>

773
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:58,209
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> com control and measurement plane</font>

774
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,730
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of original work was to extend</font>

775
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,700
ospf and is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure you can get</font>

776
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:05,409
all the attributes of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network in</font>

777
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,510
this we've done already with mpls and

778
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,610
extending<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sighs and ospf and now do</font>

779
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that from a broader perspective how do</font>

780
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">we now open this up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to include all sorts</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different circuit types and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> link</font>

782
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,399
types and we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the futures</font>

783
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,740
now with bgp so how we how do we connect

784
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,918
across autonomous systems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we</font>

785
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,279
do carry or carry applications and

786
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,279
network

787
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:39,050
in the sense of building these units

788
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:41,010
from the oif we're looking to do is run

789
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:43,530
applications now so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font>

790
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:46,950
signal from the router across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Uni</font>

791
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:48,690
and ask for services but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

792
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,520
information that's kept inside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

794
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:56,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

795
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,380
bridge from today's networks which don't

796
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,930
really talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the optical</font>

layer the<font color="#E5E5E5"> octavia clear to an interface</font>

798
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,770
now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll talk over a unique</font>

799
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:07,050
standard to eventually looking at a way

800
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,160
to rebuild an integrated model will

801
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:10,889
generalize multi-protocol label

802
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,170
switching but we can have all optical

803
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,490
paths being created<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the network and</font>

804
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:17,060
we can have routers looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

805
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:19,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">obstacle has to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the most</font>

806
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:22,190
advantageous wait to build something

807
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,190
question

808
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:47,700
I don't think so the question is why is

809
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:52,549
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> union model is proposed to be better</font>

810
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">than gfs model will be over around worse</font>

811
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:06,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the I guess what I'm</font>

812
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to articulate is it I think the</font>

813
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:10,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">end point we'll get to is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will have</font>

814
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:12,990
an integrated model will have optical

815
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:14,758
devices talking to IP devices

816
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">overgeneralize Norfolk protocol label</font>

817
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,700
switching and so the IP devices can

818
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:22,860
understand more the more of the topology

819
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,149
information i have a few slides coming

820
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,360
up on this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think one of the</font>

821
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:30,149
reasons why is that if I'm rotters on

822
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,678
either end and I can see an optical path

823
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:34,168
through the middle it's already been set

824
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,470
up I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use that as</font>

825
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:39,779
opposed to if I'm two routers from San

826
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:42,000
Francisco to New York and I have to call

827
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,710
my optical group and say can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you set up</font>

828
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,059
a path and that takes more weeks to set

829
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,059
up hit your network

830
00:31:48,159 --> 00:32:05,299
that thing goes up top I'll be given at

831
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:07,520
the goddess with<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the wiser I can't</font>

832
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:09,700
answer that so but I think it's a good

833
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,700
point

834
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:24,070
whereas mpls been mpls was sort of

835
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:26,010
derived<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its early stages to solve</font>

836
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:29,320
from the traffic engineering problems

837
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,820
and we took a lot of lessons we learned

838
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,639
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of building ATM networks with</font>

839
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:36,520

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,439
so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is try to take some of</font>

865
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,880
the technology that we built in 10 pls

866
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,940
so far and we've leveraged off

867
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,580
applications like ATM and now generalize

868
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:48,120
it in can pls so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this and</font>

869
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:51,240
build optical networks that talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to IP</font>

870
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:55,309
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so now we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

871
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:58,080
do is take TDM type infrastructure and

872
00:33:55,309 --> 00:34:04,830
physical port type switching in sort of

873
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:08,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">build an integrated peer model some of</font>

00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:10,350
the applications some of the tensions

875
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,730
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on is really a now</font>

876
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:17,118
extend the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp both ospf ni zai us into</font>

877
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:20,730
the optical domain so there's a common

878
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">standards-based I GP that runs both at</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router world inside the optical</font>

880
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,520

881
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,219
different levels of hierarchy and take a

00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at why because you have different</font>

883
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:32,819

00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,799
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video you get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GM layer into</font>

885
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,149
the sonnet layer and etc we're going to

886
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,490
go to control those different type of

887
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:39,839
applications and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leverage we</font>

889
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,350
constraint based routing that some of

890
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,149
the lessons we took out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HM world</font>

891
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:47,690
and brought into mpls and now extend

892
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,690
that even further

893
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:56,860
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at extending the effort of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp one sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is if we can</font>

now flood the information for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

896
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,940
different types of links that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font>

897
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:06,400
used to having<font color="#E5E5E5"> before what we did we</font>

898
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,320
went from the ATM roll to IPS we took

899
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,030
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what type of link is it</font>

900
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,550
and how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth well now we need</font>

901
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,080
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also take to extend the</font>

902
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,940
different types link is it a packet link

903
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,310
which we're used to was a service or a

904
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,870
cell ATM type of packet or an IP type of

905
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:22,390
packet but now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different links</font>

906
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:24,190
such as TDM and lambda links and fiber

907
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:26,589
links as well as a concept called

908
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:29,790
affording adjacency<font color="#CCCCCC"> an affording</font>

909
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:32,290
adjacency up from the head of<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself one</font>

910
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:33,910
in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to take different</font>

911
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:37,270
and thick extensions that we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

912
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:40,240
so far which is things like having new

913
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:42,160
sub tlv such as link type and so what

914
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,930
type of link is a working link or

915
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,910
protection link so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we see a working</font>

916
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,460
link or down and protection<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elaine come</font>

917
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,660
up we cannot signal that through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

918
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,790
so everyone else understands it now

919
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:56,440
we're on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different link as the primary</font>

920
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:58,450
length another type of sub tlv we have

921
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a shared link group so share risk</font>

922
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:04,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Linkwood says we actually bundle links</font>

923
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,830
together we might sort of do take three

924
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,050
links and actually bond them together

925
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:10,810
and if one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those links has a problem</font>

926
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:12,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">we want to be able to send a message out</font>

927
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,230
via the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITP to everyone else in the</font>

928
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:16,509
network that says look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this link</font>

929
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:20,950
actually has a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you might not</font>

930
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:23,200
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it affording adjacency is a</font>

931
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:25,299
really interesting concept in that what

932
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,419
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show is that if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set</font>

933
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:30,790
up a lambda LSP from one optical device

934
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,920
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a drop multiplexer into this</font>

935
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,200
sent through different optical

936
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,360
components or in this case maybe it's a

937
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,120
dense layer division multiplexing device

938
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,890
to another end device remember to do now

939
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:45,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">is now take the supporting adjacency and</font>

940
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:47,650
advertise it back into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp okay as a</font>

941
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">40</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adjacency at let's say in this case</font>

942
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:53,620
at a lambda level if it's a 48 agency at

943
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:56,950
a lambda level then the routers can now

944
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,420
see that there's a path from an optical

945
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:00,460
device that say in San Francisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

946
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,770
another device in

947
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">New York and now what they can do is say</font>

948
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:07,660
well since I<font color="#E5E5E5"> already see that adjacency</font>

949
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,520
at the optical they're all I need to do

950
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,440
is signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> not through that adjacency and</font>

951
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,259
say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to actually now set up my</font>

952
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,260
packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> base LSP through this adjacency</font>

953
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,430
some of the attributes will need to look

954
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,070
at is one of the traffic engineering

955
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,990
metrics I mean how is this packet being

956
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,640
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was this LSP being engineered both</font>

957
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,990
of the optical layer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping the</font>

958
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,819
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> instrument engineer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

959
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,470
about that as well as at the packet

960
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,839
based layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that goes with it</font>

961
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:40,259
actually the lspita actually tunnels

962
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,259
through that

963
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,910
in addition inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> a GM pls we're also</font>

964
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,279
doing is setting up different

965
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:52,190
hierarchies so we might have bundles

966
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that look at the fiber</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bundles so as we</font>

967
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,240
have a conduit that runs from different

968
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">City pairs we can actually identify that</font>

969
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,689
and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different fiber conduits</font>

970
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,880
that went through that as well as the

971
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,610
TDM network with runs across those as

972
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,930
well as any packets that run across

973
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:08,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">packet-based LSPs that run across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

974
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:09,589
so there's different hierarchies that we

975
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,150
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep track of it as important</font>

976
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:14,000
because we can now when we advertise in

977
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:16,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp we can identify what hierarchy</font>

978
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,870
this is part of so the different devices

979
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,790
who are concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

980
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,859
hierarchies can understand what layer to

981
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:23,990
look at and so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> also device will look</font>

982
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,220
at maybe a TDM type hierarchy but it

983
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,629
will ignore any the packet based

984
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:31,129
information because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not important</font>

985
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:34,160
to at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point in time all the lessons</font>

986
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:38,510
we learned in side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of building</font>

987
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:42,020
constraint based routing in mpls devices

988
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:43,370
we can now apply in a general case to

989
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,650
generalize multi-protocol label

990
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:47,330
switching so as we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at extending the</font>

991
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">igp to take a listening information in</font>

992
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:51,710
and we look at now trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compute</font>

993
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:53,150
pass through the network based on those

constraints<font color="#E5E5E5"> as traffic engineers</font>

995
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,770
constraints we can run this algorithm

996
00:38:55,070 --> 00:39:00,380
that sort of spits out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best explicit</font>

00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:09,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">bates LSP as well as some sort of mating</font>

1055
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,660
seen that's being handled by a different

layer on there that sits below us but as

1057
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:40,020
we sort of connect optical devices we

1058
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,460
need the ability to now understand what

1059
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,530
different types of links were actually

00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:03,900
so if we take now a bundle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> land does</font>

in case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> failure we can now</font>

1080
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,349
recognize that both of those links are

down

1082
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,980
so one of them the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mackerel benefits</font>

1083
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,529
were looking for inside of GM pls is to

1084
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,760
sort of create more open standards the

1085
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,530

open standards the optical world isn't

1087
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,700
necessarily used to having those open

1088
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:02,250

1089
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:06,569
standards and to eliminate the need to

00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:08,370
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> N squared meshing problems so that</font>

00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:17,850
create n<font color="#E5E5E5"> N squared or n times n minus 1</font>

at the protocol level for these if we

1098
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,210
can leverage a lot of the experience

1099
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:31,080
inside the traffic engineering world we

1100
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:33,900
can hopefully build new next-generation

1101
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,279
networks so if we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bridge from</font>

lot of that experience that we've seen

1105
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,920
inside of the overlay Network and

1106
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,260
collapsing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an integrated network</font>

from the IP and ehm world into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP</font>

1109
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,870
we'll see it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

1110
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,490
routers are the largest consumers of

00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:58,770

00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:00,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">consumers of bandwidth and have taken</font>

1113
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:03,690
over that role from the voice equipment

1114
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:06,360
and as that's happening I think one of

1115
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:08,220
the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> points here is we need to sort</font>

00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,368
GM pls is that if you can signal from a

router through an optical domain to

1140

another router and if you can only touch

1141
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,328
one router and that can talk to

1142
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,770
everything else along the path then you

1143
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:27,299
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have separate management</font>

1144
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,240
systems talk to everything along the way

1145
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:33,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with your point</font>

1146
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,368
about sonnet overhead there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1147
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,740
much overhead inside of us on a path and

1148
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:39,630
I actually think as these networks we

1149
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,720
evolved will keep standard sonic framing

1150
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:44,309
because it works and there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1151
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,618
good operations and administration and

1152
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:48,000
maintenance inside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hitting the</font>

1153
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:51,710
section line of path overhead that we

1154
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,710
use to keep those lines up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ring</font>
