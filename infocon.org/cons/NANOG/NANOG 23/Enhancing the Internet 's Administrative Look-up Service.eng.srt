1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,298
so as Susan mentioned I'm mark Hasse

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,219
person to my left is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Newton and</font>

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,700
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about a new project</font>

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,610
that we are working on I'd met<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to</font>

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,279
my cell phone turns it goes on long here

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,890
and like to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little bit</font>

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:25,859
about a lookup service proposal that we

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:29,400
are working on so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is called</font>

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:33,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Universal who is and what this has come</font>

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:36,920
from was that a other year ago verisign

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">was under negotiations with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can and</font>

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,020
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the portions of the agreement was</font>

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,769
talking about critical infrastructure

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,850
and that verisign was going to MIT it's

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,190
at least pages are certain amount of

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,660
money towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet infrastructure i</font>

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,649
believe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 million</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars</font>

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,328
and one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this was actually</font>

19
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,760
working on a a concept they called

20
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,180
universal who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and that's the project</font>

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,729
that we've been tasked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with helping</font>

22
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,680
formulate so how are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it well</font>

23
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,570
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're doing is</font>

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,330
we're having three public consultations

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:19,320
where these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are open anyone who wants to</font>

26
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:24,000
show up and it's mainly for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy</font>

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,110
people we had excuse me we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">business of intellectual property</font>

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,320
holders in august two thousand at the US

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,470
Department of Commerce there's going to

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,360
be another section session that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

32
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,500
to I believe they'll be held at ICANN

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,570
meeting in LA and I believe this<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,729
november 15th in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> evening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this has</font>

35
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,559
not been fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet because i can't</font>

36
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,158
addenda hasn't been formally published

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,960
yet and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for those that</font>

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,420
timing to actually come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out so we can</font>

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,389
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our meetings don't</font>

40
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,850
conflict with anyone elses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

41
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,530
there's going to be another public

42
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,199
consultation with the civil liberties

43
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,759
groups and other nongovernmental

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,829
organizations and that's probably

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening sometime at the end of</font>

46
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,769
november probably in DC so informal

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:18,179
meetings well

48
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,250
presented at right we're here<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,650
going to give a short talk at<font color="#CCCCCC"> aarons</font>

50
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,420
meeting next week and we may be speaking

51
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:30,570
it out apricot in March so so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

52
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,369
this thing well its first of all week we

53
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,680
anticipate envisioned it to be non

54
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,420
centralized we also don't see it being

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,930
specific to any particular TLD registry

56
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,700
so it fears hopefully will be somewhat

57
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,430
mitigated and this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a verisign</font>

58
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,780
sort of centric sort of thing and we

59
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,600
also see this thing as being

60
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,770
non-proprietary opening standards and so

61
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:59,130
on as an outcome so what's our role here

62
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,260
well we're helping coordinate this we're

63
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">committed to actually have have this</font>

64
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,260
happen and we're here kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

65
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:09,930
listening mode since we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

66
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:13,019
requirement safe so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a</font>

67
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:17,100
part of a bigger picture since who is is

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:21,140
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really old very simple protocol</font>

69
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,640
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very much broken and</font>

70
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,320
people have seen this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past and</font>

71
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,958
there's been a number of efforts<font color="#CCCCCC"> staff</font>

72
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,690
occurred when was our who is another one

73
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,430
is who is plus plus and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list goes on</font>

74
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and none of these have really taken off</font>

75
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,950
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the years and it kind of died for a</font>

76
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,600
while and now has really come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

77
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,750
there was a birds of feather session at

78
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last ITF called who is six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where a</font>

79
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,430
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these so-called requirements</font>

80
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,870
were started to be formulated<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms</font>

81
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,430
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Huckle refix who lives and there</font>

82
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,290
hasn't been after the meetings there

83
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,080
wasn't very much activity so it's been

84
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,590
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little email traffic on it there's</font>

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:05,160
a internet there's another a bunch of

86
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:09,090
email list was I Jeff dash who is at imc

87
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,150
org<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one that's</font>

88
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,040
dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> non who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has specific for</font>

89
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,209
issues but dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with who is like data</font>

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:22,019
that we called IETF dash not<font color="#E5E5E5"> 43 that's</font>

91
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,720
actually held by us and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

92
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is as people start going down this</font>

93
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,789
line of looking

94
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,460
who is in the requirement they may

95
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:32,349
realize may or may not realize the east

96
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,688
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the requirement that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who is not</font>

97
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:39,669
really appropriate for the task anymore

98
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:43,419
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no inherent navigation</font>

99
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:44,680
capabilities and for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font>

100
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:46,688
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago this was not a big deal since</font>

101
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,919
everyone went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one site I mean there</font>

102
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:53,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DD n nick and that since more</font>

103
00:04:50,919 --> 00:05:00,490
thought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ddm next and AP</font>

104
00:04:53,979 --> 00:05:03,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nick the BDN Nick and I and also is a AP</font>

105
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,650
nick has caught on and now with all

106
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:07,449
these new emerging<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds is actually</font>

107
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,179
going to get to become a more<font color="#E5E5E5"> math as</font>

108
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:13,210
well as the emerging internet regional

109
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,180
internet registries that are also for

110
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,979
those to come online<font color="#E5E5E5"> so pretty soonest</font>

111
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,620
thing is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a really big mess</font>

112
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:24,460
so it's time now to start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

113
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,830
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fixing it so there's other</font>

114
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,229
issues and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing with policy and</font>

115
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,330
political sorts of things and that's

116
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,800
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> not our role here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

117
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,229
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the technical</font>

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirements perspective and try to</font>

119
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:40,419
build something<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there so but that</font>

120
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:48,219
much to say I'm give the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

121
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:50,289
talk to Andy good morning so traveling

122
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:53,469
down the road of who is might not be the

123
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:55,750
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing or its division we started</font>

124
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:59,440
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at other things to explore and</font>

125
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,509
so we've come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> two two projects</font>

126
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,099
the first one we call the referral ldap

127
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:05,259
service which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is based on ldap and it</font>

128
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:08,080
takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of the the ldap standard</font>

129
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:11,110
and a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> one we call X app which is</font>

130
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,089
an approach to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML layering very</font>

131
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,139
similar to what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EPP approaches in</font>

132
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:18,610
the IETF proper group realistically both

133
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,250
of these projects actually started

134
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:25,569
before verisign<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sonya the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appendix w</font>

135
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,550
agreements that I can so the goals of

136
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,349
these projects we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to reinvent</font>

137
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,080
too much front of you use as much

138
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:33,069
technology as possible which<font color="#CCCCCC"> means we</font>

139
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,409
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to try to invent another</font>

140
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:36,849
application transport and we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

141
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:38,319
to try to invent another<font color="#E5E5E5"> schema language</font>

142
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:39,500
this is territory that's been covered

143
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,910
plenty in the past

144
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,760
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no reason for us to recover</font>

145
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,620
it again we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> want structured queries</font>

146
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,620
inspector results for better machine

147
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,350
readability so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can write easily</font>

148
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,090
write programs against these mechanisms

149
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,560
referral the bridge to bridge the domain

150
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,659
registries and registrar so right now

151
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,030
you have a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people trying to find</font>

152
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,320
domains and they go to the registry and

153
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,190
then they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to a registrar to</font>

154
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,390
track down the contacts client

155
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,350
authentication to address privacy

156
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:10,610
concerns and I should stress here that

157
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,290
we are only<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to provide the</font>

158
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,600
mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the policy as far as</font>

159
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,540
privacy and client authentication go and

160
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,330
then I said a toolkit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can</font>

161
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:24,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">easily write programs against these of</font>

162
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:26,900
these services so the referral ldap

163
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:30,650
servers uses all that serve up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main</font>

164
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,479
information we use ldap so there's many

165
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,200
many server implementations you can

166
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,610
there's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 and there</font>

167
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,300
are many many tools and tool kit so you

168
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:44,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">can write client software to use our</font>

implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> or our pilot projects we</font>

172
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,330
anything like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all</font>

173
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:56,300
everything we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is already defined in</font>

174
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:59,450
RFC or an internet draft somewhere works

175
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,160
with all that v2 and v3 and here's the

00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,090
against the servers and it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> often tell</font>

180
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,729
how to find the actual ldap servers

181
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,520
themselves and we also outlined the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dis</font>

182
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:19,159
structure of how we did this in a graph

which has been submitted the IHS<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft</font>

00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,409
we have done so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far with the referral</font>

186
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,839
all that service is that we have

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:36,200
registry ldap server has four discs for

188
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">commnet oregon edu and it did four name</font>

189
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,339
servers and we currently have over

190
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,070
thirty two million domains in there we

191
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,990
have a registrar disc also has the force

192
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,720
that same<font color="#CCCCCC"> for disc as a different name</font>

193
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,060
servers and contact has referrals to

194
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,500
registrant's and we have demonstration

195
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,040
of access control there to show that

196
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,690
show how

197
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,779
you can use client authentication for

198
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,699
privacy concerns we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> website as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:21,599
people along to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> users openldap</font>

208
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,870
we open source the codes to that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

209
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,290
client code samples and we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

213
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:40,560
project still<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently in draft form so</font>

214
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,750
it means we haven't written a much code

215
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,660
beyond the time to verify that our

216
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,720
thoughts are correct the idea there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

217
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,689
used layering layering approach and not

218
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,690
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign-ups in fact too much similar</font>

219
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">gpp in how we're approaching it where we</font>

220
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,769
use XML namespaces for the extensibility

221
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,060
an XML schema for the definition so

222
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,819
we're not creating a new schema language

223
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,649
and we're also going to monitor the

224
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:06,000
proper working group out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the IETF and</font>

225
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:07,199
see if we can reuse some their object

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,260
class<font color="#CCCCCC"> because some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of their their</font>

227
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:12,540
objects and their definitions again it's

228
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,860
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML layers the you have a</font>

229
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,810
common scheme before talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

230
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,970
commands and authentications referrals

231
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,079
entity references so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

232
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,329
there are information specifically

233
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:24,300
specific layers for refining the queries

234
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,888
and the result<font color="#CCCCCC"> set and the goal there</font>

235
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,319
again is the application transport

236
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:32,360
agnostic so far we layered on top of

237
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:35,670
soap or beef or whatever you want

238
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,399
currently we concentrated on domains as

239
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,130
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we deal with mostly but we</font>

240
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,399
are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start looking into how you</font>

241
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,720
do with our<font color="#CCCCCC"> IR and ir uses and whether</font>

242
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,149
it's even appropriate for us to look

243
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,269
there we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be looking at</font>

244
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:54,120
commons indexing for for sharing indexes

245
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:59,120
among different servers and also more

246
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:02,600
requirements gathering so that is a bit

247
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">there any question</font>

248
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:27,980
about the coverage comment I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say</font>

249
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,939
right now would be a good idea to look

250
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:34,220
at this coverage document and see what

251
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:35,899
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make of them right now we're</font>

252
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,939
good good spot right now for comments

253
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,759
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would sleep we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use we didn't</font>

254
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:42,679
poverty help you guys do your job<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

255
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,360
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I monitor the mailing list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

256
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,550
average all the time and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

257
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,959
reading the draft so if you think if you

258
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,819
think it's in a pretty good stable at a

259
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:51,199
stable point then I guess now would be

260
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:55,219
the time from you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> did objects in</font>

261
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:57,559
there is there any plans to integrate

262
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,420
look up for the various integers but the

263
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:06,139
registries<font color="#CCCCCC"> allocate United p addresses</font>

264
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:08,809
and they SS as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldap is concerned</font>

265
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,100
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Erics hall who's</font>

266
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:14,809
actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to release a dress pretty</font>

267
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,759
soon on how to define KS numbers and IP

268
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:19,999
addresses currently if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

269
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:22,610
rfcs on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're the sin taxes</font>

270
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:24,410
aren't very good about how they describe

271
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,689
the actual when I be addressed looks

272
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,160
like and so he's working on this to try

273
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,509
to solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem and try to solve</font>

274
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,399
some of the query semantics that go

275
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:35,209
along with them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not a good</font>

276
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:38,959
role goal to integrate this data well

277
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:43,429
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not our data so actually I what is</font>

278
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,529
that it is somewhat of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a secondary goal</font>

279
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,179
for us to actually take that the

280
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,009
registry data and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in as well</font>

281
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:51,319
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the reasons why we're</font>

282
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:54,949
talking at right naper cot and also add

283
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:58,189
air because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> says it's really a</font>

284
00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:00,740
protocol that all of us used by accident

285
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:03,049
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> history right so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

286
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,309
