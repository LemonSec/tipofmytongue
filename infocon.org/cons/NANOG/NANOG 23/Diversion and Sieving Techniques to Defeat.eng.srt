00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,109
okay good afternoon we've seen several

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,690
talks talking about the status of their

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,840
different divas attacks and this talk i

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,660
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to present you with the</font>

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,369
architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a methodology to defeat</font>

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,340
eatos attack and something we believe

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet was employed to protect</font>

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:50,940
discuss what are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of a oops</font>

with animation doesn't work something

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:59,120
wrong but the presentation what went

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong</font>

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay then i'll simply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meant one with the</font>

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">transparencies we've seen in the</font>

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,960
tutorial yesterday and some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talks</font>

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,150
today some approaches to defeat be dos

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,220
attacks will we use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router of</font>

22
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:24,320
different routers features such as the

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:27,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">HCL rate limited and the most effective</font>

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:33,080
one is to route the victims traffic to

25
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:36,020
null 0 all of these methods they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,150
solve the good packets together with the

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,070
packed bed package so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we saw</font>

28
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:45,080
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the lunch and approach will</font>

29
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:47,660
you send all kind of BGP reject and

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did you help the</font>

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:53,300
attackers because as soon as you start

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,850
the attack you disconnect the server of

33
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,640
the target<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the attack actually the</font>

34
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:02,179
attacker just need to make the noise as

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,300
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is attacking and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boom the target dose</font>

36
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,350
of the internet so that's the main

37
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,788
problem with those approaches and other

38
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,820
problem is that routers don't always

39
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:15,920
have the necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpu power to handle</font>

40
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:20,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these techniques window heavily</font>

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,730
loaded with a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic so another</font>

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,340
approach you could think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is to be the</font>

43
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,760
special device knowing how that knows

44
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,280
how to fill out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bed package from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipe stream and leave the good package</font>

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,870
going through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> employees at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> edge</font>

47
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:43,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">right before the victim or the potential</font>

48
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,860
victims obviously Andros has been in and

49
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,900
I've already over a year before the

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,300
talks by Steve<font color="#CCCCCC"> delevingne and others</font>

51
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,480
this approach won't walk because it's

52
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:57,020
too close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the target and say in this</font>

53
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">case if with a 500 megabit attack the</font>

54
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,280
line going just into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom hotel is</font>

55
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,680
choked and even if you have a

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">supercomputer in front of the target it</font>

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,630
won't be able to solve the problem the

58
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,950
strongest computer the world won't help

59
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:15,349
you over here in addition such a

60
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,329
solution is not economical you need to

61
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,549
deploy

62
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:24,550
equipment for each additional potential

63
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:26,350
victim which is non scalable so going

64
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the recommendations of Steve and</font>

65
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,640
others we move upstream going towards

66
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,700
the sources of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack and with the</font>

67
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,940
toys such a solution on the backbone

68
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">link this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will believe have</font>

69
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,010
some problems because the device you

70
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,900
know deploy needs to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very strong</font>

71
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:50,079
device it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle OC 48 oz in 192</font>

72
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,940

73
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">computational power of the device is</font>

74
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,870
divided between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good package and the</font>

75
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,880
bed package and the non victim traffic

76
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,420
and victims<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic so you don't get the</font>

77
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,310
full attention to the victim and it

78
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time before I convince</font>

79
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:09,720
any of you to put a new device in on

80
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,900
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> backbone on the critical path so</font>

81
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:16,899
what we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what essentially we are</font>

82
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,269
trying to advocate you is to deploy such

83
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,570
a device that knows how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> distinguish</font>

84
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,090
between dead packets and good packets

85
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:29,550
next to strategic hotels in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

86
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:32,260
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that once victim is</font>

87
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,380
attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that is under</font>

88
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,659
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> to divert</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the packets whose</font>

89
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,419
destination IP addresses victim and only

90
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,270
those packets through the device have

91
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,250
the device clean the traffic and place

92
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,520
the legitimate traffic or what

93
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,820
supposedly is legitimate traffic back on

94
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:55,390
its<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes to the intended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> destination</font>

95
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,659
that's the general suggestion that we

96
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:01,659
are advocating as you can see we don't

97
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:05,740
add the device on the critical path this

98
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,600
solution lets<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routers route we need</font>

99
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,430
some help to do the diversion but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,540
don't ask the router to do the filtering

101
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,970
we don't use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACL and you can place</font>

102
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,919
the solution as upstream within the

103
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,350

<font color="#E5E5E5">edge as you can push it</font>

107

servers whatever is routable in your

114

115
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:52,058
that you don't need to prepare anything

116
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:53,919
extra before you can protect a new

117
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:55,809
server you don't need to make all kinds

118

of reservations and installations to

121
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,209
to deploy the solution would be to put

<font color="#CCCCCC">these special devices washing machines</font>

you're peeling hotels all you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

when there is an attack activate the

131
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,709
survive the attack so that the basic

132
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:39,179
principle<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to deserve the traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

136
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:52,599
is activated of course by a detection

138
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,529
so much right now because we believe

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,959
detection and protection or two

140
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:00,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">different mechanisms that should be</font>

00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:05,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">vidoes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so quite a few detection</font>

00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:18,188
to the mission control of the network

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:29,649
of bed and they will activate the

153
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,320
rather than black holdings of taking all

154
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:39,720
the traffic into a

155
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,480
call is to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> their all the victim</font>

victim<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to provide the service</font>

162
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:02,040
the washing machine itself consists of

163
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,200
several different lines of defense of

164
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,510
civil different algorithms inside the

165
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,110
box that know how to distinguish between

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:12,900
the bed<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet and the good package and</font>

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:16,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">so out the dead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packets obviously have</font>

170
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,710
and you have all kind of statistical

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,640
methods<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on the traffic after it</font>

00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:41,460
block those flows that has been detected

178
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,640
divergence so the diversion really

179
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,469
consists of two steps one step is to

180
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,960
grab the traffic bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to your</font>

181
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">washing machine and the second step is</font>

182
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,140
put the clink traffic back on the

183
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,570
network on in on its way to the

184
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,430
destination and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the key issue</font>

185
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,590
without looping you don't want the

186
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,390
traffic too busy diverted and entering

187
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,780
an infinite loop between the router and

188
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:16,890
the washing machine that's the problem

189
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:20,760
we are facing that way to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with so</font>

190
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:23,220
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one simple approach to to do</font>

191
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,700
the divergent in case you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> loyal</font>

192
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,550
to device attached to your hotel which

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the typical case in data centers and</font>

194
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:36,089
some other switching office ourselves

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> place you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use bgp announcements from</font>

197
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,400
the washing machine to the router to

198
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:48,180
divert the traffic on the other space

199
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,750
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is under attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ET / 32 / / 51 /</font>

200
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,959
30 whatever

201
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:56,680
being attacked we do those announcements

202
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,600
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> no export and no advertise</font>

203
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,930
communities think so the announcement

204
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't go any further but the this hotel</font>

205
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:08,109
and to return<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic on its way to</font>

206
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,510
the destination this machine the washing

208
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:16,780
putting traffic back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> its next hop</font>

209
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:19,660
layers the next layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

210
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,689
out to the destination so the traffic

211
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:26,260
doesn't even get back to the original

212
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:29,680
value that's a simple method<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works</font>

213
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,630
very nice if you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font>

214
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,109
device next to you out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there here is</font>

215
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,510
another simple method to achieve this

216
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:41,050
diversion which is essentially it was

217
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">done already was presented in 9 of 19 in</font>

219
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,260
they dealt with the popular content with

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:56,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">GPS before to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> divert the traffic but now</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> open a channel to the next all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

possible next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hops so this washing</font>

224
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,110
machine is again acting like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tall tale</font>

225
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,150
but now routes over the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot panel</font>

226
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,680
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually two hopes one hope from</font>

227
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,680
the washing machine to the hotel and

228
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:16,209
then between those two hotels towards

229
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:19,120
the destination notice also that because

230
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,280
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we do the whole scheme the</font>

231
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,280
tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> only carries traffic in one</font>

232
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,790
direction so the bottom hotel only needs

233
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,010
to do d capsulation it doesn't do any

234
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:33,329
encapsulation and the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

235
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:36,100
to spend on doing this d capsulation is

236
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,560
actually less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of floaty</font>

237
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,500
would have if all the data traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

238
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,650
just pass through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> also you just in</font>

239
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,050
a win-win<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation in any event we</font>

240
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,630
notice that doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> D capsulation</font>

241
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,479
increases the cpu load on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers</font>

242
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:56,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've tested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by its most twenty percent</font>

243
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,520
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> chatted up to 200,000 packets per</font>

00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,520
second

245
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:07,589
so we actually done several different

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">tests one of the tests we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">attack health and the client to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> others</font>

248
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,790
and to serve well one of them being

249
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:19,170
victimized and the other one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a non</font>

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:22,079
victim and safety with three<font color="#E5E5E5"> phases for</font>

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,930
this test normal traffic with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> green</font>

252
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,890
lines we saw a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago an attack</font>

253
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:31,739
period and then we activated the

254
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:36,390
diversion and we see the results of the

255
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:40,100
hill so the x axis is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> y</font>

between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Baskervilles periods of</font>

additional hundred and fifty or so

288
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,339
transparent caching so you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

289
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,910
cash machine instead of the washing

290
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:21,800
machine transparently a talking to the

291
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,370
router and asking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> author by vet all</font>

292
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:29,359
port 80 traffic to me the cash was

293
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:31,550
handling the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP content and returning</font>

294
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,830
the traffic either to the client or to

297
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's exactly what we want to do for</font>

298
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:45,560
protecting against videos and actually

299
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,620
this what I decide was the first version

300
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">of wccp version 2 of wccp actually</font>

301
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,420
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the version of different</font>

302
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,550
flows on different parameters you could

303
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,680
ask to the traffic from certain

304
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:02,390
destinations or certain instances of

305
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,339
other parameters of the flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can</font>

306
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:07,430
also do the mobile version you could ask

307
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:11,120
a remote router they get the traffic to

308
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:14,000
the cash machine / of washing machine

309
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,880
and return the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol</font>

between the washing machine of the cash

312
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,069
machine and the router notice the wccp

313
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,920
is not a configuration you have to

314
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:30,980
configure the router to be ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

WCCT and then to activate and deactivate

316
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:38,510
it's a matter of a protocol the main

317
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,939
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that it's available only</font>

than routing it according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the routing</font>

parent link and say traffic who's this

342
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:49,429
nation versus victim send the traffic

343
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:51,439
over here when the traffic comes back

344
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:53,539
from the washing machine it will use the

345
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:56,539
routing tables which will go on the

348
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:04,069
another way another approach to do the

349
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:06,799
same to use a policy based routing of

350
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:08,599
air filter base forwarding would be to

351
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,519
employ it on the interface card

352
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:13,849
connected to the washing machine when

353
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:17,689
you do it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way only the traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

354
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:19,730
was intended to the victim and only the

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,409
legitimate traffic is going through the

356
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,799
policy they're starting processing

357
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:27,679
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this positive does require some</font>

through the policy based routing

processing as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned before it</font>

requires dynamic configuration to

activate or deactivate and access list

turns out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different accessories so</font>

that you can enumerate and just that you

can give the names

everything is being deserted not only

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay last division method that we are</font>

390
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:05,090
playing with is actually by using double

393
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:13,190
deserve an attic as before with midget

394
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:15,590
the announcement now to send the traffic

back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the victim you give the victim a</font>

to block this IP address on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,409
the big fan and in some configurations

407
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:55,519
to use the management of the different

408
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:58,519
IP addresses you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can employ not to do</font>

409
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,289
the translation from the IP address you

410
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:02,389
used from the washing machine and he'll

414
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,950
another feature that can be worked out

415
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:17,720
with this architecture is reverse

416
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,820
protection you could use this system

417
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,450
depending on the digestion message you

418
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:25,668
are using to protect somebody's as

419
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:29,869
victims from being attacked by your

420
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:31,429
customers so your neighboring<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP calls</font>

421
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:35,049
you up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and says hey you guys you are</font>

422
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:38,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">sucking my client you could divert</font>

423
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:41,029

425
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:46,320
and only let the legitimate traffic

426
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:48,960
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the client and cleaning out</font>

427
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,830
they are part of it so that's what we

428
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,559
call reverse protection it really

429
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:58,379
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the diversion</font>

430
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:00,720
and another something which is very

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:04,830
works very nicely with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our architecture</font>

give him services from those web caches

for to the popular subsets of servers so

summarize the approach that we have

shown your heel we believe using this

449
00:21:54,899 --> 00:22:00,649
architecture you could actually keep the

routing to null 0 / sync holding them
