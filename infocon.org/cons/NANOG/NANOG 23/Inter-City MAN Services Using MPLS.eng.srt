1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,500
okay well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll keep this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of sweet</font>

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,219
because I know I'm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that's</font>

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,280
getting in the way between your break so

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:17,009
this discussion is actually about

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,689
hierarchal services through a land back

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,430
though on a packet backbone which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,500
a network service provider and what this

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,420
enables is why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet</font>

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">man's it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily have to be</font>

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,650
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet it's for any upstream to</font>

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,690
downstream kind of service where the

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,059
upstream provides a hierarchal kind of

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,440
scheme of mpls services to the

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,059
downstream end which allows the

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,370
downstream than to use that upstream for

16
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">both transit services as well as</font>

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,828
hierarchal and fill up services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,600
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relationship to eat the demands</font>

19
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,510
because biggest problem we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,870
now in the ethernet in man's special

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,108
Ethernet is this ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a</font>

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,870
backbone<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> define so the problem</font>

23
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,090
we got in in Ethernet services or

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,960
downstream is trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to multiple</font>

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,760
cities is basically how you deliver

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,030
economical services between cities and

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,360
so the first problem you get is do you

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">operate your own land network global</font>

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,900
network whatever you call any<font color="#CCCCCC"> metro</font>

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,310
network and try to make all I'd operate

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,770
and being a green feel that you've much

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,530
more tougher and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

33
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,509
complex and costly the other alternative

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is to just go by traditional</font>

35
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,210
private line services like lambdas<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATM</font>

36
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">sonnet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is a possibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

37
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,380
the problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

38
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,850
of complexity involved it's an overlay

39
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,860
model and as you'll see the problem with

40
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">any of the traditional telecom services</font>

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,720
its<font color="#E5E5E5"> distance sensitive so if I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

42
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,430
operate and drop off cities all over

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,670
North America and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then finding Europe</font>

44
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,009
and Asia it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot to</font>

45
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,360
deploy this on any traditional telco

46
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,619
circuit so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next kind of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,259
want to do is you want look at this or

48
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,200
say well what can I do well the first

49
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,389
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the IP backbone they're</font>

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">great because their distance insensitive</font>

51
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,369
so the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if I can get an IP</font>

52
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,890
fabric to do

53
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,299
the lots of capacity and gives me a good

54
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,250
kind of quality of service or service

55
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:25,340
and its distance insensitive i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

56
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,840
paying for the price of how i plug into

57
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,180
that backbone and use that backbone

58
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,400
which is kind of nice the other one is

59
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,220
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can push the complexity of</font>

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,790
operating a global<font color="#CCCCCC"> land backbone to nsp</font>

61
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:40,099
partners by using some schemes i'll talk

62
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:47,000
about it also reduces my cost of

63
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:48,410
operational costs also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this we</font>

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,629
want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever services</font>

65
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,549
we do within the city looks the same to

66
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,349
other cities and there's no real

67
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:58,430
restrictions of going within the city or

68
00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:00,140
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> city and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

69
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,409
won't make sure we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> deliver some SLA</font>

70
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,809
is between within the city to other

71
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:07,730
cities using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp backbone and long</font>

72
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,500
lectures there's some certain SLA

73
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,238
characteristics that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service looks</font>

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,750
the same whether it's in the city or

75
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">across two different cities so the first</font>

76
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:20,660
question is we could certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> use an IP</font>

77
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:24,380
backbone and use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example various</font>

78
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:27,829
coloring techniques ipsec GRE also a

79
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:32,450
martini kind of tunnel we can also use a

80
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:33,829
3ds l2vpn kind of a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

81
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,690
certainly will work which<font color="#CCCCCC"> means we get</font>

82
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:38,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the access to the IP backbone and we get</font>

83
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,489
VPNs on it but the problem we get then

84
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,650
is there's an operational costs that's

85
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:44,449
the old lens for a problem right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

86
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,090
have three cities<font color="#CCCCCC"> i bring in the fort</font>

87
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:49,190
city and i have to provision the border

88
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,220
routers and every one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i tell a</font>

89
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:55,069
man's or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethernet man's like I prevents</font>

90
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,489
provision them with Louis<font color="#E5E5E5"> Freeh kind of</font>

91
00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:01,040
topology information so what happens is

92
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:05,449
I'm still running a virtual backbone and

93
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,750
so what I'm presenting in there is the

94
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:11,209
ability of doing something similar like

95
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,549
an get use the packet backbone but<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

96
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,840
through appearing model just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 2547</font>

97
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,260
so what I'm really presenting is

98
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,880
appearing model 2547<font color="#CCCCCC"> kerikeri</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extensions</font>

99
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,529
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to trick you late</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

100
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,770
little better than section 9 of the drop

101
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,869
so in the other Lane model you can see

102
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,909
you get an 80

103
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,430
kind of problem of meshes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

104
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,949
or the operators up this man has to kind

105
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of worried about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it every border which</font>

106
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:38,139
is an issue when you're out when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you run</font>

107
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,210
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 39 city and go to the 50th so</font>

108
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,850
what we try to do is the peering model

109
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,638
2547 or vpr ends where it offers is

110
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:48,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disappearing concept</font>

111
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,620
where the network the extreme networks

112
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,360
looks like a big gigantic router so in

113
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,840
this case we have three cities and

114
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,740
everything the port city the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp just</font>

115
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,780
kind of advertises that port city and

116
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,840
all the other cities get<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to that</font>

117
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,210
and that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be coming online and</font>

118
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,820
there's no configuration changes so this

119
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">is very powerful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that as I roll out new</font>

120
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,219
cities and use the up streams backbone

121
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,380
it looks as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension to my service</font>

122
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,949
extension to my services and I don't

123
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:24,490
have to go modify any of these these

124
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:27,130
where the routers are between the demand

125
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,130
provider the downstream and upstream and

126
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:33,760
as other thing you can look at in the

127
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:36,490
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the LSP is going to</font>

128
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,750
these lands I really managed and

129
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,180
operated by the upstream they're

130
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,180
actually as the city comes on why it

131
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,680
actually just shows up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

132
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,900
other cities as you can see it's not

133
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,060
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the man provider has to</font>

134
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,388
provision on Oliver's border routers so

135
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,250
how do we do this is the question so

136
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,260
what we get is this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of model where</font>

137
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,599
everything is just you know opaque to

138
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the to the man provider and it</font>

139
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:04,599
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> superior</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship so the first</font>

140
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">part is in the peering model what we get</font>

141
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,620
is we get an MSP that runs his

142
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,510
traditional network as a packet based

143
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">network probably right you know learning</font>

144
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,909
mpls and he offers this<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner-city man</font>

147
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,530

153
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:45,139
tana me so what the mall looks like is

154
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,109
this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get in the blue is the</font>

00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:51,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">nsp the blue LSP has its own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

158
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,850
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next one above that is what we</font>

call the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter CD LSP now this LSP is</font>

161
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:10,190

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">off this man provider so in this case</font>

163
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,969
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Terry was a man provider and</font>

164
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,669
we have city<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and see two men one and</font>

166
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,859

167
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,889
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> intercity LSP to all the other</font>

168
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,090
cities in automated fashion this means i

169
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:27,650
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a provision anything and</font>

170
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,179
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is automated and this is</font>

171
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,969
highly important since because at the

172
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,190
alt functions<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have all my phones going</font>

173
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that for my transit services all my</font>

174
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,780
other city in tricity traffic that any

175
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,850
operator mistakes can be devastating so

176
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,260
there's an operational issue on when I

177
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,560
can do this if I didn't have this kind

178
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:48,010
of model now once we like somehow we

179
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,500
automate this function<font color="#CCCCCC"> where this</font>

180
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:54,620
intercity<font color="#E5E5E5"> LSP they FA like kinda LSP is</font>

181
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,139
done then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> land provider or</font>

182
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,180
downstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have free access to put</font>

183
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:02,360
as many LSPs as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

184
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,810
or send IP traffic on it so what we get

185
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,580
now is the effects of a VPN and a

186
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,530
transit kind of service peering kind of

187
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,690
service for red traditional IP are in

188
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,179
the same interface and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hierarchical</font>

189
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,130
nature and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important thing is</font>

190
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,949
that second LSP there you call<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner</font>

191
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:22,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">city LSP SF they like it actually forms</font>

192
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:25,039
the adjacency between c1 and c2 not at

193
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,979
p1 and p2 and that's very important

194
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,990
because all state information and all

195
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:32,240
adjacent seats for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp mlsp state</font>

196
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:35,260
information is not on the PE providers

197
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,729
box which means he can support you know

198
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,669
hundreds and thousands of down streams

199
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,130
and not having comes with scaling issues

200
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,870
so when I presented this presentation

201
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,110
about in July to the Metro Ethernet

202
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:51,800
forum i also had yak off work with me on

203
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,040
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he helped me refine this and we</font>

204
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,410
can

205
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,779
up with this idea of exactly how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

206
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,939
this so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to the</font>

207
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,620
exact of details how to do this we also

208
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,149
important is to get the cost of service

209
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,459
mappings from all the higher service

210
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:06,829
LSPs down all the way through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inner</font>

211
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,899
city LSP and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the traffic</font>

212
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:11,329
engineer LSP so that maintains the class

213
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">of service and we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know do this just</font>

214
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:17,630
exp<font color="#E5E5E5"> marketing's and toss them down so</font>

215
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,920
the proposal is to join RFC 2547 this

216
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,930
which was well defined on a carrier to

217
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">enterprise relationship and very loosely</font>

218
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,910
defined on how to do carry two carrier

219
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,430
relationships and I think 2547 is a

220
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:34,130
great model is for exactly this 24-carat

221
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,349
a carrier and the reason is the routing

222
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,870
tables from an enterprise you know

223
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,480
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not what I call aggregated and</font>

224
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:44,060
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of admission of any routes we</font>

225
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,949
pointed back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp to figure out</font>

226
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,989
you know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which means the</font>

227
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:50,359
horrendous operational issue on a

228
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,519
carrier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrier model the downstream</font>

229
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,220
is really highly aggregated routes so it

230
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:58,310
fits in really well so what I'm

231
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:01,430
proposing yours you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> RSC 3107 which</font>

232
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,469
is bgp mpls and you mix it with 2547 you

233
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,290
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly what i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> described above</font>

234
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,959
so how it works is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I'll go</font>

235
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">into actual details and again you have</font>

236
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,829
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp in blue and the man providers in</font>

237
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,620
yellow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> represents two different</font>

238
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:21,260
cities so the first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

239
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:23,360
is you get is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp would</font>

240
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,630
probably create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a traffic and engineered</font>

241
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,279
link between p1 and p2 and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

242
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,560
important that<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy does it through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lvp</font>

243
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,079
or RSVP he have to create a traffic

244
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,589
engineer link or some kind of tunnel or

245
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:39,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">between p1 and p2 part of the 2547</font>

246
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,600
bispak and that allows a reach ability

247
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,160
from my GP point of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> between p1 p2</font>

248
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,730
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i won't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in this</font>

249
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,829
back so basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp just deployed</font>

250
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,259
2547 on this network in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of</font>

251
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:53,420
his network and the next thing that

252
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:59,170
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you created the adjacent</font>

253
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:02,810
using the p1 and p2 the ce-1<font color="#CCCCCC"> asbr</font>

254
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:05,660
announces prefix one so in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

255
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,989
man<font color="#CCCCCC"> one announces prefix one but instead</font>

256
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,839
of

257
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,690
in just prefix one bgp he also announces

258
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:15,170
an MPLS label now instead of running

259
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:18,190
just giving any label you can use an

260
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,870
implicit label and put the no label and

261
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:25,700
that implicit no label then gets mapped

262
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:28,670
to with the prefix the p1 takes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

263
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefix and the label and he attends to</font>

264
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:35,510
it a route<font color="#CCCCCC"> roughs distinguisher so that</font>

265
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:38,029
it's now recognized as a VPN ipv4 route

266
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:41,600
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he assigns a route target which</font>

267
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:46,630
gives it the vpm membership and the bgp

268
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,520
next hop becomes pu.1 and the label<font color="#E5E5E5"> l</font>

269
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,980
will no label is now assigned label<font color="#E5E5E5"> l</font>

270
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,529
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used for egress targeted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font>

271
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,060
on the way back which will see that

272
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:57,529
thing gets announced all the way through

273
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,609
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> network all those other networks and</font>

274
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:04,490
finally gets the PE to where City and

275
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:10,220
number two is and what happens then<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

276
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:14,839
p2 announces that reachability

284
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:38,029
what you now get is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue on the top</font>

285
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:43,010
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got an LSP that has been formed</font>

286
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:46,490
that's being created by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this interaction</font>

287
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,170
of bgp mpls and 2547 and what this

288
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,180
happens now is you've got control

289
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,979
information flowing between the man

290
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,459
provider and appearing model to the

291
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:58,640
upstream back to a man provider and you

292
00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:01,069
get a hierarchy on the top flow and then

293
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,779
you can put anything into this and what

294
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,089
happens is when you put like regular IP

295
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:08,300
traffic it into it you pop<font color="#CCCCCC"> you push in</font>

296
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:12,470
regular IP pushing label<font color="#E5E5E5"> ke ke gets now</font>

297
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,870
treemap 2l @ p you want a te too Elvin

298
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,060
looks and says okay I<font color="#CCCCCC"> got it got a p1</font>

299
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,550
from my beach p next top resolve to<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

300
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:24,260
push on<font color="#E5E5E5"> label swap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font>

301
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:28,849
swap<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets the p1 p1 pops it again I pops</font>

302
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,230
que el sorry and then finally he<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

303
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the packet and there's an old label</font>

304
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,880
packet and he pops it out to see one and

305
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,570
the packet flows so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had a</font>

306
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:42,079
regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP packet for an LSP to go</font>

307
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:45,290
across this is a cross between<font color="#E5E5E5"> man 1 and</font>

308
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">2 and LSP like an RSVP would be stand</font>

309
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,430
for example a path message and this what

310
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,760
happens is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important that the</font>

311
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:56,089
past message the the hop<font color="#CCCCCC"> object gets</font>

312
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,010
pushed with the IP address of ce2 as the

313
00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:00,200
input of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tunnel so what has to</font>

314
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,140
happen is this hierarchical LSP has to

315
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,660
behave like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> fa like Ford adjacency</font>

316
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:09,140
like characteristics it has to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

317
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the key hops is set correctly for</font>

318
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,860
our SB to work and this could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used</font>

319
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,050
for LD PRS<font color="#CCCCCC"> routine what happens</font>

320
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,120
eventually is you get an inverted tree

321
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,219
happening from all the multi points to

322
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,870
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the data flow that the</font>

323
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,269
direction of the data flow which means

324
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can pass hierarchal services or</font>

325
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:28,399
just IP services over it and if you then

326
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it bidirectionally you get this kind</font>

327
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:36,560
of multi-point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> root a tree so you get</font>

328
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,480
c 1 c 3 2 c 2 and so on and you and then

329
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,189
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get is an inverted tree that's</font>

330
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,240
bi-directional nature and it will

331
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:46,310
deliver you hierarchal services so the

332
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,839
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved is how do you get this</font>

333
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,300
class<font color="#CCCCCC"> of service model which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font>

334
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">about to give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> n to n signaling for a</font>

335
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,920
clap for call emission controls to get a

336
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,510
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> qsr model and to date no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

337
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,279
speak and deliver a jitter service or

338
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,079
guarantees and jitters so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

339
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,770
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues that still need to be worked</font>

340
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:07,040
on this proposal is being submitted into

341
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,350
the IETF the next month for myself yeah

342
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,230
cough and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it probably nine or ten other</font>

343
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:15,589
authors which is still getting kind of

344
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,300
finalized so I hope they've really got

345
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:22,240
that's kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little complicated and</font>

346
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,240
confusing but angles any questions

347
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,100
okay thanks
