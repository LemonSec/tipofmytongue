1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,350
and since he's got to hook up<font color="#E5E5E5"> his laptop</font>

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I could tell you a story about him too</font>

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:12,000
actually I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell any of</font>

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,950
the good one but I did have a quote of

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,049
Ross's and maybe he doesn't remember

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,448
this but back when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf proceedings</font>

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,990
were actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Xeroxes because people use</font>

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,300
transparencies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I was doing a CL MP</font>

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,778
talk because I got stuck doing OS I

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,359
don't ever get stuck doing OSI I got now

11
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,149
and neither's Ross I asked him<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,040
could borrow some of his slides to used

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,920
in a presentation he told me not to hide

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,829
my eyes but to plagiarize<font color="#CCCCCC"> I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,960
always stuck with me anyway I think Russ

16
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:47,500
is almost ready and he's going to talk

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,890
about best practices or ISP security

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,890
and get it

19
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,840
oh good the slides just appeared online

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,239
so if you need to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> them if you want</font>

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see them then hit reload thanks</font>

22
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:05,220
thank you I do sort of remember saying

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,200
that about plagiarizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I do sort of</font>

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,850
think that at least in the ITF it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,430
be nice if there was more attribution

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,820
given than plagiarizing is done but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,810
did attribute it so you did right so I'm

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Henrik best</font>

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,820
practices for is peace security and I

30
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,940
will explain what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Enric is I'm going to</font>

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">start off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with an overview of what is</font>

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,229
the network reliability and

33
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,759
interoperability<font color="#CCCCCC"> Council I think this</font>

34
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,649
slide is the only time when i'll tell

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,390
you what Enric actually stands for but

36
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,430
i'll talk about where it came from and

37
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,800
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to talk about the best</font>

38
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,780
practices<font color="#CCCCCC"> for security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked a little</font>

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,820
bit about where Enric the best practices

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,530
came from and then talk briefly at the

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,479
end about next steps so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Enric</font>

42
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,149
Enric is a Federal Advisory Committee

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,360
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is chartered by the FCC Federal</font>

44
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,660
Communication

45
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,990
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enric exists because of the charter</font>

46
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,479
from the government however Enric really

47
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,580
is not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> government agency hour ago it's</font>

48
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a government group if you look at</font>

49
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who participate in Enric most</font>

50
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,660
of them are service providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font>

51
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">majority of service providers you know</font>

52
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,829
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest block is vendors so</font>

53
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,910
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> service providers and vendors is</font>

54
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:22,600
the overwhelming ill set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

55
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,850
participating<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this in the early 90s</font>

56
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,609
there was a series of major service

57
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:30,220
outages in the telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> circuits</font>

58
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">which network and you know several</font>

59
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,209
members of Congress went to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FCC and</font>

60
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,720
said what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you going to do about this</font>

61
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:39,160
and so the FCC chartered<font color="#E5E5E5"> Enric</font>

62
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,940
originally is the network reliability

63
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Council to work on figuring out how to</font>

64
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,840
make the existing telephone and circus

65
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,150
which network more reliable Enric has

66
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,709
been chartered<font color="#E5E5E5"> insert</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two year blocks or</font>

67
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first block you know did two years</font>

68
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,730
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it got recharter for two more</font>

69
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,760
years and so on and gradually the scope

70
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,859
has increased a little bit to consider

71
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,940
looking at things like data networks and

72
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,220
and wireless networks and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> enric</font>

73
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,609
for many years has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been developing best</font>

74
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,140
practices to promote network reliability

75
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,420
initially network reliability for the

76
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">traditional telephony and certain switch</font>

77
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network and then more recently and rick</font>

78
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,870
has come up with best practices for

79
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,429
network reliability and for

80
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,000
interoperability in data networks as

81
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,530
well

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,540
the most recent chartering of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enric is</font>

83
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">Enric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 they like Roman numerals</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

84
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,950
personally don't happen like no Roman

85
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,079
numerals but somebody else does so the

86
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,950
various incarnations are given in Roman

87
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,510
numerals<font color="#E5E5E5"> enrich</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six the Charter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

88
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,619
probably the biggest change is that the

89
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,209
Charter has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> extended to consider</font>

90
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,550
external threats or if you like security

91
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:58,280
issues there's been quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

92
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,190
concern in the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security</font>

93
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,610
issues for a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've personally</font>

94
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:07,430
had conversations with government people

95
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,340
about you know how do we ensure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

96
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:14,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet is more secure well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

97
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:17,720
September 11 as an example many years

98
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago and so the idea was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have this</font>

99
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,890
group which is overwhelmingly a private

100
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,950
industry group with service providers

101
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:28,130
and vendors sort of think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

102
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,870
make the network more secure another

103
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,300
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this charter with this</font>

104
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular charter for Henrik</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 is to</font>

105
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,780
work again expanding the number of

106
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,150
industry segments involved so to get

107
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,090
more people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from cable involved more</font>

108
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:48,099
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wireless involved and more</font>

109
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,099
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from internet service providers</font>

110
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,020
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third change is to get more</font>

111
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,539
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the council which is or the highest</font>

112
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,520
level body in this have more people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

113
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,130
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the clout to actually ensure their</font>

114
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,530
company does something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if if</font>

115
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,990
the work of the group as a whole

116
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,210
determines we need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something for</font>

117
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,710
security or something for liability to

118
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,539
have people on the council when they

119
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,030
hear this can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and allocate</font>

120
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:18,820
resources so their<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEOs and vice</font>

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">presidents on the council enric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six is</font>

122
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,469
sort of structured in a way that's

123
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,800
really pretty common for a lot of groups

124
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:31,040
there is a council that meets once a

125
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,600
quarter very rarely<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're cancelled so</font>

126
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,000
sometimes it's actually slightly less

127
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,910
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> once a quarter that is chaired by</font>

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,910
the CEO of<font color="#E5E5E5"> quest traditionally the</font>

129
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:43,430
council is chaired by a CEO<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a large</font>

130
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,930
service provider the last time around it

131
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,480
was level<font color="#E5E5E5"> three that was chairing</font>

132
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,310
there's a steering committee which is

133
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,050
basically the chairs of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> various</font>

134
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,510
focus groups get together and discuss

135
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,010
what they're doing and then there's a

136
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,190
bunch of focus groups where all the real

137
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:00,260
work gets done so once again every three

138
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,790
months or so you know the work has

139
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">gotten done in the focus groups gets</font>

140
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,270
reported to the council and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,640
notion is that if there's stuff that

142
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,530
really needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done you know we can</font>

143
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,900
go there and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wave our hands and</font>

144
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">Michael Powell is chair of the FCC can</font>

145
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,130
wave his hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get people on the</font>

146
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,010
council to listen to this who have the

147
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,390
clout to get stuff done

148
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,190
this slides a little bit busy and I

149
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,800
apologize for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's two main</font>

150
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,110
things i want to point out<font color="#E5E5E5"> here one is</font>

151
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,120
Sir the the high level structure of the

152
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,310
focus groups divides things into four

153
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,070
groups there's an area worrying about

154
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,140
security there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nary worrying but</font>

155
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,080
network reliability an area worrying

156
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:43,020
about interoperability and focus group

157
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,599
don't worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadband I'll talk</font>

158
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,549
later on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my in this presentation in</font>

159
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,650
more detail about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Homeland Security</font>

160
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,200
part of this so i won't go into the

161
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,640
subgroups there but one thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

162
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,710
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to notice you i want to once again</font>

163
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">stress is not a government group if you</font>

164
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,219
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at who's chairing each of these</font>

165
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,479
committees you notice everybody who's

166
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,550
chairing any of these committees

167
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,910
including the steering group and the

168
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,800
overall council is from private industry

169
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,960
in this case if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> include the steering</font>

170
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,480
group plus these people here there's

171
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">twelve chairs or co-chairs and eight of</font>

172
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,410
them are from service providers three

173
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,980
are from vendors and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones from a</font>

174
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:24,060
major user there is a slight tendency

175
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:26,850
toward service providers those service

176
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,760
providers who are traditionally in the

177
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,830
telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> space tend to sort of all show</font>

178
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,630
up where service providers who are

179
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:37,140
traditionally just in the data space

180
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:40,050
some show up in some don't so in actual

181
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that probably you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know every</font>

182
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,470
service provider at this point is

183
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,230
involved in the data space but it

184
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,780
wouldn't be a bad idea if a few more who

185
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,370
were you know major service providers

186
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,049
who are very heavily data-oriented

187
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,570
wanted to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up that that would be a</font>

188
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,100
good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I welcome that and I</font>

189
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,540
could point<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to the right people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

190
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to to know where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show up</font>

191
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,189
okay so going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the agenda let's</font>

192
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,830
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of security</font>

193
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:08,719
and the best practices for security I'm

194
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,669
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start off talking about what</font>

195
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:14,498
best practices are and then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

196
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:16,998
focus in specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> on cybersecurity</font>

197
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:19,219
once again<font color="#CCCCCC"> enric has been working for</font>

198
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:21,889
quite a while to deal you know to

199
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:25,719
develop best practices for reliability

200
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:31,039
and other sorts of networks one of the

201
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:35,568
sort of primary principles is that this

202
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,068
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a voluntary effort of multiple you</font>

203
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:38,509
know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

204
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:41,659
organizations coming together and

205
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:43,729
working cooperatively so to some extent

206
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,730
we're sort of doing this without

207
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,589
regulation partly so that the you know

208
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,959
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Congress and elsewhere who</font>

209
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:54,139
might be concerned about reliability and

210
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,149
security can understand the right stuff

211
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:58,160
is getting done and won't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do any</font>

212
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,449
regulation I think there's a large

213
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,880
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest in private enterprise</font>

214
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:07,060
service providers vendors and the

215
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,930
government right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in you know</font>

216
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,399
understanding that regulation is

217
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,370
something to be avoided wherever

218
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,439
possible so the implementation is

219
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,100
optional there are some best practices

220
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:22,189
that are concerned with things like

221
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,689
surges of water based on hurricanes and

222
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:25,939
you know if you're in Saskatchewan or

223
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:28,040
Alberta you<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to worry</font>

224
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:29,750
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one so there certainly will</font>

225
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,939
be cases where there's best practices

226
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,600
that don't apply to specific service

227
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:38,959
providers however these best practices

228
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,310
have been developed by a large<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

229
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,589
people from a large number of service

230
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:47,300
providers and have been validated based

231
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:49,459
on outage data and so there has been an

232
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,560
ongoing effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> to determine the</font>

233
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,479
effectiveness of these and has been a

234
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,839
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good confirmation of</font>

235
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,540
effectiveness in the last council which

236
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:03,110
ended about roughly a year and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half</font>

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:05,810
ago you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at a end of the year there</font>

238

had was a survey where they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of service providers</font>

you implement it how much does it cost

243
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:20,779
you to implement it is it risky to not

244
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,850
implement it and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> determined that</font>

245
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,070
the vast majority of service providers

246
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,290
already implemented the vast majority of

247
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,720
best practices and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

250
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,610
service providers said that the cost of

251
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,889
implementing specific best practices was

252
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,480
low and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are effective in</font>

253
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,519
preventing outages and that there's a

254
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,380
risk to not implement them so it

255
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,930
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a big surprise you know if</font>

256
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,550
the folks who develop the best practices

257
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,739
then get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say is it</font>

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,040
nonetheless reassuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't want to</font>

261
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,290
say that much<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this this is this a</font>

number two there we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> endure</font>

265
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:13,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific commercial products or expect</font>

266
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,920
people go to go out and buy documents

267
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,089
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number for their talks about using</font>

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,969
best practices that are already

269
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:22,040
implemented so in many cases what this

270
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,190
does is document things that people have

271
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">already done to prevent various forms of</font>

consensus

276
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:42,610
the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on best practices is</font>

277
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:46,330
focused on this homeland security area

278
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,880
and that split into four parts there's

279
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:52,690
physical security which includes things

280
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,790
like controlling who has access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

281
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,290
manage your machines somewhere in there

282
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,829
there's probably something about not

283
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">using simple passwords you know exchange</font>

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,190
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the clear and don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the name of</font>

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">equipment there's cyber security so you</font>

287
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,480
know how do you deal with worms and

288
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,830
viruses and do s attacks and so forth

289
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,270
there's a group thinking about public

290
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,710
safety that group<font color="#E5E5E5"> is concerned with how</font>

00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,380
the telephone network the wireless

come to their help when there was a big

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,170
to restore stuff so that mutual aid and

317

working together to recover from

318
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:29,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">disasters is a ongoing and common</font>

319
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:34,180
practice so let's focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> in on</font>

320
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:36,910
cybersecurity the cyber security group

321
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:40,920
is chaired<font color="#CCCCCC"> by Bill Hancock who's the</font>

322
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:44,170
head<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security for cable and wireless</font>

323
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,949
so the Charter is to generate best

324
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,120
practices for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity in both</font>

325
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,790
telecommunications and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

326
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,089
day and data networks they've come up

327
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,680
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of best practices the</font>

328
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:59,440
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which are aimed at</font>

329
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevention there was I think there's</font>

330
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,680
actually been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple more breast</font>

331
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,170
practices developed since the initial

332
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,279
set but they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up initially with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 100</font>

333
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,899
best practices for prevention and 45 for

334
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,269
recovery so there's sort of a lot of

335
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that one could do to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> improve the</font>

336
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,450
situation

337
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,640
let's look at how some of the supplies

338
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,950
to the slammer worm because that's one

339
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,380
where it actually could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

340
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,920
prevented in a few cases was actually

341
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,470
prevented from accessing some networks

342
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,550
one issue is the propagation<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I my</font>

343
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,900
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that there have been</font>

344
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,490
presentations on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slammer worm</font>

345
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,520
everybody is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very familiar with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

346
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,140
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go very quickly over it I think</font>

347
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,750
everybody smoother with the very rapid

348
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,790
propagation time that you know one worm

349
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,770
produced another copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of itself on the</font>

350
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,870
average they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about every eight</font>

351
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,490
point five seconds which if you do the

352
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,320
math means in something like 10 minutes

353
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,000
every atom in the universe has a warm on

354
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,130
it which implies that somewhere before

355
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,630
that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> its had to start slowing down</font>

356
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,380
because it's running<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of uninfected</font>

357
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:04,740
systems to attack what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means is</font>

358
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,750
that you can't really well if you solve

359
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,090
it by waiting till it happens and then

360
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,800
reacting<font color="#E5E5E5"> you basically let the network</font>

361
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,540
collapse and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to put it back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

362
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,370
again if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want the network to keep</font>

363
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,319
operating you have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something a</font>

364
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,670
priori to stop something with a speed

365
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,710
from hitting you

366
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:24,770
one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was quite interesting to</font>

367
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:27,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">note is that there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

Enric best practices for prevention that

369
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,510
could stop the slammer worm and there

370
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,459
were some cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> of service providers</font>

371
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,740
that were either completely unaffected

00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,350
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> only minimally affected because on</font>

373
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,900
the most part they had already deployed

374
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,630
some best practices that happen to be

375
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:47,780
effective here this<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide gives a</font>

376
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,330
list of best practices that would that

377
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:53,209
that are documented and written up in

378
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">the android</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best practices and which are</font>

379
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:59,150
applicable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stopping the slammer work</font>

380
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:04,180
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a few of these there's a</font>

381
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">pointer here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

382
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,910
actually meant to bring my laser pointer

383
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,820
or should it shoots if you look here

384
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,650
there's three in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:22,960
security hyper patching patching and

software patching over here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

387
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,680
vulnerability that the slammer worm

388
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,620
exploited is probably everybody already

389
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,870
knows here the fix for that was

390
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">available multiple months in advance so</font>

391
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,460
for any service provider that had kept

392
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">up to date on all of their patching</font>

393
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,960
they'd already fixed the along<font color="#E5E5E5"> nur</font>

394
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,940
ability there's also a best practice

395
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,560
about system inventory saying

396
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,360
essentially you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what</font>

397
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,920
equipment you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there well</font>

398
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously you can't patch equipment once</font>

399
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,910
you know you have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so that's</font>

400
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,010
again applicable in a sense to prevent

401
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,010
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm aware there's stuff about</font>

402
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,600
validating source addresses again if you

403
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,640
validate source addresses the slammer

404
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,260
worm used random source addresses so the

405
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,000
overwhelming vast majority we just get

406
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,560
wiped out right at the first router if

407
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,990
the first router was validating the

408
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,208
source addresses there's also best

409
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,140
practices about dealing with denial

410
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:16,569
service attacks things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate</font>

411
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">limiting traffic and so on which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

412
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,459
would cut down the amount of traffic

413
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,560
that the slammer worm could gobble up

414
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:27,100
disabling unnecessary services so if you

415
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,470
have a server out there that's got SQL

416
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:32,230
on it but you don't use SQL on that

417
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,490
server shut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the cyber</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah it</font>

420
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,639
strikes me is extremely<font color="#CCCCCC"> unlikely that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

421
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,190
significant number of those machines

422
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,610
were actually in ISPs they were in user

423
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,070
hosts right so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the patching</font>

424
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,469
practices of the ISPs but the end users

425
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would have affected the ultimate</font>

426
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,480
vulnerability of the network to the

427
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:58,540
slammer worm well but there are there

428
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">were service providers who well of</font>

429
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,450
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's also the amount of</font>

430

own

432
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,549
there were cases of service providers

433

turning off UDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports that were not used</font>

a priori and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dumping the traffic as</font>

intense so can you safely turn off UDP

436
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,960
ports / 1024 that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> question you</font>

437
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">could do it and see if somebody</font>

438
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,299
complains or you could rate limited I

439
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:27,918
believe you can safely rate limited if

440
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:30,389
you have boxes that can do rate living

441
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,100
but validating source addresses is

442
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,350
another thing even if you validate at

443
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,760
the ingress to the service provider you

444
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,129
could have an entire corporate network

445
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,389
out there but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can still validate the</font>

source address<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's not coming from</font>

449
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,230

452
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:54,750
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example of a best practice</font>

453
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:56,039
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here I mean I'll pause a</font>

458
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:10,110
a little unreal or use on any element or

exactly what to do right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't tell</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn off this one particular service</font>

463
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:24,870

464
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:29,428
about and that tends to be common to the

466

responding if you can do it most of

these sub bullets here really were

you know there's a bunch of implications

of that but it's a bad thing there's

also the matter of the support costs

right if your network is going down

476

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,610
is to wait till things go down and then

some forms of attacks that you're seeing

get your management to let you deploy

or two at least reduce the severity of

why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not he said well they'd be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

577
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:00,080
useful if we could but the particular

578
00:23:55,669 --> 00:24:01,760
routers we have if you turn on packet

579
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,870
filters the performance collapses to the

580
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,460
point where you might as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well just</font>

581
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,770
disconnect the interface so that's what

582
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,600
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we disconnect the interface so I</font>

583
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,429
said well why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just buy routers</font>

584
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,500
where you can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on active filters and</font>

585
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:13,790
he said oh well my management's already

586
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,440
made the decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> as to what to buy</font>

587
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:18,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">without looking at any of the details</font>

588
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,870
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I just have to go with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

589
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,939
hardly thinking about that conversation

590
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,799
and partly thinking about the

591
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,500
conversation last night<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the security</font>

592
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,650
bomb I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the most helpful</font>

593
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:34,250
thing I could do here is give network

594
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:36,080
operators and engineers sort of

595
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,420
you know stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can take their</font>

596
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,550
managers to scare the bejeebies out of

597
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,080
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's some managers out</font>

598
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,419
there who need their virginity scared

599
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,189
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the first thing to start</font>

600
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,290
with that I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with is this</font>

601
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:51,380
slide which is nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

602
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:55,610
data which i<font color="#CCCCCC"> took from cert you go to ww</font>

603
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:57,470
sorg click on statistics and you see the

604
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,959
number of security incidents that have

605
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,850
occurred over the last seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

606
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,890
there's also data now for the first

607
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,000
three months<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this year and there's</font>

608
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,160
really two things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

609
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,410
obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know even a manager's</font>

610
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,200
manager could get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this slide one</font>

611
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:14,030
is that it's a very very rapid increase

612
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,240
and the other is that it's a very very

613
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:19,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">big number you know 82,000 security</font>

614
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,400
incidents in one year<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an awful lot</font>

615
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,290
and it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sensible that most of</font>

616
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,020
the incidents don't even get reported to

617
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,420
cert so there's an awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

618
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,060
out there we all know that that we need

619
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to convince other people that it's worth</font>

deploying fixes they also have

vulnerability on information as well at

622
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,000
there and there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more if this does</font>

623
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,350
not scare enough of the bejeebies out of

624
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,550
your managers there's one more place to

<font color="#E5E5E5">go poking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around I found a paper by a</font>

get right to a paper that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she wrote on</font>

634
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:22,010
the potential liability of denial of

635
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:24,830
service providers who fail to protect

636
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:27,170
their networks papers called the Nile

637
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:30,379
I'm sorry distributed denial of service

I think she asked if anybody had any

thank you
