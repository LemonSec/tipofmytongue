1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
well Sue's hooking up her laptop I know

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,730
she's most nervous about me introducing

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,110
her because i know many stories and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,309
thought of<font color="#CCCCCC"> when to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell but I won't</font>

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,730
because well I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't but Sue and I</font>

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,650
go way<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to one of my very first</font>

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,080
networking job actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> Susan as well</font>

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,729
for a while there was at University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,669
Michigan there was Susan r Harris who's

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,990
in p p harris and susan hairs and for

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,420
the longest time<font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought they were all</font>

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,830
her so in a meeting i exclaimed how

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,300
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do all these things how can</font>

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,800
you write the campus and lose letter and

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,690
all these things as it turns out it was

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,760
three people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was a little relieved</font>

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">but anyway sue is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason that i got</font>

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,660
my first engineering job she probably

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,819
doesn't remember but I've always been

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,319
appreciative of the lies she told<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:52,469
it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and she's here to give a talk</font>

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,050
it's true it's so true but it was it was

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,910
all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spirit of getting me to help</font>

24
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,038
her help her fix routing problems so

25
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,078
that she could<font color="#CCCCCC"> go on to you know the</font>

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,110
routing registry stuff and making the

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,060
NSFNET safe so anyway with<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

28
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,060
hooked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up oh cool well here's to</font>

29
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:36,020
so first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started all of this</font>

30
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,908
and kudos to our previous speaker and to

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,990
Randy in his panel because maybe this

32
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,670
talk is now not as well needed which is

33
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,589
why we tried to cut some of the time

34
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,400
period but so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull</font>

35
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,409
out a few points because the way I got

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,960
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this talk is why should we</font>

37
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:58,670
talk about bgp attacks you know though

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,949
there's a couple things when i was

39
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:04,009
looking at bgp and as the co-chair

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,800
people have asked me you know how

41
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:11,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">serious do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take into account</font>

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:14,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP security in the ITF the security</font>

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,000
80s have wanted us to really be rigorous

44
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,680
in our look and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,370
real world problems because if you don't

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,130
have real little problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're</font>

47
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,380
building code that's for pie in the sky

48
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,690
or something

49
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,290
it so one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been pressed</font>

50
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:36,370
on is when you how will our the security

51
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:38,260
concerns from the government and one

52
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,720
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steve alluded to the fact that</font>

53
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,980
they have started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really take a look</font>

54
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,950
at it and I actually found a couple

55
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,950
interesting quotes after the attack on

56
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,410
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers in October there was a</font>

57
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">quote from one of the people schmidt</font>

58
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,590
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US government that says we're</font>

59
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,690
looking for institutionalizing the

60
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,550
standard program protocols for

61
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,370
communicating back and forth between the

62
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,890
root super community protocol and the US

63
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,310
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> AKA watch out they're coming</font>

64
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:10,029
for that and then there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

65
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,820
that talks about in February they have a

66
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,220
strategy to secure cyberspace whose goal

67
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,829
is to engage in power Americans to

68
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,470
secure portions of inner cyberspace that

69
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,150
they own operator control of which they

70
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,630
interact that isn't the routing

71
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:28,150
infrastructure I don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

72
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,730
and it does actually specify bgp

73
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,190
protocols and<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS protocols it's a one</font>

74
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,660
to five year plan so in case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't</font>

75
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,400
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government actually had</font>

76
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,950
comments on this and I'm sure Russell

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,500
Krauss will go on to two more fun

78
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,269
comments but I actually found those on

79
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,660
public websites and there are people

80
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,670
looking at it so as I went forward I

81
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,400
started this to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a panel of</font>

82
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,440
people standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and saying like Rob I</font>

83
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,040
got a real problem here I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

84
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,990
what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I fixed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in my network</font>

85
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,350
that's not what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got I got a lot of</font>

86
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:04,810
quiet so I'm here with the ITF saying

87
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,930
gee<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got a really secure it and I</font>

88
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to say only if you do</font>

89
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,400
infrastructure

90
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,050
well we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

91
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">analog steering committee and I think</font>

92
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,100
Curtis when we talked about the review

93
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,130
the previous slide and tried to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

94
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,130
some real comments about what the

95
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,270
vulnerabilities were what could happen

96
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:28,740
where should you look what you should do

97
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,599
came up with one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best quotes it's</font>

98
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,550
the disservice to the community to talk

99
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,960
about the existent exposures without

100
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,510
being specific about what those

101
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,120
exposures are there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally</font>

102
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,159
only only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good guys factor but that</font>

103
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,440
only goes so far in reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

104
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,480
tell the good guys first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

105
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,930
context of looking at vulnerabilities

106
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,640
it's hard for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to talk about them</font>

107
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,550
unless we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have fixes because as</font>

108
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,490
Steve last time Steve gave us talk

109
00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:01,470
attacks followed and so I understand

110
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:03,690
people not talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

111
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,630
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there might be a reality</font>

112
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,000
where it's not your most pressing attack

113
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,980
as our previous speaker said you know

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,860
attacking with TCP sins and various

115
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:17,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">things might not be as easy as just</font>

116
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,040
getting a compromised router password so

117
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,040
that's why Eric and Bill say there

118
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,930
aren't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> in attacks and Vijay said</font>

119
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,930
well we have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that the vcp</font>

120
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,700
could fix you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this high</font>

121
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,440
amount of prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again I'm</font>

122
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,719
pleading one of the normal reasons as

123
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,600
you miss configure the routers so how

124
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,270
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have your maximum prefix</font>

125
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,280
filters or prefix filter set there are

126
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:45,130
syn floods to<font color="#E5E5E5"> port 179</font>

127
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,179
and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack well our last speaker</font>

128
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:51,490
went into that please take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at it</font>

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,160
internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop be GPS which are</font>

130
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,650
hijacked and inject bad routes which is

131
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,320
a variant uncompromising bad routers

132
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,409
it's another thing may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> caused by</font>

133
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,290
those clear text passwords i know in

134
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,570
Alaska presentation we showed you how

135
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:12,010
many clear text passwords we can find in

136
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">this room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ana nog wireless perhaps we</font>

137
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,480
ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about that and you know</font>

138
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,849
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done ulti</font>

139

hot bgp over IP second Dave Ward did

140
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,460
some really good work in how to talk

141
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,100
about ipsec and you'll find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

142
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,510
thing now Susan I apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this not</font>

143
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,790
being in the notes but a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of these</font>

144
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,820
notes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got just on the comment that</font>

145
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:37,000
they wouldn't go in the notes so this is

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">a case that Rob Thomas went over this</font>

00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,550
about fixing your router security

152
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,919
putting prefixes filters on prefix so we

153
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,320
don't mean to be unhelpful in the nanog

154

they'll make both dis announcements

160
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:17,370
sort of spoof you so what's going to

161

attacks and attacks and they say huh

168
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,760
what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it matter you know but I think</font>

169
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,359
if we begin to socialize the routing

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,460

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so remember that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks scope when</font>

I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people and I'd really really</font>

174
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,960
like to hear more specifics in my ITF

chair Pat Lam sure Randy and I'm sure

176
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,049
Steve would like to hear pieces about

177
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,780
real attacks because then we can wait

178
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,420
solutions you know attacks go after the

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,169
reconfigurations of routers the

186
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,990
questions that eventually when we get

<font color="#CCCCCC">past the ups I screwed up or this</font>

myself talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steve's talk to someone</font>

283
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,010
