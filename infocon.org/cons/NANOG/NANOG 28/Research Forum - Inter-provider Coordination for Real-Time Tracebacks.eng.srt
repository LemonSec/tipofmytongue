1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,910
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get started here with</font>

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,340
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about a</font>

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,580
proposed internet draft on a protocol

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,450
that I call rid or real-time internet

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,539
works defense and this is a method of

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,609
integrating integrating all the various

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,820
single trace mechanisms used on a

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,890
network in order to be able to

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate across network boundaries</font>

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:33,239
and so it seeks both use existing

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,010
standards and all of the various trace

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,120
mechanisms that I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to find</font>

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:44,099
out there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just is the communication</font>

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,789
mechanism between providers some of the

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,200
larger issues are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical and so</font>

16
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,590
the draft touches on what some of those

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,210
are and has some suggestions but I'm

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,329
hoping for feedback on both the

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,280
technical and the social issues that

20
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,219
many of you would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more familiar</font>

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,650
with famous on a daily basis<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I my</font>

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,650
fate and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally I'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

23
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">small-scale implementation using email</font>

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,280
for transports and the protocol is

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,990
actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP based one email was used</font>

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,759
just for simplicity for<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing sake</font>

27
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,330
based on some suggestions from some

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,330
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> at isb</font>

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,979
okay so some of the goals of red is too

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,309
be a real time methods mitigate the

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,630
effects of dust and<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDOT attack site by</font>

32
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,340
providing a way to trace the cross

33
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network boundaries and this would also</font>

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,710
work for security incidents if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

35
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,110
a smooth source some of the goals were

36
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,600
also to respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network boundaries in</font>

37
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,720
that many of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> streets mechanisms</font>

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,298
require you to be configuring equipment

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,590
across your network and so when you

40
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,899
reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> the border of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your network in a</font>

41
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,820
trace how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the next providers</font>

42
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,710
do that will rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sends a request</font>

43
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,960
providing all the information needed to

44
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,600
the next upstream provider and ask them

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,609
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you continue this trace and based on</font>

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,910
information given and the status<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

47
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,760
network they can make that decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

48
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,489
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned it's meant to integrate</font>

49
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,130
the trace mechanisms that are available

50
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:26,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">as well as any new and developing ones</font>

51
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,870
and detection methods as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

52
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meant to solve those problems it's</font>

53
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,880
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help integrate those together</font>

54
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,329
now here's just a quick example so you

55
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:42,420
have a target at your clients of the

56
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">pink network and they detect they're</font>

57
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,130
under attack so in this instance they

58
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,260
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what types of traffic they're</font>

59
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,750
seeing they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sample of that on</font>

60
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,959
their network and they send a RHIB

61
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,020
request to their upstream is<font color="#CCCCCC"> P and this</font>

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,209
is inclusive the client level because

63
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,950
that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way for you to pay for</font>

64
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,620
this type of assistance so if you offer

65
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,480
this service to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your client then that</font>

66
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">may be some motivation for you to</font>

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,480
actually deploy something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

68
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,010
revenue is important so the client sends

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,780
us to their isp their eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font>

70
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is reasonable</font>

71
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,390
or it's not reasonable and if they

72
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,950
decide to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead with the trades</font>

73
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,768
requests<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll send a message a ridge</font>

74
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,149
message back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their client and say yes</font>

75
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:31,440
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead with this trade</font>

76
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,750
for no we're not and once they say that

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,579
they will then their individual trace

78
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,470
mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> user cross or network would be</font>

79
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,230
utilized to either find the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

80
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the attack or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> border network and in</font>

81
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,369
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> example we'll go through to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

82
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,010
the blue network so once that's

83
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,110
identified they then send a trace

84
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,609
request the blue network and say hey I'm

85
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,180
seeing this traffic is coming from your

86
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,160
network could you please continue this

87
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,049
trace and the blue network makes their

88
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,739
decision yes no and sums that response

89
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,770
back to the pink network and in this

90
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,010
case they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font>

91
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:10,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes my example a little bit better and</font>

92
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:13,280
and then they determine after performing

93
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,500
their single trace that they have the

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,380
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the attack on their network</font>

95
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,870
and in order to address some privacy

96
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,790
concerns the blue network may have an

97
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,370
SLA agreement with their clients that

98
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,980
says well okay we will provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

99
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,980
information back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the originator of</font>

100
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:34,790
this request saying that yes we found

101
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:38,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the source and we did something about it</font>

102
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:40,280
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we did it may even be just</font>

103
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,900
be that you contact to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client where</font>

104
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,659
you may have something automated that

105
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,919
would let you automatically filter out

106
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,210
the traffic but you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to</font>

107
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,820
either provide or not provide the

108
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,489
contact information of the person

109
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,900
attacking your system now<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a more</font>

110
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,210
complicated example if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

111
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,190
intermediate network and since this is

112
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be based on peer relationships</font>

113
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,150
you're going to have bilateral trust

114
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,650
relationships established through all

115
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:10,640
the upstream ISPs so all of the messages

116
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,340
will see in the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it goes from</font>

117
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,020
the client under attack to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pink</font>

118
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,289
network to the green network to the blue

119
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,150
and then the source all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> rig</font>

120
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,460
messages would have to pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> through each</font>

121
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those systems because that's how the</font>

122
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,388
trust relationships are established

123
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,780
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be something you would</font>

124
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:33,699
work out in peering agreements with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

125
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,698
providers or that you period

126
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,340
so with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tres mechanism this is aimed</font>

127
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,020
at single<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network trace systems across</font>

128
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,780
your network examples of that would be

129
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,830
things that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> net flow or network</font>

130
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,960
flow analysis based or hash based IP

131
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,330
trace back and rid would handle the case

132
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,090
where you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that dynamically</font>

133
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,190
where you receive this request and then

134
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,140
you were to<font color="#CCCCCC"> really look for that traffic</font>

135
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,270
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in your network or if you</font>

136
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,539
have a stored method such as the hash

137
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:07,190
based on IP trace back and hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

138
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,810
still have that time

139
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:12,330
in which the attack occurred stored on

140
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,280
your system it wouldn't work but might

141
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,250
complement something like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trade</font>

142
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,359
pact which is probabilistic and more of

143
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:23,160
an end-to-end solution where you would

144
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,630
end to end solution would be where you

145
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,449
would be gathering all the path

146
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,060
information some extensions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

147
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,979

148
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,830
Steve Sullivan about this would be for a

149
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,300
push back in some cases you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not get</font>

150
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the way to the source to be able to</font>

151
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop the traffic and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you may want to be</font>

152
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,840
able to mitigate as close to the source

153
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:45,169
as possible by doing some rate limiting

154
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,739
and so that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think would be a useful</font>

155
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:51,630
purpose for this as well now the

156
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,070
parameters for the trace approaches so

157
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,469
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you would need in your</font>

158
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:58,919
trace request going out is the superset

159
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,510
of what I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be needed by all the</font>

160
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,460
various trace mechanisms that I could

161
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,680
find which would be the time in which

162
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,349
the attack occurred<font color="#E5E5E5"> the non changing</font>

163
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,289
feels of the IP header and then the

164
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:11,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">first eight bytes of the packet payload</font>

165
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:15,870
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other please let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

166
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,920
your feedback and collaboration would be

167
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,380
greatly appreciated

168
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,470
now for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internetwork</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communication</font>

169
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,700
you would be setting<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a system that</font>

170
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,140
you would be communicating with your

171
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,580
peer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this might be a network</font>

172
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,020
management system so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

173
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,669
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of security implications here</font>

174
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,370
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to protect this</font>

175
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,750
resource and so within the draft there

176
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some provisions about the security</font>

177
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:40,990
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems as well as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a method for</font>

178
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,940
authentication and encryption of these

179
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,310
sessions ideally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be great to</font>

180
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,410
use an ativan connection however that

181
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,140
might not be realistic so authentication

182
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:54,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">with into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> channel would help to solve</font>

183
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:56,650
that and let's see so these

184
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,150
relationships might be established

185
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,400
through appearing agreements and at that

186
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,640
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might work out any legal issues</font>

187
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">or ways to determine between your</font>

188
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,919
various providers how you might

189
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:11,230
interpret the severity of requests that

190
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,360
you receive so that you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

191
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,520
basing on whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you're basing</font>

192
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,460
whether or not you'll continue the trace

193
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,380
on the actual type of attack that you

194
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,570
see but a confidence rating that may

195
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,850
correlate back to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

196
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:29,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty established between you and your</font>

197
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:31,930
peers and with your clients you may set

198
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:35,969
this up with their<font color="#CCCCCC"> FLA agreements</font>

199
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,969
and um see

200
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,299
so with the notification and attack

201
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,280
mitigation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes into play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

202
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:45,469
last message the source was found and

203
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,670
what actions might be taken as a result

204
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:53,470
of that if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to block at the</font>

205
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:56,479
source or filter out the type of traffic

206
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:59,090
or just call the client so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all</font>

207
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,000
options and that would need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

208
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,040
integrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network or done</font>

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,350
manually depending on on how you would

210
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:11,660
prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that and another potential</font>

211
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,190
problem of this system could be that if

212
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,949
there are multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> traces in a</font>

213
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,810
distributed denial-of-service attack you

214
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,600
may wind up causing<font color="#CCCCCC"> advancers against</font>

215
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,489
yourself so bandwidth dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

216
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,850
actually receive these requests is

217
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,740
important and then also looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your</font>

218
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,690
resources on your network to determine

219
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:35,510
how many traces can I support it a

220
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:37,820
single time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> queueing those up to a</font>

221
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,680
reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> number and only doing you</font>

222
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,540
know based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network resources as</font>

223
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,239
well as keeping track of what you've

224
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,500
already done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's a table an</font>

225
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,970
incident table that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would maintain</font>

226
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,890
of all of your recent trace attempts so

227
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,960
that you could say no I've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

228
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,510
this that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would prevent a loop in</font>

229
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,360
multiple traces if lets you have a

230
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,600
client that's multihomed or system

231
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,170
that's broken or

232
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,110
somebody at one of these trusted ISPs

233
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,349
down the line has some malicious

234
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,519
employees so those are important to note

235
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,120
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and there's also a human</font>

236
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">interaction factor so if it there</font>

237
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,589
besides just be approved and deny

238
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,680
there's also a pending status so if your

239
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:24,480
automated response doesn't automatically

240
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,388
say oh yes I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue this</font>

241
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,740
trace or no you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the option to the</font>

242
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:31,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">system to sit there and wait until</font>

243
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:35,970
somebody can make that decision on

244
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,979
behalf of the system so getting to the

245
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,839
email based test system well rid is just

246
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,100
a messaging system it's pretty simple so

247
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">it has worked and some of the lessons</font>

248
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,850
that I learned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this were</font>

249
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:52,980
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> two so the algorithm is much</font>

250
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,470
further along now and it's based on the

251
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">current draft version so I'll have to</font>

252
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:01,680
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes as it evolved and as your</font>

253
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:05,130
suggestions come in besides that some of

254
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heper integration pieces are with</font>

255
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,350
interacting with all the various single

256
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:12,779
trade systems so your individual trade

257
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,300
system is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to receive a red message</font>

258
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,759
and say I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perform this trait</font>

259
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,380
that has to interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your systems</font>

260
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,240
to be able to perform that tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

261
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait for the response to see what do you</font>

262
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,180
do next do you have a source<font color="#E5E5E5"> found or</font>

263
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,860
are you going to generate yet another

264
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,359
request and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to enter this</font>

265
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,730
into your state table to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

266
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,279
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing multiple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requests and</font>

267
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:39,149
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be in your your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> incident</font>

268
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,220
state table to keep track of the

responses<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you'll be receiving over</font>

270
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,410
time from the upstream peers that this

271
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:49,470
may traverse until you get the message

272
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,250
thanks or<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tracey request</font>

273
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:56,340
denied

274
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:59,760
and so in my test I I used the resources

275
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I had and I don't have a large</font>

276
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,189
network to play with with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> full-blown</font>

277
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:09,180
trace mechanism so I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> wood pcap on</font>

278
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:12,060
one server that was searched capturing

279
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:16,099
packet headers and use net flow with net

280
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:18,810
flow tools on on another system and

281
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,240
basically implemented the trace

282
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,060
mechanisms where one would receive the

283
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,870
email parse off the header information

284
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:32,760
process the request and take subsequent

285
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:34,170
actions and then if and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it to</font>

286
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,650
the other network and then respond

287
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,079
appropriately with either the allowed or

288
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,800
denied messages and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source</font>

289
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,800
found message

290
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:50,040
so some of the current issues I guess

291
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:54,660
the technical ones are the easier ones

292
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:57,540
to deal with the social<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that will</font>

293
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,120
be the more complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is in</font>

294
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,189
the internet draft standard process so

295
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,900
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the major issues is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

296
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,090
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need more more feedback I do</font>

297
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:09,270
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in looking</font>

298
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:12,240
to implement this already however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

299
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,730
think more review is necessary in order

300
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,120
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out exactly what what is</font>

301
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,470
needed to help solve this problem and

302
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,000
more collaboration from people doing

303
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:25,050
these types of approaches so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

304
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the major major issue and then</font>

305
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,060
working out to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the social</font>

306
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:33,720
issues are too big of a problem or if

307
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,780
there are ways that those can be worked

308
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,270
through and so in summary r it is trying

309
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use the existing and developing</font>

310
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,829
technologies for single trades and

311
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,570
integrate those for faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> tradesmen</font>

312
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,580
across multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> network boundaries so</font>

313
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,020
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not making phone calls it's quick</font>

314
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:53,670
automated you get the actual message

315
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:56,460
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a dedicated fashion so that</font>

316
00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's brought to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the attention to</font>

317
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:03,839
correct people very quickly and then to

318
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,910
look further into it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is</font>

319
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,730
at the URL listed or if you search on my

320
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:12,490
last name it would be in the individual

321
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft submissions and my email address</font>

322
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:22,450
is Moriarty mor I ate our<font color="#E5E5E5"> py at ll MIT</font>

edu which is also listed on the draft

324
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:28,839
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a mailing list set up for</font>

325
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,089
discussion so if you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> me an email I</font>

326
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,830
can answer to that discussion lists and

327
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:36,899
hopefully we'll get some some useful

328
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,899
input out of it thank you

329
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,599
when you sent Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> books when you say</font>

social issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really mean things</font>

331
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,670
like the legal issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> of disclosing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">packet content to another legal entity</font>

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:56,490
without authorization consider yes that

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,290
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one yes and also coordinating</font>

335
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,449
the social issues might also include

336
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:04,139
coordinating the communication between

337
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:05,639
you and all of your peers and that might

338
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,589
be done through peering agreements<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

339
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,940
one thing that I could think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we</font>

340
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:12,420
kind of know how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

341
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:16,470
minute it gets to your slides was

342
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:19,500
telling who the user was that's the

343
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:23,430
lawyers right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so as a result</font>

344
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,829
of feedback that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've gotten I left out</font>

345
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:28,589
or I added the part where you can leave

346
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:32,069
out who the source was from and another

347
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:36,360
stipulation to is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that let's say you're</font>

348
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:39,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">an ISP off of only one isp there is an</font>

349
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,990
option to have that upstream<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp respond</font>

350
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:45,319
on your behalf with the actions he can

351
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,730
at the end so that would help to

352
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:51,089
alleviate those<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy concerns as well</font>

353
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:53,060
and as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as integrity of the source of</font>

354
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:55,889
the trade as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> digital signature</font>

355
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,768
included on the packet from the

356
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:02,810
originator of the request and so that

357
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:02,810
should help<font color="#E5E5E5"> to alleviate those issues</font>

358
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,730
yeah john Larson I'm curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

359
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,640
response time in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing</font>

360
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:13,990
we've already seen attacks that have

361
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:18,920
over 140,000 source machines and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

362
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:20,570
aggregate OC 192 with these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

363
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,670
scale attacks you can envision and

364
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,950
dynamically shifting attacks with the

365
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,300
large army even basically perhaps keep

366
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,830
somebody down for a long time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

367
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,800
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a response under the system</font>

368
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:34,550
just by shifting its active<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present</font>

369
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:39,800
severe your army mm-hmm ok this is this

370
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:42,260
is indeed a deed asshole in itself right

371
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,030
the timing issue I think would be more

372
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,000
on the single Network trace mechanisms

373
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:49,250
implemented across your network so this

374
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,400
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to help speed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up the</font>

375
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,650
communication between providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

376
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,170
open and<font color="#E5E5E5"> flexible to use whatever is</font>

377
00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:00,110
developed so as technology evolves and

378
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:02,180
that becomes faster hopefully that issue

379
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:06,460
will be addressed but this is a very

380
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple communication mechanism</font>

381
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:13,840
I hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps a little bit</font>

382
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,839
as your question

383
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,500
thank you kiss me thank you
