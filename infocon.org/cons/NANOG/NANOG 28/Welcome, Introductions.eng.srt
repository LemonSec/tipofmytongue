though with this kind of a conference is

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,600
a thing I'm saying so hopeful of that

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,350
change when things get more important

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,030
during the conference one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate the most is to come to a</font>

trend with CIOs by the way that state

63
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,290
background in my history but basically a

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,220
government leader and has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG in

67
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,869
between but in my past life I was the

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,420
lieutenant governor if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's offered two</font>

69
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,800
terms of those kind of guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I was</font>

70

invited to give a speech at a rural

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,819
electric meeting at the down in one of

72

our beautiful<font color="#CCCCCC"> little southern Utah towns</font>

73
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,909
many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago during an election year</font>

74
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,769
second term and I arrived there thinking

75
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,079
that everybody knew who I was and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

76
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,210
was doing in order will you talk any of

you ever been<font color="#E5E5E5"> to order value to us</font>

78
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,670
boy we've got somebody here ought to be

79
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,230
careful with this story anyway there was

80
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,329
my pitch pitcher was in the local

81
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,790
newspaper two weeks before<font color="#CCCCCC"> one week</font>

82
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:31,140
before there were posters illegally

83
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,970
tacked to the telephone poles few days

84
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,609
before and I arrived thinking that

85
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,770
everybody would know who I was the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

86
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,680
shaking hands and meeting people in the

91
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,070
to him and I said hello I'm valo vison

92
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:00,859
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for lieutenant governor</font>

93
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,859
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got my vote</font>

95
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,610
damn good

96
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,250
that story is the metaphor for what it's

97

<font color="#E5E5E5">like to be a CIO in terms of the</font>

00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:16,599
of researchers on campus who have made

142
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,830
us aware of things beyond just the few

143
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,830
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on today</font>

144
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,500
like to thank a few people first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

145
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,590
all the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you see besides the</font>

them have<font color="#E5E5E5"> never been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to nanog and may</font>

152
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:44,130
never go again but they were willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

153
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,010
support this effort and so treat them

154
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,690
nicely they're trying to do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good job</font>

155
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,800
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank Rodney even though</font>

156
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,719
he'll probably embarrassed that I'm

157
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,790
thanking them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's his</font>

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,460
experience in showing me what it takes

159
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,080
to host a dog that made me willing to do

160
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,900
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise it felt somewhat</font>

167
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:23,010
people have been very generous with

168
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,450
their staff and finally both Union and

169
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,360
you've you provided a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of equipment</font>

170
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,630
and tools for some reason I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

171
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,430
an rj45 crimper and I had to borrow one

172
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,850
so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're they're running things</font>

173
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,260
while we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mess around here a</font>

174
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:40,140
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about the network first of</font>

175
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,240
all word about ten network savvy hotels

176
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,159
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great that the hotel here</font>

177
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,860
is hosted conferences somewhat<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

178
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,450
before they had wiring in place and so

179
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,730
forth but as many of you probably

180
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,979
noticed they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless network in</font>

181
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,990
place we do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of wireless</font>

183
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,860
having trouble getting onto the wireless

184
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,260
network because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that make sure that</font>

185
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,050
you pick the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano 28 network and not the</font>

186
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,640
sgsn network we've got a few wireless

187

cards that have some problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

188
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,530
so if you're having troubles they can

189
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:13,570
get you connected with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cards</font>

190
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,969
we are using for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our connection up to</font>

a wireless wide area network I don't

193
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,920
know if anybody's used this before but

194
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,710
we felt like it says kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pioneer</font>

195
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,840
territory and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually working</font>

196
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,270
quite well we spent plenty of time

197
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,270
testing it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's to your</font>

198
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:37,329
satisfaction the analogy that I've used

199
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that hosting nanog as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

200

hope you find it clean and to your

206
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,250

you'll use it there are some there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

America there are providers and we've

Utah as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> two national exchanges</font>

226
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,670
so hopefully that will provide for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

try something different with the shirt I

we've been coordinating nanog since we

00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,670
started the group in 1994 we are a

non-profit based at the University of

267
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:04,498
Michigan in Ann Arbor I took a look at

268
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:07,120
the proportions of various occupations

269
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:08,470
represented at this meeting and a couple

of previous meetings especially

271
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,379
interesting i was hoping because our

272
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:16,389
numbers are slightly down this time and

273
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:19,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see first when compared to eugene is</font>

00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:27,459
you just start to see a change<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>
