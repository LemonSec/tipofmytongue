1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,490
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here to talk to you today about</font>

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> national infrastructure advisory</font>

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,530
councils vulnerability disclosure

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,480
working group which is a real mouthful

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:17,130
I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about working with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">group whose acronym has a.d.d in it this</font>

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,750
is a group<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been working</font>

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">actively this spring Paul vixia is one</font>

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,269
of the working group members I was

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,420
really hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul would be here today</font>

11
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,240
and he had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> family emergency had to</font>

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,420
attend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he is available in</font>

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,040
cyberspace so if you have tough

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,690
questions send them to Paul send me the

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,219
easy ones I'm sure he will answer the

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,809
National Infrastructure Advisory Council

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,829
is a presidential Advisory Council

18
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,629
there's all kinds of laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

19
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,520
regulations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> govern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> governed how</font>

20
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's set up and how its run important</font>

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,129
thing is it doesn't have any federal

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,230
officers on it their federal officers

23
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,239
who participate but the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> council</font>

24
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,339
is made up of CEOs or the equivalent

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,780
from private industry state and<font color="#CCCCCC"> local</font>

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">government other large organizations and</font>

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,260
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

28
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,770
regulations a little bit too i'm working

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a specific working group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

30
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,949
subcommittee of the of the Advisory

31
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,960
Council the one of the things to note

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,939
about this group is while the advisory

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,189
councils are a matter of public record

34
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,080
and have to have deliberations that are

35
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,270
public and open the subcommittee's do

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,429
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in addition the subcommittee's</font>

37
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,070
cannot make statements about content

38
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,579
that the larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisory council is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

39
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,279
approved so and there's other rules but

40
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,559
the main thing is do not ask me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,630
you what the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> output of this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Advisory Council will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be of the working</font>

43

44
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,750
the background stuff and we're working

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">on and most importantly I need to get</font>

46
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,050
your input on this project

47
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,690
and I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got ahead of myself on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

48
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,370
slide we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be part of a boss</font>

49
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,080
session later tonight during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ICU</font>

50
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,120
security boss very greens hosting I

51
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:04,340
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> the details but they're on the</font>

52
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:07,700
agenda the mission is scope that what

53
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,410
the working group is about I'm sure

54
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,380
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here is well acquainted with</font>

55
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,180
the bad handling of a vulnerability it

56
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,579
is painful<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this a long</font>

57
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,100
time for all the expertise and

58
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,459
experience that I have at it I still

59
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,200
make mistakes at it but I will dare say

60
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:27,110
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I make far fewer mistakes and most</font>

61
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,060
people the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I see at this</font>

62
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,620
is the lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sharing of</font>

63
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about vulnerability handling</font>

64
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,410
and as a result there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people all the</font>

65
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,390
time jumping<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the fray with a lack</font>

66
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,880
of experience and most importantly lack

67
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,470
of questions and things to think about

68
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point they screw it up</font>

69
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,680
royally I'm full of war stories my

70
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,019
credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the bar later</font>

71
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,030
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I can we can help entertain</font>

72
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,380
each other with war stories the goal of

73
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,930
this group is to pull together

74
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,209
guidelines that will be active little

75
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,820
globally the group recognizes at the

76
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:04,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet's a global space however it is</font>

77
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,500
a US federal group that is charged with

78
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,500
coming up with the framework so the

79
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,810
focus will be obviously national in

80
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,120
particular the working group also has to

81
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,500
write specific recommendations for the

82
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,079
president to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the federal government</font>

83
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">to implement so it's basically two</font>

84
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:23,299
documents one inside the other our

85
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,770
current goal with framework is to work

86
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:27,110
on a

87
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,270
a larger document that describes the

88
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,770
complexities and then we will extract<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

89
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,030
appendix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say out of all these</font>

90
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,100
different complexities in each category

91
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:39,290
this group should do this particular

92
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">item I think everybody in here knows</font>

93
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,040
that vulnerability reports continue to

94
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,920
increase each year it gets a little more

95
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,380
ridiculous so don't worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that one</font>

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,760
the other three points you are important

97
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,280
the working group members have a wide

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,500
variety of backgrounds and experience

99
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,420
that they bring to the group fundamental

100
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,210
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the group is you have some</font>

101
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,649
organizations whose job it is to tell

102
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,030
everyone about us here security

103
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,190
vulnerability simultaneously<font color="#CCCCCC"> who shows</font>

104
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,630
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> favoritism and try to get the word</font>

105
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,480
out there certainly groups who would

106
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,500
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep them secret forever</font>

off to the side it's a complex place and

some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those conflicts can't be</font>

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:06,910
think they're all explained elsewhere

131
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,770
the problem definition those two are

132
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,980
obvious but let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me speak about full</font>

139
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,440
argument is the most people disagree on

140
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,370
the schedule and this group is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

be trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address some of the</font>

152
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:58,420
we're here and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip those</font>

153
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,270
there are several different groups that

154
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,639
are working on this I know you've heard

155
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the inch efforts there's a sort of</font>

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,550
a bender corner inside first it's

point also working on this what we've

163
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:31,900
noticed is that none of these efforts

164
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:36,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly overlap with this group and the</font>

timeline one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> august is an</font>

166
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,389
interesting struggle we intentionally

167
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,680
set an aggressive schedule for this

168
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:43,060
working group because we were worried

169
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,010
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> losing momentum and worried about</font>
