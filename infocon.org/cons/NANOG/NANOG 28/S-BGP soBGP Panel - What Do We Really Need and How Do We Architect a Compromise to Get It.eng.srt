00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:07,710
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> night look we all</font>

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,620
got a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of routers out there</font>

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,639
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in trouble because we're kind</font>

of exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> robble hopefully sing a</font>

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:22,140
little on this subject but what's the

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:24,960
threat model to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP speaking routers</font>

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,510
and I would contend its first ones

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,590
configuration error if you remember the

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:35,940
good old 7007 incident or the 128 / 8

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:39,780
incidents where you know major providers

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,230
were taken out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for days there's a</font>

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,879
traffic diversion attacks related to

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">Steve's work and he'll tell you a little</font>

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,710
about that there's distant data based

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,800
attacks or spoofing to try and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

16

router to do stupid things there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> DDoS</font>

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,559
to again traffic diversion forest path I

18
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,968
believe we also need to protect against

19
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,250
monkey in the middle and wiretap

20
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,619
attackers and people who wear funny

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,400
clothes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and live near Washington DC or</font>

22
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:16,520
pretty strong about that and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:20,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want an interim solution</font>

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,199
that I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to rebuild my</font>

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,990
network all over again with the second

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:31,259
solution later but i do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> strongly</font>

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:33,570
make the point that the danger we're

28
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,100
talking about to your router's into my

29
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,460
routers is not theoretical it's stuff

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:46,139
that is happening and has happened as

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:49,770
long as two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I know of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,950
backbone that I worked on where it was

33
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,740
owned for at least six hours

34
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,619
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we detected it was</font>

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:02,280
somebody one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the miscreants touched a</font>

36
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,149
configuration and the sweeper that

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:10,140
watches configurations every hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> coated</font>

38
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:14,660
so this is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> theoretical sign this</font>

39
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:17,609
is real your<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers and my routers and</font>

40
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:22,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working internet are seriously</font>

41
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,780
threatened<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this picture was a road</font>

42
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,690
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week and a half before this</font>

43
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:36,480
picture was taken you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

44
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:40,379
be your network maybe you do so

45
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,329
if you remember in February 2000 at the

46
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,920
last hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the water was so soft</font>

47
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,209
it took you half an hour to get the soap

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,760
off you in the shower like this one

49
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:53,190
Steve<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe first described DDoS</font>

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,540
attacks as he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking the first</font>

51
00:02:53,190 --> 00:03:01,519
major attacks on big sites occurred

52
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:07,109
let's hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> today we don't rien stat</font>

53
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:11,280
there are essentially two proposals each

54
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:14,609
poorly documented wandering around the

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,569
ITF space for solving this problem one

56
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:23,430
of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> SB GP by Steve Kent and crew</font>

57
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:27,358
at BBN which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve Bell oven will</font>

58
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:31,590
characterize for us the other is soo

59
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:34,410
signed origin bgp which overall will

60
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:39,180
characterize for us that's floating

61
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:43,400
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the valley first we're going to</font>

62
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,400
hear a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dave and andrew on</font>

63
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:51,540
operators reviews of this and then i'm

64
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:56,040
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to sum up with where I</font>

65
00:03:51,540 --> 00:04:01,220
think my personal prejudice is where we

66
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:04,590
can go forward in a compromise

67
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,660
unfortunately neither of the two things

68
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,500
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> old they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all relying on expired</font>

69
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:14,000
Python 00 drafts there is no current

70
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,779
solid work on these protocols

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,959
and we'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> you some detail later I'm</font>

72
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:24,830
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> toss it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto Steve you want to</font>

73
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,310
plug your laptop in Steve there I'll get

74
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,310
rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this one</font>

75
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,360
okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any pretty pictures or</font>

76
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,729
any nice pictures like that but I can

77
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:03,770
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd if I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a network ID want</font>

78
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to be on Hawaii okay this is a work</font>

79
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,820
in progress between Andrew I and

80
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,460
everyone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room so it</font>

81
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,890
supposed to be interactive I've gotten a

82
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,239
lot of information from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of you as</font>

83
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,010
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this as we've been</font>

84
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,300
building these slides so stand up and

85
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,280
talk anytime you want including<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

86
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,690
quit Sanders so in looking at this on

87
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,729
Andrew and I were tasked with kind of

88
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,710
coming up with what our operator hat

89
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,530
perspective looked like so here's the

90
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,820
agenda we came up with first<font color="#CCCCCC"> China kit</font>

91
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:37,880
oh by the way how much time do we have

92
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:39,590
you know all right okay we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font>

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,590
to characterize the problems we are

94
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to solve then ask the question</font>

95
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:48,500
why aren't we deploying one of these two

96
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:51,110
or other or other solutions what are the

97
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,490
complexity issues and what's the 10,000

98
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,690
mile view that we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anyway</font>

99
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,150
and maybe if we have some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

100
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,680
discussion will do that and these slides

101
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,909
if anybody should happen want them are

102
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">there um if somebody wants to end the</font>

103
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,510
magic point source i can give you that

104
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,550
so here's that here's the view of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

105
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,659
problems we're trying to solve as Randy

106
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,290
pointed out there's a lot of threat

107
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,880
model work going on including trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

108
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,920
characterize configuration mistakes

111
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,800
attacks like the one that's Steve and

112
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:29,159
his co-author just published about using

113
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">link cutting techniques and then of</font>

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,270
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the whole set of the that</font>

115
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,549
are new and and things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't</font>

116
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,250
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> her detected yet so a lot going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

117
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,810
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I showed these slides to rob</font>

118
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,130
thomas just helping you now to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

119
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,370
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's the first thing he</font>

120
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,780
gave me he<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically said on this is</font>

121
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,330
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> life and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we really</font>

122
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,000
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking at right now with</font>

123
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,280
some with some as randy said with some

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,050
urgency so in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were wondering</font>

125
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,700
hijacking an homage is is a big problem

126
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,320
for us right now so if we if we look at

127
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,789
this as and we go well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have</font>

128
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,650
these sheets problems why aren't we

129
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,340
deploying some kind of secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp right</font>

130
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:13,130
now well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> randy pointed out there are</font>

131
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:17,849
two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of works in progress on this</font>

132
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:19,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure bgp and secure origin bgp and the</font>

133
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that came to mind is well why</font>

134
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,080
aren't we deploying neither of these

135
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,909
well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is doesn't appear</font>

136
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,650
that there's to any community consensus

137
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,540
on what the right solution to this is

138
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,130
right now these are proposals and as

139
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,140
randy said<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're works in</font>

140
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,070
progress in various states of

141
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:40,070
documentation

Danny

143
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:48,240
Danny I hear ya yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'd</font>

144
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,460
actually be happy to see who are you in

145
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,499
can you speak up a little bit Danny

146
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">Macpherson I'd be happy to see owner</font>

147
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:58,849
provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ralph filters much less I don't</font>

148
00:07:55,289 --> 00:08:02,580
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this stuff ok we'll get to that</font>

149
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:04,699
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so so as Danny points out</font>

150
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,020
there's no community consensus on this

151
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,689
there's a complexity issue here and

152
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,340
we'll get to their that in a second but

153
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,050
and there's also sort of a paradox<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade</font>

154
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,508
<font color="#CCCCCC">off as arose is with complexity but</font>

155
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,340
insecurity in the security areas it's

156
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,710
sort of acute and this is the court I

157
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,869
like from from Steve when I was trying

158
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write about complexity and what it</font>

159
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,300
meant for security in whatever RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3439</font>

160
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,389
and whatever that thing was he said this

161
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">um which is true so we're kind of have a</font>

162
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:34,349
paradox here or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trade-off</font>

163
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,149
that we have to be cognizant enough that

164
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,150
we're making so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what about the</font>

165
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:43,080
complexity aspects of this

166
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,490
well both both s s bgp and SL bgp seek

167
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,350
to protect different parts of the

168
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,420
routing system via cryptographic means

169
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,880
but there are some common things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

170
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,560
can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about they both want to protect</font>

171
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,480
allocation of IP addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

172
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,650
numbers of course and in some cases

173
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,330
protect granny the granting authority

174
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,030
for the chunks of address space that are

175
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,770
out there and for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP messages and</font>

176
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:07,230
pairings um this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the places</font>

177
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,939
where sob GP and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alvaro I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

178
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this but um this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the</font>

179
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,160
places where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> diverge because s bgp</font>

180
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:18,780
seeks to really protect the entire and

181
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,850
end system where the ssl bgp authors

182
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,150
take this apart a different part of the

183
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an overall problem so in general</font>

184
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,240
you might want to authenticate every

185
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,370
step in the life<font color="#E5E5E5"> cycle of an IP</font>

186
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,900
allocation of an IP address and how it's

187
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:36,690
used from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iono from one isp to</font>

188
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,970
another to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer e to the a s</font>

189
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,830
number allocations to permitting an ass

190
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,620
to originate right routes for some

191
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:46,260
address space and in general all bgp

192
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,580
traffic including AAS pass which would

193
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,689
protect against some of the things that

194
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,459
Randy was mentioning next tops all of it

195
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,260
so I was talking to rob about this again

196
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:58,119
and here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said I just find</font>

197
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,829
these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because he</font>

198
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,269
injected some pragmatism into the whole

199
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:05,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing and basically he was saying that</font>

200
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:07,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you know so many routers don't</font>

201
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,610
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CLS on their vgy is much less all</font>

202
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,980
of this other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if it's hard to</font>

203
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:16,720
do simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> how can we do complex so</font>

204
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:18,430
that's something to keep in mind so all

205
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is out there floating around</font>

206
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,790
with designers of both of these

207
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,740
protocols and with the operators but

208
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:27,849
what's our 10,000 mile via what do we

209
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,680
want out of all of this well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

210
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">can agree that almost every bgp speakers</font>

211
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,209
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify that the address</font>

212
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:37,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">space has been properly allocated that</font>

213
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:39,880
the a<font color="#E5E5E5"> is origin a s is valid that the I</font>

214
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:41,380
this is what we're well the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s</font>

215
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,060
path being valid is one of the ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

216
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,430
we'd like but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure that's</font>

217
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,140
that's the point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> contention other</font>

218
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,810
attributes and in this case I was

219
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,060
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about because I've had VPN bgp</font>

220
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,219
signaling for VPN on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the line on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind</font>

221
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:59,349
for a while and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was wondering well</font>

222
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:01,810
if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this on ipv4 nlr I</font>

223
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:06,130
are you going to do it on ipv4 VPN lri

224
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,449
or l2vpn NRI and in and in addition to

225
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,250
that does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> too small I know in</font>

226
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,019
addition to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are their security or</font>

227
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,670
even other implications of continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

228
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,000
throw almost everything into bgp what

229
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,000
does it all mean

230
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,410
so the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notice it that there are</font>

231
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,149
cryptographic signatures that will be

232
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,010
needed that will need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be checked and</font>

233
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,350
verified at various steps at different

234
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:30,710
places for the different on for the

235
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:33,050
different approaches but at at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

236
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">10,000 at the 10,000 mile we probably</font>

237
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,920
like to have a system that would do all

238
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,089
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us but all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

239
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,149
comes at a price and of course that

240
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:46,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">price is operational complexity and</font>

241
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:48,880
additional infrastructure so what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

242
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,880
should we do

243
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,199
so here's here's what here's the one

244
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:54,279
event this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of Andrews ideas how</font>

245
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:55,839
about pre collecting all of the

246
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,050
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> into local database and</font>

247
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,819
running an authentication checker<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

248
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,339
only send right the router<font color="#E5E5E5"> precompiled</font>

249
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:04,628
chunks of data instead of everything so

250
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,699
these are incremental approaches that

251
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:08,470
we've been thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about but the router</font>

252
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:10,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">still needs additional processing and</font>

253
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,550
memory to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font>

254
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,459
that's something to think about into the

255
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,019
future and it's still unclear how big

256
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,729
this information would need to be or how

257
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:23,100
much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much of that information a</font>

258
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:25,660
router would need to carry around and

259
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,829
hit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that of</font>

260
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,420
course we're always concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

261
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,099
introducing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dependencies into the</font>

262
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,050
routing system that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it either</font>

263
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,720
converge or recover more slowly and so

264
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:38,769
that's something to think about so

265
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,600
continuing on what we might do the point

266
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a point of all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that discussion is</font>

267
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,360
that there's a non-trivial amount of

268
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,050
infrastructure that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support</font>

269
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,230
to do this databases certificate

270
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:53,319
authorities all of that stuff what's the

271
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,120
effect on BGP convergence we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

272
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,470
here's here's the one that's kind of

273
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">near and dear to my heart who pays</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

274
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:02,380
all this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we know capex and</font>

275
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,410
opex is kind of the frontier for the

276
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:08,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">carriers these days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are also</font>

277
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:12,130
free market issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what's to stop a</font>

278
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:14,080
user who from moving to lower-cost ISPs

279
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,700
who don't provide this service and in

280
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,940
fact with this would this generate a new

281
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of no SLA service and if it did</font>

282
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,590
what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:27,100
general as a whole the routing system of

<font color="#E5E5E5">that came up earlier that is this guy is</font>

287
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,079
this going to inject time in into

288
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,880
getting a prefixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> announced which</font>

289
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,480
people getting a prefix announcement

290
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:44,140
people seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unhappy about as it is</font>

291
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,670
well for SL<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp signatures and</font>

292
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,740
certificates have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> generated in the</font>

293
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,510
same way as with SVG p but the

294
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,690
propagation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information is</font>

295
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,910
different and instead of relying on

296
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">out-of-band databases in some form of</font>

297
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,600
synchronization the certificates are

298
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertising a new message the security</font>

299
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,110
message so this thing should have

300
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:07,990
propagation delays and timings that look

301
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,300
like update propagation so in theory s

302
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP won't add any administrative delay</font>

303
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,430
to getting your prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce your</font>

304
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,450
prefix announced in theory how about<font color="#CCCCCC"> SVG</font>

305
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">p</font>

306
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,020
by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> two people see that as an</font>

307
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,910
issue time from when you get a

308
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,910
allocation to when it can be announced

309
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:30,310
I'll be can you go to the microphone and

310
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,490
um tell who you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and all of that good</font>

311
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,489
stuff

312
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,180
yes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go to the microphone and</font>

313
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,260
tell who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and all of that good</font>

314
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:44,390
stuff or yes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other question yes</font>

315
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do think it's important also one of</font>

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:51,140
the given that<font color="#CCCCCC"> SB GP or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sob GP or other</font>

317
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,839
competing proposals which may or may not

318
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,290
exist yet will not be completely

319
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,180
deployed across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet initially</font>

320
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,860
one of the defense's when someone is

321
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,650
actually trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack your space or</font>

own space announce it more specifically

324
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:13,369
and being able to do at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

325
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:16,760
think is important and if there are

326
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,080
places where you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it when you have a</font>

327
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,060
split model where some people are not

<font color="#E5E5E5">running any you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know advanced protocol</font>

329
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,050
some people are I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to be</font>

330
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,329
able to react pretty quickly to that

331
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,250
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work with some providers where</font>

332
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,780
we've had customers had legitimate need

333
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,190
to announce<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new address space pretty</font>

334
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:35,449
quickly all taken well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so let's let's</font>

335
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,310
look at what we think might happen with

336
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:41,480
SB GP course this is all hypothetical

337
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,709
right because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have it but so</font>

338
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question is will it take a new</font>

339
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,550
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> will it take longer to get a new</font>

340
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">address routed if we have s bgp out</font>

341
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:53,300
there and that the answer that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

342
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,620
and why is because of the fact that all

343
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,900
the signatures involved have to be

344
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">generated sign</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> publish to local database</font>

345
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,030
and pushed around in various ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

346
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,360
are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily congruent with the</font>

347
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:07,430
update topology

348
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,410
and so the question we have on this one

349
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,810
is are we willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make that trade-off</font>

350
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,579
as a community or as individual

351
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:17,229
providers it's a question that needs to

352
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:21,290
be answered so finally on all of this

353
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of finally if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

354
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,839
additional processor and memory storage

355
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,189
needed on a router at least for SB GP

356
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,519
it's going to cost somebody something

357
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,870
and again back to who pays for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this are</font>

358
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,510
we going to raise the price of the

359
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,800
service how's this going to work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

360
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,430
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Randy has some thoughts on that</font>

361
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,319
and talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that earlier there's an</font>

362
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,739
alternative an alternate or alternative

363
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,089
position on on this that maybe go so

364
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,490
what Danny was saying earlier which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

365
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,200
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be solved</font>

366
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,450
by current by currently deployed

367
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,430
techniques you know like be TSH ingress

368
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,420
filtering unicast could have pointers to

369
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,180
this for those who don't know if they

370
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,589
are a unicast RPF and maybe cleaning up

371
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,930
the registry systems and things like

372
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:05,140
that how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the window could be</font>

373
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">closed</font>

374
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,880
it's a question that needs to be

375
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:12,250
answered and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it be</font>

376
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,679
enough how would we define enough and

377
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,839
for how long would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be enough so the</font>

378
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is is this an incremental could</font>

379
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,678
we do something incremental in the in

380
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,629
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of incremental like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Randy was</font>

381
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,490
describing or would this be the band-aid

382
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,929
and then we throw this away when we got

383
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,220
something better there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

384
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:28,539
opinions on this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there I'd be</font>

385
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,110
interested in what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have to say</font>

386
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:33,940
about that so trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some final</font>

387
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,469
thoughts through here what are the

388
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,049
cost-benefit trade-offs we're looking at

389
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:41,289
those are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult and so far we</font>

390
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:43,150
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any real quantification of</font>

391
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:45,900
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody has thoughts or ideas on</font>

392
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:48,460
that please step<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and tell us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

393
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,309
is there an incremental deployment model

394
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,169
we think there might be with with both

395
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:55,120
of these in the case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> SB GP we might</font>

396
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:57,630
be able to start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> just signing the</font>

397
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,428
origins and then over time buildups

398
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:03,370
forward signed a s paths or something

399
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:05,919
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it's important to</font>

400
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">note that SPG sob GP has a different</font>

401
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,520
model where it doesn't sign updates but

402
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,460
instead it has the certificates in the

403
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,620
security message oh yeah and of course

404
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if you ever wanted to write a</font>

405
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,219
draft about this and have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it go through</font>

406
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:23,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ice star you have to deal with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

407
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:26,559
last thing um which I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure I'm not</font>

408
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,440
sure how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble that causes so</font>

409
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,330
finally the reading on this as randy

410
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,020
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these documents are all kind</font>

411
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">of in various state of decay and this is</font>

412
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,320
where they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to look look</font>

413
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:41,080
at them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had highly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advised reading</font>

414
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,730
both of them so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question becomes</font>

415
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,439
what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next steps for the operator</font>

416
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,870
community on all of this just sit here

417
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,429
try to deploy one of these try to find a

418
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,799
new model try to make them all come

419
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:53,820
together where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go that's the question</font>

420
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,820
that we really need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

421
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:12,670
mr. Rob breaking news oh hi everybody

422
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,670
Rob Thomas

423
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,800
those of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> who know me know the</font>

424
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,740
hardest thing I will ever do is stand

425
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,419
still at a microphone but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will try so</font>

426
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,420
we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about yes</font>

427
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:34,559
see we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the technology we can</font>

429
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,129
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about bgp threats and one of the</font>

430
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,360
problems we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is that there's still</font>

431
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">people out there the unbelievers who</font>

432
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,189
don't think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real threat so</font>

433
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,570
I've got breaking news for all of you

434
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:54,960
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have routers that speak</font>

435
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:59,040
bgp what a crowd what a crowd<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

436
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">to teach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how to own any bgp speaking</font>

437
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:07,170
router<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to take notes cuz it's</font>

438
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:08,940
gonna stay in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here</font>

439
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:20,340
goes are you ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the command it's</font>

440
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:24,570
one command bang be<font color="#E5E5E5"> g p.s enter</font>

441
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:27,658
that's it this is how the miscreants get

442
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,820
your router's people will compromise

443
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:32,940
routers that speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP they will target</font>

444
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,039
them by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and then they will make</font>

445
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,580
them available in the underground

446
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:43,020
economy and to get one of those it is as

447
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:46,799
simple as typing bang be<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS in certain</font>

448
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:50,908
channels and out comes a router IP what

449
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:56,070
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you suppose the password is cisco</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C 1</font>

450
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:59,039
SC 0 that one always stops them the

451
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:02,668
point here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that routers are being</font>

452
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,820
owned on a massive scale and routers

453
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:07,740
that speak BGP have an even higher value

454
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,789
by the way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you who are</font>

456
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:15,450

457
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:16,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">bots require a valid credit card how</font>

458
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,799
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you think the miscreants use</font>

459
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,799
their own

460
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,030
the point I'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> home is if</font>

461
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:31,090
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not a threat I'd like</font>

462
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:33,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your a s number this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

464
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,340
underground they're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of</font>

465
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:39,670
it today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> heaven for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a long</font>

466
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,889
time quick thought why would anybody

467
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:44,800
want to be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be speaking router well</font>

468
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rob wants them because they're cool but</font>

469
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,500
they want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a variety of reasons</font>

470
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,809
spammers pay big money and when I say

471
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,170
money i mean real money not credit cards

472
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:57,550
not shells not other routers no practice

473
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:59,290
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will use BGP speaking</font>

474
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:02,320
routers to announce allocated yet

475
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:05,530
unadvertised space to figure out if

476
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody will squawk how many of you</font>

477
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,129
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would notice if somebody</font>

478
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:12,790
announced a more specific prefix under

479
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:16,750
your prefixes I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> lobby put your hand</font>

480
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:18,610
down we knew that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font>

481
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:24,160
they'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they're not</font>

482
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:26,649
subscribed to Nana if so once they

483
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,040
figure out that space doesn't cause any

484
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,320
pain<font color="#E5E5E5"> any squawking they will then turn</font>

485
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,420
around and use it to generate spam so

486
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,980
those you've been Joe job not just of

487
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,860
your domain but perhaps of your prefix

488
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,330
now you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it happens by the way</font>

489
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:44,110
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people who call themselves IP</font>

490
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,610
brokers who will do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing pay</font>

491
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,469
some miscreant to announce a net block

492
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,080
see my squats then they'll turn around

493
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:53,320
and sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote-unquote that net</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> block to</font>

494
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,980
very naive private providers dude I

495
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,530
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a slash 16 I can help you</font>

496
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:03,360
the low low price of I've got some swamp

497
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:04,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry so the very quick point and</font>

498
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,939
I'm never quick that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make</font>

499
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,820
is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real threat but</font>

500
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,020
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't take much to raise the bar</font>

501
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,510
those you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have town that open to the</font>

502
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,250
whole world those use cisco or<font color="#CCCCCC"> caiman or</font>

503
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever is a password this is your</font>

504
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">wake-up call it came too late your</font>

505
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:24,360
routers are probably already owned so

506
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,429
take the time to raise<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bar do the</font>

507
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,100
simple things listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what these fine</font>

508
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:32,130
fine folks are saying and get on board

509
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,899
because we're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind this isn't</font>

510
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,450
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> case of let's beat them we've been</font>

511
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,940
beaten now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to recover that's it</font>

512
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,660
Rob so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bar by cleaning up</font>

513
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,660
the stupid stuff

514
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:46,240
you know turn off<font color="#E5E5E5"> till that I'm your</font>

515
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:48,820
stick it now consider etc get some

516
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,130
access lists in there

517
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,899
how likely is it that the bad boys and

518
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">girls are just going to follow the</font>

519
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,450
raised bar well the underground is an

520
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:02,990
amazingly adaptive place so as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise</font>

521
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:04,370
the bar so will they the interesting

522
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,620
thing though is that the underground is

523
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:10,969
also an incredibly lazy place by and

524
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:13,939
large so we let's face it folks we've

525
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,529
not challenged them we've not made it

526
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,020
difficult for them to do what they do

527
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:20,870
and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way now they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making real</font>

528
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,750
money doing what they do they've got

529
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:27,739
motive right they have customers to

530
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:29,929
satisfy just like on the bus so they

531
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:33,559
will raise the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar but we need to buy</font>

532
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:35,120
that time we need to start excluding the

533
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,649
simplest of miscreants we need to make

534
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,840
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't just type bang be</font>

535
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:41,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">GPS or bang Cisco or bang caiman or</font>

536
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,600
paying anything else and get 20 of the

537
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:46,580
things at one crack to give you a feel

538
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,330
for how bad it is one bot I recovered

539
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:53,389
this is over a year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a half ago</font>

540
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:57,860
included 3,400 compromised routers to be

541
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:59,340
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bots as a proxy all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3400</font>

542
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,530
worked

543
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:08,399
I didn't test it I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like that how</font>

544
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:09,990
many a esas it was about 17 so you know

545
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,340
if that was over a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a half ago</font>

546
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,820
what do you think it's like now much

547
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,280
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rap so again keep mine</font>

548
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a very real threat don't talk</font>

549
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,550
theoretical anymore those days are gone

550
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:26,550
and that ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> my gloom and doom I'll try</font>

551
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:28,050
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quick three points the simple</font>

552
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:31,440
thing to watch for that I've seen a lot

553
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:33,330
is people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up their own tax</font>

554
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,070
service how many people run tak kak<font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font>

555
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:39,389
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I guess I'm alone have you</font>

556
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,740
know the router people set them up

557
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,720
because you wouldn't trust those IT

558
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,010
people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch a UNIX machine and then</font>

559
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't looked at the machines for two</font>

560
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,820
or three years so i would encourage

561
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,730
people to consider regularly auditing

562
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:53,520
those machines second point we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

563
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:56,010
monitor for more specifics change in

origin ASL that we don't monitor change

565

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,420
prefix that couldn't be attributed to a

572

couldn't be attributed to just a

573

575
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,240
part of the problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hasn't</font>

and say s bgp is silly because no one's

processors and no one's done simulation

585
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:47,280
assuming paranoid levels of cpu load or

00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,800
bgp load and the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who wrote it</font>

587
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,090
have never seen you know routers operate

588
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,649
and don't understand that sixty percent

589
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,610
average load<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean that you</font>

be constructive and maybe it's educating

593

the people who are working on the

594
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,660
designs or maybe you know in terms what

595
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,110
you could realistically deploy maybe

596
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,580
that's what the provider community

597
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:09,500
so far I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a little bit stumped</font>

598
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:13,580
myself but that's why we have so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

599
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:16,100
smart people sitting around I think the

600
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,860
point that Rob's got we shouldn't

601

belabor too much we should just we

602
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:25,159
needed Rob to make the point this is a

603
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:27,020
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> real and very current problem and</font>

it's not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better it's going</font>

605
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:33,710
to get worse I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean one</font>

secure your router's today our tutorial

610
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:47,530
I think that's a point but I think we

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:51,550
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus the rest of the panel on</font>

here too long term protocol strategies

Randy Dave referred to this new attack

638
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:23,759
thing about that attack is that's an

attack that succeeds even after we have

today with robbers talking about

the middle of the net isn't modifying an

like a legitimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s path but it goes</font>

an address block when you start

678

announcing it you have a certificate

saying you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right to this</font>

advertisement very beginning the more

682
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,809
interesting thing is that the updates

683
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:24,320
are digitally signed each update you

684
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:26,690
send out is digitally signed there is an

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:31,100
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> based PK I used to generate</font>

686
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:33,919
these certificates you get your

00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,769
addresses from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR or from your</font>

688
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,419
upstream or from your provider when you

689
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,250
get an address block if you're a BGP

690
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:43,909
speaker they give you a certificate with

691
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:45,919
it there is no new trusted party in this

692
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:47,450
you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> your certificate from the</font>

693
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,039
same party who's giving you your

694
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,470
addresses so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are no new trust</font>

695
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,809
paths there is new software there's a

696
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,340
bit new procedure but once this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

697
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:58,340
in place I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's going to</font>

698
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,649
be any delay once we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> steady state</font>

699
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,879
on using this thing because when you get

700
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:05,080
the address block you'll get the

701
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:05,080
certificate along with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

702
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:11,399
the most important thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens is</font>

703
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:15,299
that the signing party said signs a

704
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:18,870
message saying this is who the next hop

705
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:21,720
on this is path is and this chain of

706
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:24,330
signatures gets carried along with the

707
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,389
BGP update messages throughout the net

708
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:29,370
as an optional transitive attribute yes

709
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:31,889
this does expand the size of BGP

710
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:33,959
messages the<font color="#CCCCCC"> steady-state overhead isn't</font>

711
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:35,879
actually not bad it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> start up</font>

712
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,679
overhead<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be expensive in terms</font>

713
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:44,159

00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:11,450
the big providers um one part of the

863
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:19,808
to make it quite as clear one of the

00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:26,410
Andrew makes an announcement today if it

00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:29,839
makes an announcement to me of a prefix

867
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:37,220
Andrew signs that announcement saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:52,369
I sent it here it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Dave signs</font>

873
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:55,780
furthers when he sends it to me signs

874
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:59,059
and says I'm taking this prefix and

875
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,460
Andrew signatures on it and I'm sending

876
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:05,050
it to Randy

877
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:08,050
okay so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the path and to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

a lot about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but at least when you</font>

00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:21,549
to me I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part of the path was</font>

882
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:24,009
really intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> not smooth even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font>

origin registration is something that

<font color="#CCCCCC">should be pushed but you've at least got</font>

887
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:42,549
some knowledge that the last steps on

888
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:45,310
the path are certified that would be for

889
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:48,540
those paths that are not authenticated

just so difficult to do if you've got a

this is a non-trivial problem for us to

well and in any customer service

situation I've been in if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing</font>

to go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the details but i'd be</font>

very<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy if those digital certificates</font>

1013
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,440
were actually created by my isp because

1014
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:18,319
i have a business relationship with my

1015
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,930

1016
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,069
maintain in the case of the routing

don't have to i have nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else to go</font>

1019
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:28,129
to and i can give you numerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples</font>

1020
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,630
where I'll just you know for example

1021
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:33,140
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a routing registry but it's</font>

1022
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:35,480
a DNS registry my you know contact data

1023
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,000
for mit.edu was was fouled and

1024
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,220
unchangeable for five years because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1025
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't get anybody to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to</font>

1026
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:44,029
fix a broken system that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had and it</font>

1027
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,029
only got fixed when they became

1028
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:49,130
competition for registering things and

1029
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,359
so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can easily predict cases where you</font>

00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't seem to get that certificate</font>

1031
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:53,690
renewed because there's some

1032
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:55,670
bureaucratic foul-up over here and

1033
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,500
meantime<font color="#E5E5E5"> a clock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is ticking tick tick</font>

1034
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:00,530
tick tick tick tick tick I think

1035
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:02,560
slamming verisign is kind of the

00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:07,490
operators equivalent to God wouldn't

1037

Peter

1039
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:18,710
because we do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish the panel</font>

1040
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:20,300
ok so I'm Peter Lawford I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we</font>

1041
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,980
are getting things in the right order

1042
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,020
this seems to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that needs to</font>

1043
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">be fixed but we have another similar</font>

1044
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,800
thing in in the internet that I would

1045
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:32,120
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see working first that's called</font>

same kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ingredients as all the same</font>

down that the pair if they even have a

1050

protocol in IETF and damn it why can't

1051
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:48,350
you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work to start with I'd</font>

the other one was dns

there much longer but if you want to

<font color="#E5E5E5">GP we have many of the same objectives</font>

1064
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:47,440
of course and are coming from many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

the same or the same thread models as

1066
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:54,069
everyone else what is different is the

1067
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:56,199
way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are proposing to do things pretty</font>

00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:58,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">much so we all know the Internet is very</font>

1069
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:01,180
important that I spent together we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1070
00:48:58,299 --> 00:49:07,329
know it's a follower vulnerable too many

1071
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:09,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why we're one of</font>

1072
00:49:07,329 --> 00:49:12,459
the reasons were here let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1073
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:17,469
both sbtn sotp is because this solution

1074
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:20,769
requires n2n agreement versus many parts

1075
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:23,709
of the overall security of the internet

1076
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:26,609
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our point solutions that can be</font>

1077
00:49:23,709 --> 00:49:29,669
deployed on a router / router or peer

1078
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:32,739
prepare or session per session basis

1079
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:34,500
things like inbound filters maximum

1080
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:37,470
routes

1081
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,600
any other router specific implementation

1082
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:43,740
enhancements also including things that

1083
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,750
are not part of the protocol itself like

1084
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,759
secure in a compromised router which

1085
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:51,510
does affect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> provo most consistent</font>

1086
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:54,270
but is at least in my opinion or outside

1087
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:57,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the realm of the protocol what the</font>

1088
00:49:54,270 --> 00:50:01,140
protocol should protect the other part

1089
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:05,580
of it is the transport connection we in

1090
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:08,400
our work don't mention or don't make

1091
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,880
reference to using IPSec 25 or anything

1092
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,800
else because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we believe is that is</font>

1093
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,870
one of those other mechanisms that can

1094
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,410
be used to protect part of the whole

1095
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:21,900
system we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in any moment against</font>

1096
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:24,089
using IPSec or anything else in fact you

1097
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,880
know use whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want sob GP in the</font>

1098
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:29,540
part that I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and the</font>

1099
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,540
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1100
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,870
verifying the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> authenticating path</font>

1101
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:38,620
etc that s<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp also covers works over</font>

1102
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:41,080
ipsec or not per second so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well bgp</font>

1103
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,180
is trying to solve the problem of

1104
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:46,630
validating that an autonomous system is

1105
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:51,520
in fact authorized to originate<font color="#E5E5E5"> poop a</font>

1106
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:56,290
prefix and by doing that we also done we

1107
00:50:51,520 --> 00:51:00,450
also can verify that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path is a valid</font>

1108
00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:04,180
path to the origin of the advertisement

1109
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:09,460
so we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> down this road by putting</font>

1110
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:12,009
ourselves some design requirements and

1111
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,330
these are these are some of them one of

1112
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:15,970
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one sec advantage of the</font>

1113
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:18,490
existing internet architecture the trust

1114
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:20,740
relationships that already<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist the way</font>

1115
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:22,419
address or for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> assigned and</font>

1116
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:26,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">dedicated from a speech customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1117
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:31,000
etc we want to of course impact as<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

1118
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:33,490
you can the current protocol and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1119
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,320
current system so the objective has been

1120
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:37,720
minimum changes to the program which you

1121
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,600
can and try to optimize memory and

1122
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:43,120
processing requirements we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

1123
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:45,339
rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> any central authority to do</font>

1124
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,170
anything so as I talk further you'll see

1125
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,910
that what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing is a</font>

1126
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:53,170
distributed system it has implicit trust

1127
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:55,810
in it we don't want to rely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on ever rely</font>

1128
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:59,020
on routing to secure routing what I mean

1129
00:51:55,810 --> 00:52:03,310
there is if I have to go someplace using

1130
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:06,070
my pcp routes to verify that my BP rocks

1131
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,870
are secure it kind of creates a circle

1132
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:08,220
of

1133
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:10,100
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> someplace without</font>

1134
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:14,339
verification that the route to get there

1135
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:15,990
essentially valid we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

1136
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:19,410
and i'm sure everyone wants it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1137
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:22,350
incremental deployed part of importance

1138
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:25,250
here is that if it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> incremental you're</font>

1139
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:27,930

some type<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security to the parts of</font>

1151
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:05,180
today we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are 25,000</font>

or less over the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of slides</font>

1156
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,840
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to just summarize what we do</font>

1157
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:23,670
you verify that the originator is in

1158
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:26,610
fact authorized to originate a path

1159

toward about we can verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font>

1160

path represents a valid path to that

1161
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:34,170
origin what we do is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one</font>

security message this is not an

1164
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:43,230
attribute it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message so this means</font>

1165
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:46,890
is it's carried separate from the

1166
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:49,170
updates and it can result as I'll say a

1167
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,750
couple times later again can result in

1168
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:54,270
you having a BGP session that only

1169
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:56,910
carries updates or a session that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

1170
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:59,220
carries security information or a

00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:01,140
session carries both the point here is

1172
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:03,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we want to carry the certificate</font>

1173
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:05,910
and security information inside the

1174
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:09,509
protocol itself so that again you'll

1175
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:11,350
have to rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> external sources to get</font>

we it has fixed additional skill builder

1178
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:19,990
requirements the certificates and

1179
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:22,870
security information is generated once

1180
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:26,350
per entity or call entities and Tom

trust relationship Lucy associations etc

1187
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:48,070
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will we're proposing it where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

trust to validate the signatures from

enema syringe whatever I want there are

1193
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:05,170
three certificates that we have the fine

1194
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:10,060
so far the entity certificate which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1195
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:12,210
used to establish the identity so this

00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font>

1197

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information the kick that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1199
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:22,029
number 109 etc the authorization to

<font color="#CCCCCC">that a specific autonomous system is in</font>

fact authorized to advertise specific

1204
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:34,480
prefix usually this is going to be

1205
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:37,510
signed by someone who has authority over

1206
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,430
that prefix again<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp registry you know</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">whoever you want who are you trust and</font>

1208
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:43,118
then there's a policy certificate we're

1209
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,599
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this certificate for a</font>

1213
00:55:52,240 --> 00:56:00,609
and the other one is if the origin wants

1214
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:03,340
to apply specific policies to their

1215
00:56:00,609 --> 00:56:05,380
block or specific prefix they can they

1216
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:08,200
can announce those policies in here and

1217
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:10,270
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course sign the policies and make</font>

them secure some policies may be things

1219
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,290
like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have his last 16 and the</font>

1221

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> spook the origin could</font>

1223

advertise anything bigger than a session

for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example and again we're</font>

1225
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:30,770
proposing your<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

1226

as a method to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and last but not</font>

00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned you can propagate updates or</font>

00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:43,090
propagating the propagation of them so

1231
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't overload routers with</font>

transport the certificates all this all

1239
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,460
the security message is is a set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> T</font>

if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> later it also means you can</font>

1245
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:23,720
only see the certificates that you need

every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you exchange this information</font>

1247
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,450
with it appears you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to get</font>

1248
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,730
everything again you can only get some

of them and the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> point on there</font>

which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've known I know I've said</font>

1251
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:37,099
several times but it's important is you

1252
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:39,170
can have certificate only update only or

1253
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:41,630
both sessions of course everything is

1254

negotiated start up with capability as

1255
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:44,410
everything else

1256
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:52,440
the important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of other security</font>

1257
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:55,589
message is there is no information

additional processing need or storage

1260
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:03,359
for anyone receiving an update even

1261
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:07,380
though<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is secured by smtp because the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of my one slide that explains the whole</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">what we start with is a set of no keys</font>

1268
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,460

validate<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the known key it's a</font>

signature essentially valid and in there

1271
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:34,320
you of course have identity of other

1272
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,290
assets and their keys as well so your

1273

table of keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> said it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rose positive</font>

carried apology information and what

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a list of other a SS that you're</font>

00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:05,069
it just guesses so this goes into what

we call its<font color="#E5E5E5"> Polly database which later</font>

00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:28,049
people implicitly withdrawal routes by

1293

1294
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,540
down and my SP turns out to be a bad guy

1295
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:38,310
and they keep advertising my

between the authorization database and

applied to addresses that are announced

that are authorized to be announced and

1329
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:18,740
example of some deployment scenario this

<font color="#E5E5E5">is a simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and when trend to</font>

1331
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:23,240
illustrate is the 707 problem so the

1332
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,680
problem was 70 servers have been d

1333
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,080
aggregated everything back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1334
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,149
venture so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happened was</font>

1335
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:32,569
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aggregated in announced</font>

1336
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:33,800
stuff as originated from them the way s

1337
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:37,330
what we should be prevents this is very

1338
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:40,220
simple version of the routes is now 707

1339
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:42,680
authorization tificate say nope they are

1340
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,740
not the ones authorized to do this so we

1341
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">can just get rid of a lot of much</font>

1342
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,609
another possibility which wasn't what

1343
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,050
happened but could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have happened is</font>

1344
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:54,380
let's say that 70 serve seven in fact

1345
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:57,200
announced an<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS path of the origin and</font>

1346
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,850
then themselves so that when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

1347
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> databases we find out oh yeah the</font>

1348
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:04,250
origin is authorized to announce this

1349
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:05,750
but when we verify the path the path is

1350
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:08,200
not valid because there is no link

1351
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:12,080
between the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and seven six or so</font>

1352
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:14,080
so that gets blocked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first hop is</font>

1353
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:17,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">V another thing that could have happened</font>

1354
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:20,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can also protect against is the</font>

1355
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:22,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact let's say that 707 was actually</font>

1356
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:24,410
multihomed and that they just kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1357
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,300
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> last path and propagated the</font>

01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:29,359
information back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the multi home is B</font>

1359
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:31,940
which are called SPM so the AAS path is

1360
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,450
the same as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original one that they</font>

1361
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:36,180
received

1362
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:38,160
which means we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can verify the path you</font>

1363
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:40,680
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also verify the origin so here's</font>

where some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the functionality of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things we can do here one of them is</font>

1367
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:51,930
there is a bit indication in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the policy</font>

non transit a yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I speaking for the</font>

1370
01:02:54,390 --> 01:03:00,060
customers do they want to the other

1371
01:02:56,099 --> 01:03:03,990
option is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't include that</font>

1372
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:07,740
connection in your topology information

1373
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:11,459
that prevents the autonomous system from

1374
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:13,589
transiting your rounds so if I was an

1375
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:16,920
ISP I would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not want many of my</font>

1376
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:17,880
routes to go through my customers cable

1377
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,680
customers for example or you know

1378
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,500
anything else the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way that this</font>

1379
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,348
can be prevented is knowing this was the

1380
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:27,240
aggregation problem is by the origin

1381
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:29,640
advertising a policy that says I'm only

1382
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,990
advertising stunt sixteens if you got

1383
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,828
anything bigger than that even if it's

1384
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:33,828
from me Norton

1385
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:41,190
so what do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run SWV versus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> V</font>

1386
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:43,650

1387
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:47,280
generate certificates very similar to

01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:49,310
what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie needs we need of course</font>

the code for iOS one of the goals here

1404
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:39,939
because of the offload processing and

1405
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:41,109
the fact that we don't need to

let me just throw one summary up and

1421
01:05:23,089 --> 01:05:31,390
then let's do the questions then I think

1422
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:34,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are concerned about lunch</font>

1423
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:37,970
needless to say there things that I

1424
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:39,619
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both protocols suck those</font>

1425
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:50,180
who know<font color="#CCCCCC"> me wouldn't be surprised by</font>

1426
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:53,089
this but I do think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

1427
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:56,029
and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from both of them I</font>

1428
01:05:53,089 --> 01:06:00,920
won't really go into what I think sucks

1429
01:05:56,030 --> 01:06:05,359
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> each of them but let me in said</font>

1430
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:08,809
instead suggest what I might like to

1431
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:13,038
steal from<font color="#CCCCCC"> each of them and this is my</font>

1432
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:16,039
personal view<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the big costs in all</font>

1433
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:22,490
this are going to be my deployment my

1434
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:25,279
operational costs not what Aaron's going

1435
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:28,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to do to sign something or the</font>

1436
01:06:25,279 --> 01:06:31,660
cost of a little hardware in the round

1437
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:34,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay full deployment is going to take</font>

1438
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:38,440
years but I don't want to do is get

1439
01:06:34,839 --> 01:06:40,480
caught out okay that's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1440
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:43,030
hard to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my management three</font>

1441
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:46,170
years from now when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have serious</font>

1442
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:50,619
internet outages to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP problems or</font>

1443
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:54,069
next month when we have the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7007 or</font>

1444
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:56,470
whatever why I'm not doing anything why

1445
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:59,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I didn't already do something about this</font>

1446
01:06:56,470 --> 01:07:02,950
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared to do something okay</font>

1447
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:06,098
the deployment we can do now is the

1448
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:09,098
beginning of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> certificate creation</font>

1449
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:11,790
and distribution and that it comes in

1450
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:14,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">two parts it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address allocation</font>

1451
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:16,390
certificates in other words the registry

1452
01:07:14,589 --> 01:07:18,130
gives it to an is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1453
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:22,180
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are signed certificates</font>

1454
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:25,200
and there's the pier certificates hey I

1455
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:28,419
trust Dave Dave trust andrew et cetera I

1456
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:33,430
believe those are two different trust

1457
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:37,780
models both both can use the same flavor

1458
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:40,720
of certificate it's how the attestation

1459
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:43,300
chain of the certificates are done I

1460
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:46,180
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> the piers are really more like</font>

1461
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:50,350
PGP and the

1462
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:53,470
address allocation is a hierarchy and i

1463
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:55,180
believe the hardware support we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

1464
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:59,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">for our vendors to start throwing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1473
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:36,810
those prefixes are allocated now

1474
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:44,759
I believe we can start building trust

1475
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:47,368
relationships with our peers I am

1476
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the hardware now it's</font>

1479
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:59,069
thousand for you know i can afford that

1480
01:08:56,330 --> 01:09:01,049
tenth of a percent increment so

1481
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:03,409
management doesn't string me up three

1482
01:09:01,049 --> 01:09:08,189
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn it on</font>

1483
01:09:03,408 --> 01:09:12,330
ok but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I most care about is that I</font>

1484
01:09:08,189 --> 01:09:14,460
have one planned protocol path and not

1485
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:16,049
something I'm going to do this year and

1486
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:18,448
then I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to do something</font>

1487
01:09:16,049 --> 01:09:21,769
more three years and now when I realize

1488
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:21,769
the threat is bigger

1489
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:29,189
somebody else have their prejudices

1490
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:37,370
Steve will hunt again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the kind of</font>

1491
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,890
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with what you're saying what can</font>

1492
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:41,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do now as it currently stands does</font>

1493
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:43,820
registries that you can register out

1494
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:45,649
soon people aren't doing it as it

1495
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:46,939
currently stands everybody could

1496
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:48,710
register their<font color="#E5E5E5"> outs and everyone could</font>

1497
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:50,359
do prefix filtering on their customers

1498
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:52,399
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers and they could validate that</font>

1499
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:54,589
every route that you receive is still

1500
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,940
somewhere even<font color="#CCCCCC"> without the pki and all</font>

1501
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:58,190
that kind of stuff we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

1502
01:09:55,940 --> 01:10:00,379
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now what you</font>

1503
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:04,009
know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can push on that today without</font>

1504
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:06,860
having to update the technology I can't

1505
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:09,230
validate large peers with based on

1506
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:11,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">rabbiting registry data do routers won't</font>

1507
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:15,799
handle it but the routers will handle

1508
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:20,900
this I believe they will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to yes</font>

1509
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:24,460
actually when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually look at for</font>

1510
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:28,339
instance s bgp you will find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

1511
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:31,640
in computation is merely the crypto load

1512
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:35,660
especially with signing forward and the

1513
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:37,910
chips are commodity junk now so so ten

1514
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:40,430
years ago ANS did enter provider route

1515
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:42,889
filtering and the headache was that that

1516
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:44,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">you got you had to wait there wasn't a</font>

1517
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:45,440
route refreshed show you you know

1518
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,850
mechanism so you had to bounce around

1519
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">you had a void on a registry of the</font>

1520
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">update today we have incremental access</font>

1521
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:54,200
lists we have route refresh you have you

1522
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,060
know i mean the missing part to every

1523
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,250
one of these solutions is some central

1524
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:00,770
authority or r AR or someone to delegate

1525
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:01,460
and say this network owns this prefix

1526
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:03,710
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're you know they're</font>

1527
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:05,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">authoritative for it if you have that</font>

1528
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:07,670
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Inter provider out filtering it</font>

1529
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:10,010
fixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> 99% of the problems that you know</font>

1530
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:12,010
that would have rise and we could do

1531
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:14,060
that today without any new hardware I

1532
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:16,440
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the new hardware is the</font>

1533
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:19,290
problem i think it's the infrastructure

1534
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:21,419
or the deployment costs yes and that's

1535
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:23,910
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be two orders of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> magnitude</font>

1536
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:25,800
larger for sob GP or SVG p<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font>

1537
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:28,199
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great if this were deployed but</font>

1538
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,580
my point is that we don't have md5 we

1539
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:32,429
don't have enter provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> route filters</font>

1540
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:36,750
and those alone would fix a very very

1541
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:38,670
large piece of this problem yep but it's

1542
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to fix all of it yeah now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1543
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know 99 percent of the</font>

1544
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:44,540
problem is better than nothing so

1545
01:11:47,659 --> 01:11:53,509
Jeff<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schiller again what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually</font>

1546
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:56,239
can do with which all the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font>

1547
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:58,729
you know things cannot do is this can be

1548
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:02,780
forced on us and that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

1549
01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:05,479
thing right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't force an ISP to</font>

01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:08,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">set passwords on their routers I cannot</font>

1551
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:11,900
force an ISP<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use halfway decent than</font>

1552
01:12:08,329 --> 01:12:15,829
to do md5 keying on bgp sessions I can't

1553
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:18,438
control beyond my peers and myself but

1554
01:12:15,829 --> 01:12:21,619
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand I can choose to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

1555
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:24,769
accept sign routes now obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1556
01:12:21,619 --> 01:12:26,360
can't do that on day one but after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1557
01:12:24,769 --> 01:12:28,849
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been available and the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure has been available some</font>

01:12:31,249 --> 01:12:39,369
providers can say effective date x we

1561
01:12:35,389 --> 01:12:41,599
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> only accept signed routes and</font>

1562
01:12:39,369 --> 01:12:43,239
that's something you can do with this

1563
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:47,269
you can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with any of the other</font>

1564
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:50,509
technologies that are out there it won't

1565
01:12:47,269 --> 01:12:51,679
be fun so to that actually I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1566
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:53,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">how many service provider or how many</font>

1567
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,249
folks in here have worked for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a service</font>

1568
01:12:53,449 --> 01:12:56,570
vadra's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop for each ability of</font>

1569
01:12:55,249 --> 01:12:59,239
those destinations but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1570
01:12:56,570 --> 01:13:01,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a flag day like this actually even</font>

1571
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:03,199
you know remotely realistic because

1572
01:13:01,249 --> 01:13:04,969
people you know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> their revenue</font>

1573
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:06,739
and real income associated with that and

1574
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:07,939
that's what keeps those companies

1575
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:10,039
running so that's not that's not

1576
01:13:07,939 --> 01:13:11,900
feasible and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and real</font>

1577
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:13,699
outflow for dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

1578
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:15,829
breaches and support when things break

1579
01:13:13,699 --> 01:13:18,228
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it's that's going to be a tough</font>

1580
01:13:15,829 --> 01:13:19,999
call we're years away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from even being in</font>

1581
01:13:18,229 --> 01:13:24,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">a position to decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to make</font>

1582
01:13:19,999 --> 01:13:27,919
that call what's likely to happen sooner

1583
01:13:24,169 --> 01:13:33,110
is some group of customers will only

1584
01:13:27,919 --> 01:13:36,019
deal with a collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ISPs</font>

1585
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:39,530
that have adequate routing security

1586
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:41,929
because they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal they want to</font>

1587
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:47,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> places they want to get</font>

1588
01:13:41,929 --> 01:13:48,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">to our the right places I don't know if</font>

1589
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:51,050
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the flag day but I</font>

1590
01:13:48,619 --> 01:13:53,659
can say yes this is a route I can trust

1591
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:56,570
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> following attributes that</font>

1592
01:13:53,659 --> 01:14:00,530
I can see on my bgp speaking router and

1593
01:13:56,570 --> 01:14:04,330
my ends on my customer premises this is

1594
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:04,330
your router without security

1595
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:12,929
