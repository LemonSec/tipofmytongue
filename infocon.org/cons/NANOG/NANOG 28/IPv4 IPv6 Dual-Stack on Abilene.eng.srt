us when you see it in the hallways just

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,620
service the ipv6 service has no AUP so

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
we can accept commercial entities or

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,489
commercial peers and that's actually

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,250
provided some interesting problems for

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,589
us one of the things we've tried to do

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,059
is to have our ipv4 and ipv6 filters

23
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,090
exactly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same we use the same filter</font>

come to play here a little later when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,340
start discussing the fun

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Abilene in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past has only had a /</font>

with when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we brought up these six a new</font>

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,610
problem arose and that's was a signing

32
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,729
address space we've never done this

33
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,990
before there's some administrative

34
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,070
overhead and there's some technical

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,300
overhead related to aggregation we<font color="#CCCCCC"> spent</font>

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,369
thought we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good job and then a</font>

year went by and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out that we</font>

42
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,880
enough for growth we'd run out of

43
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,950

/ forties and / 48 for their networks

50
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,200
and so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some dns delegation</font>

duties there and again that's not

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,500
something that we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about</font>

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,269
in the past and that's not something we

give you a brief overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our ebgp</font>

62
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,920

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:50,299
working away it should one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,510
interesting ideas here is since most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

65
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:57,709
our customers only have a single vendor

providing them ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> us technically we</font>

67
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to run bgp with them we could</font>

00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:03,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">just use static routes but we use bgp to</font>

69
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:07,489
in order to gain a bit more experience

70
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">with e fix bgp we accept any prefix from</font>

71
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:11,389
our peering networks and that causes

72
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:14,090
problems as you'll see later with

73
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:17,989

75
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:24,260
internally and only pass / 16 / 32 s to

76

our peers and customers that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

77
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,679
cause problems also and I have a slide

78
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:30,988
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's very interesting</font>

our policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the tunnels are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

80
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,819
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact the tunnel router has</font>

81
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:38,510
been quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem for us and</font>

82
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,649
we'll go a little more detail on that

83
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,599
finally when I say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we accept any</font>

84
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">peer from pure networx that the prefix</font>

85
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,290
from pure network that's not technically

86
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,649
correct we do of course apply a sanity

87
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,650
filter

88
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:56,210
one of the interesting aspects of adding

89
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:58,850
v6 to your network is your igp we were

90
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,220
running ospf as our<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp and of course</font>

91
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovered that that would not do for v6</font>

92
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,830
since we needed as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> GV that supported</font>

93
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:11,240
it that meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> Isis and that means</font>

94
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:14,240
deploying Isis in at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we</font>

95
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,790
were running ospf at that time there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

96
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">a problem you could not simply run Isis</font>

99
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:25,640
your distances and preferences in order

100
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,480
to make ospf to preferred protocol for

101
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,520
ospf or must be at the protocol for

102
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,250
before and Isis the preferred protocol

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,080
for be six I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ensuing year</font>

104
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,670
or so that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this I don't</font>

105
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe that alimentation anymore i</font>

106
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:44,630
believe you can run Isis with just v6

107
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:47,000
support if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> shouldn't so choose</font>

108
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,030
we actually encountered the only routing

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,060
loop I have ever seen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life during</font>

112
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:02,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I caused it after we deployed both ospf</font>

113
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,580
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Isis we fiddled with the metrics</font>

114
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,760
after about six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and made Isis for</font>

115
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,909
protocol for v4 and then finally removed

116
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,849
ospf those two steps were actually very

117
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,440
painless they worked without any

118
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,930
problems at all most of our problems

119
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,890
were involved with both running ospf and

120
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:26,590
Isis with one protocol preferred for one

see a net is diverted over that slow

faster direct<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection this can be a</font>

00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,480
problem and we see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem mostly</font>

212
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,920
in tunnels the tunnel connections are of

213
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,380
course significantly slower than our

214
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,760
native connections and if it's

215
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,560
misconfigured in a native connection

216
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,480
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a problem since in smart</font>

217
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,880
connections at this point roc 12 are

218
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,160
higher but when we receive these

219
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,880
prefixes over the tunnels things slowed

220
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,880
down dramatically

221
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,500
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a my routing you how I like</font>

222
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,209
to call the slide you'll notice the

slides with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> distance and preference</font>

224
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,670

internal and external routes for cisco's

226
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:28,319
and junipers and one thing in particular

227
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:31,930
I'd like to point out is the level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,210

229
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:41,969
level two internal preference and if you

230
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the ISIS and if you look at the</font>

232
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,529

235

241
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:16,240
make it lower than that Isis preference

242
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,340
on every router we had that someone

243
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,350

244
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,590
we were redistributing are connected

245
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:27,980
routes into ospf because we weren't

246
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:32,480
using the next-hop cells so our route to

247
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:35,330
our peers was an igp learned route we

248
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,070
had a case where the new york route

249
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,860
ourselves the best route<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of our</font>

259
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:09,829
the few cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> where our v6 experiments</font>

260
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,000
actually affected our before traffic and

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,000
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quite serious</font>

262
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:19,180
we had another case where 36

263
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,400
experimentation caused before problems

264
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 people cross paths</font>

265
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,650
so it's right when we had first switched

266
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:30,640
over from ospf to Isis this is our stage

267

<font color="#CCCCCC">2 we were just using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Isis through some</font>

268
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,689

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,870
the metrics on the backbone and we're

270
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:41,110
only setting level two metrics we had

271
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,120
not turned off level<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so even though</font>

279
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,800
there's really no one to play here

280

except ourselves the lesson<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn</font>

281
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,939
from this is to explicitly set your

288
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,430
and lots of collisions and ipv6

289
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,890

316
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:41,600
10 4 well if you convert that v4 address

317
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,089
into a v6 address especially 2001 468

318
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,370
but we had happening was that our v6

319
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:49,470
petitions for passing v4 routes across

320
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:54,120
them and the next cops was being

321
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:56,970
translated into from a v6 address to the

322
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,510
first 32 bits of it was being translated

323
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:02,550
into a before address some was fun it's

324
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:05,579
also really obvious is really easy to

325
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:09,870
fix again sloppy can fix cause to this

326
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:13,109
we had not<font color="#E5E5E5"> been turning protocols on and</font>

off explicitly in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP to fix we had</font>

330
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,089
we've done a code upgrade and the code

331
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,490
had changed them and again the lesson

332
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:24,810
learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to explicitly set which</font>

338
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,920
course if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a point-to-point</font>

339
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,319

340
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,780
one end and the e4 address on the other

341

342
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:48,150
you have problems but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

345

346
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,430
subnets may be different on the two

347
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,170
interfaces that's not actually a problem

348
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,540
the router is actually smarter than you

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">are it knows what the link local</font>

356
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,690

357
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,850
and no one knew about it traffic routed

358
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,710
perfectly it wasn't until<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

359

checking our<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS records just to make</font>

sure we had everything in the dns that

we discovered the problem it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,630
really a problem

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:43,459
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a basic v6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pgp issue</font>

364
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that your v6 router has to</font>

365

network in terms of b6 traffic and the

424
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,030
old days you just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> added fee for</font>

425
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,080
address on the interface and you knew

426
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,910
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much traffic there was on the</font>

just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to skip the next minute and</font>

talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about our engineering group some of</font>

434
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:25,250
the engineers are actually very scared

435
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,659
Lisa they're very intimidated by the all

436
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,019
the FS and all the colons and all the

437
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:32,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">zeros there even as scared of v6 as they</font>

438
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:35,450
are multicast and that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't</font>

439
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:37,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">be the case but for some reason all</font>

440
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,630
those cones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really dig into</font>

441
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:42,320
them and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even want to think</font>

442
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:46,730
about visa lastly there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressing</font>

443
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,840
plan we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very bright and</font>

444
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,159
mathematician<font color="#E5E5E5"> had designed our</font>

445
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,820
addressing plan and we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

446
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:54,260
enough room for growth in it and we did

447
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,840
we've remembered the network three times

448
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,970
so far to try to add additional growth

449
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,799
and we're probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do at a</font>

450
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,360
fourth time the good news<font color="#CCCCCC"> is those</font>

451
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,529
remembering split without a plan they

452
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,820
took about an hour and there was

453
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:08,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely no downtime involved at all</font>

454
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,539
Sebastian says we're going to have read

455
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:12,919
every time my advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be have a</font>

456
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:15,170
very good addressing plan that allows

457
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,360
for growth

458
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,610
so the really other really big issues

459
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,790
which prefixes were going to pass our

460
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,260
peers in the v4 worlds might use meds to

461
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,000
influence an exit point on your network

462
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,750
well that was great because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had lots</font>

463
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,250
of c-4 routes with v6 you have one route

464
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:36,380
abilene has<font color="#E5E5E5"> one / 32 cNN has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one / 32</font>

465
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:39,680
how do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is best exit point</font>

466
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:42,140
from my network to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> caa2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Vancouver</font>

467
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,070

468
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:48,380
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just wanted to have a</font>

469
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,320
clarification oh I'm big Meyer so I did

470
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,060
hi I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wondering did you say your</font>

471
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,879
on your about on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your fourth addressing</font>

472
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,899
plan and that one of them are some

473
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,090
number of them are designed by

474
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,280
mathematicians did you say no yes I did

475
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,470
and there may be some causality relation

476
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:11,300
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the next one's on by a lawyer</font>

477
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:12,920
I'm just I'm just kind of curious um you

478
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,379
know we we've been around the addressing

479
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,780
plant in a while on the v4 space have we

480
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,270
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned anything or is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

481
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,830
qualitatively different harder are we

482
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,360
are we in a completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> different space</font>

483
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,389
or what's happening there because one

484
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,399
would imagine that if you had ipv4 and

485
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,720
you designed a successor<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of the</font>

486
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,320
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would handle is addressing</font>

487
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,570
that's right you know I I think the vast

488
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,120
amount of addresses combines with the

489
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:41,090
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of super aggregation is our problem</font>

490
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,639
here I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have learned</font>

491
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:47,459
anything from it

492
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:50,700
Emily um

493
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:55,620
Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bush iij I happen to be part of a</font>

dual stack e64 network live in Japan um

495
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:02,279
and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that my engineering</font>

496
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,960
people are right now taking these foils

497
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,960
and sending them to the marketing people

498
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,520
who've been complaining why we won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

499
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,020
gpp<font color="#E5E5E5"> rover tunnels and thank you for</font>

500
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,299
demonstrating why not to do it they're

501
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,490
very everything right um do you use

502
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:20,639
static rollo con for services and rather

503
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:23,190
interfaces do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use static addressing</font>

504
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,159
or autocom we use static addresses on

505
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:28,679
the renovation and for services and for

506
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">services yeah and by the way a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> router ID</font>

507
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,640
does not have to be an IP address if a

508
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:35,490
nigga dirty be it is it's something

509
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so I have a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">information here in that movie I'm sorry</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're I'm off well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going in as well</font>

512
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:46,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a minute Christopher we have all of</font>

513
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:48,539
our configs without passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> online and</font>

514
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,490
the rattle proxy so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

515
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:52,350
look at how we're doing things if you'd

516
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to probably the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to do that</font>

517
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,529
is through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> abilene router proxy to</font>

third URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> mls</font>

519
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:16,950
um I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Randy when you talk</font>

520
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:19,409
about the ghosts r us is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asp s</font>

521
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,090
normal on this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we saw was</font>

522
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:23,370
some of them somebody else's work<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented was that there was these</font>

524
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,610
routes that never<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to go away when</font>

00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:30,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're withdrawn in the ass past</font>

526
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:35,750
becomes this big long ugly huge thing is

527
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:38,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the same problem it's very similar</font>

528
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:41,100
had been in two of the cases we've

529
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,360
actually seen very long it had we

530
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,939
been filtering on the number of a of

531
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,939
Hopsin the AFF that<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably would have</font>

532
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,039
fixed the problem in one case that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

533
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,350
not happened so we had a very short ASM

534
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,789
it's got it okay have you seen well

535
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,820
anyway maybe we should talk offline

536
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:58,289
because maybe you haven't seen maybe you

537
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,360
could talk to the other guy and somebody

538
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:03,440
could actually figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the bug</font>

539
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,439
is that's causing that

540
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,049
thanks
