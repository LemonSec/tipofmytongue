1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,870
together we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be going through</font>

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">this afternoon one of the tools that we</font>

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,769
hope if you're not already deployed it

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,549
that you look at the point in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:17,720
network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sinkhole tool it's a</font>

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,160
technique that<font color="#E5E5E5"> isps various ISPs of</font>

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,519
deploying and using for all sorts<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,050
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> security purposes on the net</font>

9
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,729
this is part of a series that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing kinda like annual series where we</font>

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a real world isp security</font>

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,739
techniques and tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you</font>

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,809
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically deploy with any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,459
vendors equipment we keep it as as

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,660
neutral as possible as more of

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,820
techniques so the first one where Chris

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,559
Brian and I did with the unit

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,240
backscatter<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace back technique and all</font>

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,980
the techniques along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,620
and then our last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> kevin powell and</font>

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">i did with the cpe protection because of</font>

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,280
all the cpe break-ins were seen with

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,600
different routers and so now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do sinkholes for this morning so the</font>

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,250
objective with all these tutorials is to

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,690
communicate you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-world</font>

27
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,600
practices so these are things coming

28
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,160
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you than in Danny and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> connect our</font>

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,100
position<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with different</font>

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,190
providers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> isb security space we can</font>

31
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">gain from our peers kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

32
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,690
here's what we're doing dis providers

33
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,390
we're doing that provider and they

34
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:26,520
permit us to kind of generalize it and

35
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,900
express it here so so others can copy

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,970
what they're doing without knowing

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,979
exactly what they're doing or<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

38
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,190
who did this so we don't give away into

39
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,660
specific details so so here we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font>

40
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get everybody in sync with the with</font>

41
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sinkhole technique so what are</font>

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,150
sinkholes sinkholes are kind you can

43
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,250
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> equivalent as a network</font>

44
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,800
is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sectioning network that</font>

45
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,120
sucks down bad packets and then when you

46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,330
take those you take those bad packets

47
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,490
and you do things

48
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,490
you can analyze it you can

49
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,809
look at what sort of vac<font color="#CCCCCC"> scatters coming</font>

50
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,210
from it you can look at attacks in

51
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,369
progress you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take an attack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

52
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,899
hitting one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your customers that may</font>

53
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:10,869
be stressing out an aggregation router

54
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,840
and redirect it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinkhole and do</font>

55
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:15,239
your classification

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,400
mitigation technique off office and call

57
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,989
so it's kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a multi-purpose</font>

58
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,340
tool which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we get this Swiss</font>

59
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,709
Army knife expression for it because

60
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,060
we're finding our peers are coming up

61
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,050
and saying hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found this</font>

62
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,490
new idea that we can do

63
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,290
we found this other idea we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do the</font>

64
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,060
sinkhole so once people deployed it

65
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,920
they're finding more<font color="#E5E5E5"> more different</font>

66
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,870
types of uses for their situational

67
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,119
sometimes to do to their network or

68
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,530
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> comply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeremy and the ones who</font>

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,290
are plenty of everyone we try to apply

70
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:45,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">here in this presentation so give a kid</font>

71
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,060
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> general journal scenarios</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

72
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,790
an aggregation router

73
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,209
when customs

74
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,909
see one customer

75
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,060
going to happen

76
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,060
here you got to go on that ride

77
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,459
I really something I never now

78
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,380
other customers on there<font color="#CCCCCC"> but them</font>

79
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,380
your logins around

80
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,049
so what to do at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinkhole as you</font>

81
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,049
take the / 32

82
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,780
sinkhole now you got the traffic going

83
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,860
off to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side to a part of your</font>

84
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">network</font>

85
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">or get from</font>

86
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,980
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

87
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,670
now the customer that

88
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,670
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being hit here</font>

89
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,640
fold at 45 negative it's off to the side

90
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,640
guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

91
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,150
rest of his<font color="#E5E5E5"> address space</font>

92
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,108
/ there was being

93
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:25,758
she was

94
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,758
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Restless last 24</font>

95
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,590
das is still in action but

96
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,929
you got more tools available to you

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,388
traffic away

98
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,729
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people use indoors</font>

99
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,729
watch your<font color="#CCCCCC"> network scan</font>

100
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,340
placement

101
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,900
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> place many people start</font>

102
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,970
primarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go at once</font>

103
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,490
in a place in your network that's not

104
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,039
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different techniques</font>

105
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:05,039
and the multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

106
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,910
so you can deploy the sinkholes widely

107
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,909
across your network

108
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,760
so why go through this

109
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,000
we'll say I just draw

110
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,250
this attack a black hole

111
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,248
JCP donk

112
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:56,489
scuse me back

113
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,470
and more useless being found

114
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:10,770
what we mind as equals

115
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,770
worms as we saw us

116
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:20,699
something that no

117
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,698
oh I got an incredible

118
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,130
we got a worm<font color="#CCCCCC"> that propagates around</font>

119
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:43,060
we're buying the sinkholes are very

120
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:43,060
powerful

121
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:50,870
um

122
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,920
so just to give some clarification of

123
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,920
why we call this a sinkhole

124
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,689
the black hole routers right

125
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,450
so sinkhole goes beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to see cold</font>

126
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:24,529
Tar Pits are places in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vice</font>

127
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,339
connections

128
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:27,339
will you put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sink hole</font>

129
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,169
our shots

130
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,110
we can wonder sing long you're not going

131
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,250
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing of money</font>

132
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,900
much water turn you have all these

133
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,900
things inside

134
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,359
Swiss Army knife spoon

135
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,939
so um now

136
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,939
and over to Danny

137
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,760
and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you</font>

138
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,990
anyone you want to ask a question

139
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,990
I'm going to run my

140
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,900
right so basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

141
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,770
right so expand

142
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,310
is you know how much traffic decent in

143
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,310
SC colon you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really here</font>

144
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,130
for a single so

145
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,660
to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much traffic you've</font>

146
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,860
actually got in prefixes you want to

147
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,800
monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something you should be aware</font>

148
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,170
of

149
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,550
one of the things as well is that you

150
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want routers generating tons of</font>

151
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,000
unreachable messages that sort of thing

152
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,589
if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> house</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes down so you can put a</font>

153
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,260
static arp on it you know kind of like a

154
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:31,410
shiny just put a static arp entry on a

155
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,329
router to get rid of to get rid of you

156
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,829
know the unreachable stuff that kind of

157
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,420
thing if your box goes down you can

158
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:38,489
still for the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the Lana it</font>

159
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,640
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or send a lot of</font>

160
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:44,270
garbage back out of the network so

161
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright what's monitoring a sinkhole</font>

162
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:50,250
dark eye peas the dark ipd is kind of

163
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty pretty broad term and the</font>

164
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,670
common definition for that I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

165
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,160
there is one is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bogan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

166
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,229

either hasn't been allocated aura it

169
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,030
wasn't used or or you know the RFC 1918

170
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,410
those sorts of things off and you know

171
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,850
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do by you know by watching</font>

172
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,500
this address space that you should be

173
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,720
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful because you again the</font>

this address spaces

176
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,300
is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than most people expect so so</font>

177
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,620
you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware of you know of how</font>

178
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">much you want to modern start small</font>

179
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,100
either with you know an allocated

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,780
backbone or infrastructure links that

181
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,060
sort of thing or an allocated customer

182
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,100
prefixes or you know we're just don't

183
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,739
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the RC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1980 prefixes</font>

184
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,410
that sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor</font>

185
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,370
again you can monitor backscatter

186
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,990
backscatter from attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to talk</font>

187
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,210
about Beckwith backscatter is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in just a</font>

188
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,310
moment if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not aware dark IP stuff</font>

189
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,870
you know who's scanning so just by

190
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,310
putting one IP address there i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

191
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,650
have one IP address on one of my home

192
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,239
subnets that I monitor and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing</font>

193
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,010
actually how many how many scans you see

194
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,990
the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know random scans and</font>

195
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,640
the other probably compromised hosts

196
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,320
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are scanning looking for some</font>

197
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,770
ex-boyfriend so you can you can get a

198
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,770
handle on<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

199
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,130
alright so monitor scan rates is you

200
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,810
know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are lots of tools to do this</font>

201
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,130
I work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> are over and meet our company</font>

202
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,479
has it totally does some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but</font>

203
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,820
there's a ton<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there that's</font>

204
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,470
free that does this as well and you know

205
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,730
to you know to get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place</font>

206
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,170
and free and start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your small</font>

207
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,730
sinkhole actually understand what's

208
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,589
going on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network and you can</font>

209
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,720
idea about what's happening is kind of

210
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal here I guess that's what</font>

211
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,390
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get across is to even be</font>

212
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,940
prepared to understand what's happening

213
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,800
and work so

214
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is this is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

215
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,319
screenshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> from some of our stuff when a</font>

216
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,610
worm actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows a list of infected</font>

217
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,110
hose down at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

218
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,700
actually see a huge bike there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

219
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,810
was from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sinkhole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if your mind as</font>

220
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,150
you can say whoa look at that you know

221
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,680
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the average rate above what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

222
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,380
expected for this interface or this

223
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,670
device or this prefix went up and and

224
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,020
you know here's a list of all the hosts

225
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,490
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're scanning this prefix so</font>

226
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,020
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably all compromised or</font>

227
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,280
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been affected by this worm or</font>

228
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,660
whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that happened you can</font>

229
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,400
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure it out first</font>

230
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,930
just assuming that there's a bunch of

231
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,250
noise on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network that day and you</font>

232
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,229
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and discarding it because it will</font>

233
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,710
grow so

234
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:05,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright monitoring backscatter</font>

235
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,940
me actually he<font color="#E5E5E5"> really let me talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

236
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,650
backscattering real quick vs so what you

237
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,540
see here is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

238
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,490
where the term backscatter actually came

239
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,630
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm guessing that indicator used it</font>

240
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,610
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if it came from</font>

241
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,410
elsewhere but it's what you see in this

242
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,050
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is a couple of packets</font>

243
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,600
with sous<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spoof source addresses here</font>

244
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,670
and so they're hitting some victim in

245
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,470
this case this is the big demand and

246
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,209
then the victims replying back to you

247
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,890
know VT and see in this case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

248
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's units that someone referred to as</font>

249
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,340
backscatter it can also come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you</font>

250
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,500
know router and reachable messages or

251
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,760
you know a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and it's</font>

252
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,200
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the backscatter that we're</font>

253
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,939
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you can get a handle</font>

254
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,470
on on you know where that<font color="#CCCCCC"> data is going</font>

255
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to and watch that you can get a</font>

256
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,510
good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know what's</font>

257
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,510
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

258
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,380
the song get you at home<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay 11</font>

259
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:57,060
you put backscatter inside your network

260
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:59,459
is and you only monitor say like you

261
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,029
know say say if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take your router</font>

262
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:05,069
your sink holes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put your all</font>

263
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:08,130
your AG you use it as your black hole

264
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:10,050
generators for your<font color="#CCCCCC"> home for your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

265
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,850
advertisement so you take all your your

266
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,229
site or aggregate blocks and just stick

267
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,350
them on your sink holes and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

268
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,670
watch the backscatter and one it one of

269
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,620
the providers this is how they kind of

270
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,689
get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> early indication of which of the</font>

271
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,490
customers being attacked because they

272
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,160
see only the backscatter from their

273
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,110
network you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from all the networks</font>

274
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,480
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide to them and that will give</font>

275
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,040
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> an indication k which my customers</font>

276
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">are getting hit which customers get</font>

277
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,689
ready to call me and and and this one

278
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,209
guy said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know it's really fun</font>

279
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,100
sometimes to have the customer call the

280
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:42,569
escalator chances oh yes hey how you

281
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,610
doing I understand you're under attack

282
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,350
right now I can see it on my monitor

283
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,589
right now listen let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and plug</font>

284
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,269
this up you know it<font color="#CCCCCC"> helps you getting</font>

285
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">more proactive mode with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the customers</font>

286
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:54,840
that way

287
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,600
so backscatter is pretty pretty nice

288
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,560
tool which<font color="#E5E5E5"> only if you set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up then</font>

289
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,790
yeah we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have a couple of</font>

290
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,839
examples on how you do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your</font>

291
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,839
aggregates<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a moment</font>

292
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,740
anyway that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kata stuff you know</font>

293
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,480
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there and look at some of the</font>

294
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,500
analysis and the other thing they did on

295
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,140
backscatter it's actually pretty

296
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,030
interesting and the the backscatter you

297
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,180
know the traceback stuff to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris and</font>

298
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rob and yes Brian Greene Jim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pony and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

299
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,839
few other folks from real calm and

300
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,760
elsewhere did and they presented I think

301
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,870
the trauma<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all gets still still</font>

302
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,520
online so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and</font>

303
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you know if it</font>

304
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,060
makes more sense now that's something

305
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,540
you ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

306
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,000
on my side

307
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:35,209
my name's been framed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,860
just a sample<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an account accounting</font>

309
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,018
be a packet filter is looking at some

310
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,970
address ranges right so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is yeah</font>

311
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,769
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is Jeff Jeff one out one</font>

312
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,149
time there's this was actually cut paste

313
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,940
with a net on discussion whether it was

314
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:49,250
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our discussion about how many spoofed</font>

315
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,730
addresses in bogan space are there

316
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">really out there</font>

317
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,930
you know and have disliked packets so he

318
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,850
had some router somewhere in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

319
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,120
and you just did a classification<font color="#CCCCCC"> kcl</font>

320
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:02,550
which was all permits and all denies in

321
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,140
this one this is denied case and he just

322
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,459
you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all source addresses</font>

323
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,660
out of the Dogon space and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

324
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how many how many is out there</font>

325
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,620
they were out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there in silicon counters</font>

326
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,900
and he was like surprised over his

327
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:16,319
network but there were that many spoofed

328
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:19,410
bogan addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care on his</font>

329
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,089
network it didn't think there was any by

330
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,980
the way Barry did most of these slides

331
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,589
and gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to me about an hour and a</font>

332
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,760
half ago so it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some</font>

333
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:31,010
of them better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I do and that's</font>

334
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,010
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I said all right so uh</font>

335
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so now I'm to sinkholes and</font>

336
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet-facing and what this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

337
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,900
looks like what you see here is okay so

338
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,250
common<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess that you know the current</font>

339
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">practice of service fighters is to</font>

340
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,480
announce your network aggregates only

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,160
the you know the moat the most are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,990
longest or the shortest prefix I'm sorry

343
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,420
to announce the shortest prefix for your

344
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,100
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> dagger</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's and only one and an</font>

347
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">and and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that does is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any of</font>

348
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,660
the unallocated address space within

349
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,830
that block ends up getting dumped on

350
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,360
your router and your router's got to

351
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,500
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so that's that's what</font>

352
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,439
you're seeing here is you see large

353
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,390
large cider block is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a as being</font>

354
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,430
announced and all the garbage packets

355
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know to either scans or you know</font>

356
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,270
we're back scatter or whatever is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

357
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,650
being sent to your router just tossed

358
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,970
and you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze that data</font>

359
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,480
since you're carrying it on your network

360
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,740
anyway so that's what this is getting

361
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,440
there's actually

362
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so so it wasn't a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal you</font>

363
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,220
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of noise that you saw the</font>

364
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,900
backscatter and the random scans and

365
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,309
that sort of thing when<font color="#E5E5E5"> now when there</font>

366
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,290
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten host somewhere that someone</font>

367
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,300
manually compromised but you know with

368
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,580
with botnets or using these zombie

369
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,860
networks that have 150,000 nodes and all

370
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,389
of them have you can make dsl access or

371
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,580
something this work becomes a lot more

372
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,960
significant so you know to just throw

373
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,699
that stuff in a router and fill<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a</font>

374
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,110
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> link in your network or a couple</font>

375
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,910
of links in your network and you know it

376
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,040
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> out or you know if they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

377
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,140
do unreachable<font color="#CCCCCC"> zorro macro replies</font>

378
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,639
whatever the whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack you</font>

379
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,990
know characteristics are if they can

380
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,030
respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> those or handle those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

381
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware well you know when the volume</font>

382
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,540
goes way up the you know the overhead on

383
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,860
your router in your network and you know

384
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,610
and your service availability are

385
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:14,669
impacted so so one of the things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

386
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,290
do actually is is spread out take some

387
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,330
of those unallocated blocks and actually

388
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,889
throw them on you know into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene</font>

389
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">kohli or some or all of them you know</font>

390
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,240
depend on the volume of traffic and what

391
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,000
you want to handle and so that's that's

392
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,130
what you're seeing here and basically I

393
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess hang on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm all series</font>

394
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,790
so so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull in you know certain</font>

395
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,250
certain allocated prefixes certain

396
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,629
blocks from the from from your aggregate

397
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,530
from the network aggregate or a set of

398
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android so we're just your</font>

399
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,580
infrastructure address space and get an

400
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,780
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what's going on instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

401
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> letting your router dump the</font>

402
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,360
traffic or the router become the become

403
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,770
the victim right so so one of the things

404
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,030
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of right is if</font>

405
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,100
you're going to announce more specifics

406
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,330
for your larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network aggregates one</font>

407
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,949
is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font>

408
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,770
those aggregates out of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

409
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:06,770
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> in put explicit policies in place to</font>

410
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,810
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and and make sure other</font>

411
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,700
things if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were to announce those</font>

412
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,500
prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> rider you decide to change your</font>

413
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,110
announcement policies things like mes

414
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,240
could be affected which I have an issue

415
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,280
with mu DS that's in a separate issue so

416
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I won't get into but uh m.ed s could be</font>

417
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,220
affected based on your announcement

418
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,110
policies that sort the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

419
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,940
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that come from central</font>

420
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:30,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">network aggregation and you know I'm</font>

421
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:33,620
great gathering stuff so anyway ok so

422
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,600
the default route on a customer CP

423
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,969
device planets it's the ultimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

424
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,590
the ultimate vacuum for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Union for</font>

425
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,660
garbage right so what you're seeing is a

426
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,679
evah default route and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

427
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,880
garbage and they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere</font>

428
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,380
else to send it they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to send it</font>

429
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,380
to you so if you analyze that

430
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,650
alright so I've actually talked about

431
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,420
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this and a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you</font>

432
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there's a lot of volume there in</font>

433
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,810
the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of traffic or</font>

434
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,360
you know what should otherwise consider

435
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,860
noise and so fan lies that and you know

436
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,300
the overhead of it how you handle that

437
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,040
traffic is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become more more</font>

438
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,409
significant especially the sinkholes and

439
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,090
you know and and these botnets grow and

440
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,100
the bandwidth and the capabilities and

441
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,429
characteristics groups so to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

442
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,620
a handle on that would be a good things

443
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright dark IP space advertising dark</font>

inside your<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks to make sense is</font>

455
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,840
everyone with me here no questions so

456
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,020
far

457
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,918
we have lost someone everyone follow me

458
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,918
or just reading you know

459
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,549
anyway let's just hurry up nessa so what

460
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,169
you see here is any casting<font color="#CCCCCC"> calls what</font>

461
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:00,320
you could do is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a lot of</font>

462
00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:01,639
volume a lot of data you see so you put

463
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,289
sinkholes in different places in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

464
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:05,090
network and announced that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

465
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,470
either the same addresses or different

466
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,779
address ranges out of those sinkholes

467
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,429
and you can handle the volume better you

468
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:12,230
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> then handle things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

469
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,480
otherwise be pummeling a router you know

470
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">with no visibility kind of transparently</font>

471
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,870
and you just see router CPU go of it and

472
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:19,908
not know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in</font>

473
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">your network so if you know if you get</font>

474
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:22,549
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where you want to monitor</font>

475
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:25,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">things on network wide basis and</font>

476
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:26,600
skeleton but multiple sinkholes in your

477
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,000
network for different prefixes or to any

478
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,370
cast the same prefixes this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

479
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,809
the options<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want what it takes and</font>

480
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is kind of actually how we've seen</font>

481
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,139
some of the service writers we<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked</font>

482
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,730
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barry and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I both grow their</font>

483
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:39,469
sinkholes they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unix box</font>

484
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,909
and they went to distribute it you know

485
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,649
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinkholes in different place in</font>

486
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:44,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">their network for different prefixes and</font>

487
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:46,580
then to any casting them so that there's

488
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:48,649
low distribution because you know the

489
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,269
characteristics of different attacks

490
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:52,789
typically you know target one or two

491
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:54,470
sources<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus and rhenium sources or if</font>

492
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,850
you know one or two prefixes should we

493
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,889
say so if you could spread that out of

494
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,779
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a it's a little more</font>

495
00:22:57,889 --> 00:23:01,490
robust and gives you a better handle on

496
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:04,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">its going son</font>

497
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:07,929
and that's it so any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions so far</font>

498
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,928
for Barry comes back up and

499
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:18,900
so any any cast<font color="#E5E5E5"> of I mean any casting is</font>

500
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,190
a technique that how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people always</font>

501
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,590
ask this question how many people are

502
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,790
actively<font color="#E5E5E5"> using any cast in their</font>

503
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:28,080
networks today this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

504
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,670
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was wondering because any</font>

505
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,189
case have been out for quite a while and

506
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i realized was there's</font>

507
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:37,230
a lot of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers out there</font>

508
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,939
that don't realize this technique is out

509
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,470
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how they could use</font>

510
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,940
those or services in the end what's

511
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,950
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a couple of big providers</font>

512
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,510
I asked her back on crews are you guys

513
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,650
Annie Cassidy nests and was like silence

514
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,600
it was something that was done like five

515
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,800
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's still there but they</font>

516
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,500
didn't know what it was go running or

517
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,550
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this works so any case</font>

518
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,850
is one of those techniques that really

519
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:01,409
works it came up with and we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with</font>

520
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,870
DNS services probably the most common

521
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:07,050
purpose of it we also use it for

522
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:10,320
advertising are distributed sinkholes

523
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:12,149
and and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> for black hole ground</font>

524
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,460
advertisement like for instance when you

525
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">take inside your core and you take your</font>

526
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,030
aggregate<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocks you take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire</font>

527
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,280
advocate space you might advertise it

528
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:22,290
out as the pretenses and you do it

529
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,700
inside your core you never do it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

530
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,409
one of your background for routers you

531
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,590
do it maybe on three or four that's

532
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:33,900
actually any casted those you know big

533
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:35,280
blocks of / 19 / 18<font color="#E5E5E5"> / 20s you're not to</font>

534
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,610
any cast MP because you put on many

535
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,920
robbers the<font color="#CCCCCC"> any castle that's</font>

536
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,719
and then some some guys use any cast for

up with sinkholes because there's one

whacked I didn't he was his overwhelmed

he didn't expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much traffic</font>

560
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:33,110
coming into it so so he called me shut

00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,370
it off and he called me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what can we</font>

562
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,590
do is well why don't we spread it all

00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,689
over your network we just put sink holes

564

all over the place and then you know

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,600
because that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's going on</font>

00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now because you dropping packets</font>

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,070
came from so in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns model because</font>

577
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,450
that's a good reference model and it's

578
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,770
kind of a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference model you we</font>

579
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,310
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS servers sitting out there in</font>

580
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:11,129
different parts you networking we any

581
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:13,520
any casting an idea in basic anycast

582
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,800
week we basically got<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's the</font>

583
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,470
Microsoft DNS client you have to to dns

588
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,850
when somebody tries to resolve one of

589
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,010
the addresses you know that's in your

590
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,929
little you know my case a Microsoft

591
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,340
client you know and it tries to resolve

592
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:38,220
on other DNS addresses it goes to the

593
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,199
closest one to you right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

594
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,520
this the border gateway protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

595
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,690
border gateway protocol technique for

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,310
doing it there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an interior gateway</font>

597
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,230
protocol techniques we're doing any cast

598
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,850
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right on some people even to</font>

599
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:51,420
protect with DNS servers to take one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

600
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,860
the two DNS addresses put it in I<font color="#CCCCCC"> GP so</font>

601
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,650
it's only reachable inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

602
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the other one on their order a</font>

603
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,850
gateway protocol it gets advertised out

604
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,159
for the world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> protector the most cash</font>

605
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,199
flow easily so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of known we</font>

606
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,760
know how to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you can do</font>

607
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,030
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thing with sinkholes in</font>

608
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,860
this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know here's a guy little</font>

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">DNS forward in his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> daughter you know it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to be changed it basically take</font>

611
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,320
the customer he's sending out you know

612
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:20,040
he's infected he's got slam or something

613
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,600
affected and when you take in try to go

614
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,000
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and send him to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sinkhole he'll</font>

615
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,800
go to the closest sinkhole instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of to</font>

616
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,050
one central sinkhole go to the closest

617
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,580
one and then as you stretch out across

618
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,799
your network that allows you you know

619
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,899
for the edge that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also it</font>

620
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,250
distributes distributes<font color="#CCCCCC"> no effect so</font>

621
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:39,760
this the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the antique a sinkhole</font>

622
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:42,269
a configuration example for this is kike

623
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,460
figuration example taken from a typical

624
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:47,529
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS sort of configuration where</font>

625
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,600
I have servers and insight on my inside

626
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:51,580
of my work and these can be you know

627
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,678
sniffers or other things inside that I

628
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,480
want to send traffic over to I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

629
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">addresses on I got one address i use for</font>

630
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,890
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go to that configure and</font>

631
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,390
log on and do things with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

632
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,210
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> address is the address i'll use</font>

633
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:06,100
for for my sinkhole that all advertised

634
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,039
everywhere the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> address every where</font>

635
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,870
and when I a ver inside my network I

636
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,760
just my little sink called using

637
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,018
derogatory protocol and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside</font>

638
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,360
I've got 40 gateway protocol

639
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:18,340
advertisement network in this example so

640
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,229
so when I go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> on trigger and say</font>

641
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:24,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok say like the top once a server</font>

642
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:26,320
instance a when server instance a is my

643
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,019
sniffer and i want to send stuff over to

644
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,040
my sniffer that I send out and use that

645
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:37,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">one /w to this case it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 that 00</font>

646
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:41,840
/ them to use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 27</font>

647
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:43,730
so so with the sinkhole sinkhole you

648
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,918
know designed to pull an attack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

649
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">cast placement allows me to go through</font>

650
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,610
and place multiple sinkholes across my

651
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,429
network without going through and do a

652
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,139
major we<font color="#E5E5E5"> architect on my network and we</font>

653
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:56,360
kind of know we got several providers

654
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,370
who have done this now that's how they

655
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,080
deployed their sinkholes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

656
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,120
one and they've moved down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a knee</font>

657
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,830
cast model because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy for</font>

658
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,780
them to find an extra port somewhere in

659
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,970
a pop or next report<font color="#CCCCCC"> and appear in</font>

660
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">connection and stick a little switch off</font>

661
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,570
of it and some some extra low you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

662
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">extra routers off the side of it in</font>

663
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,750
there in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lac space to build a</font>

664
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,309
sinkhole in that particular Colo

665
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,440
location may spread them all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

666
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:19,908
place and then control it<font color="#E5E5E5"> centrally from</font>

667
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,870
their security desk when they do the

668
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:22,870
security mitigation

669
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,730
so and you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

670
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,860
spreading across<font color="#CCCCCC"> about regional data</font>

671
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,720
center sort of a Pocho you can push them

672
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,070
all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge or no there's all</font>

673
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,640
sorts of flexibility that you can do

674
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:40,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">with any castle of civility otherwise if</font>

675
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have one central one then your talk</font>

676
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,820
about you know upgrading circuits

677
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,070
control and bandwidth going into<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

678
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing calling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having you know the</font>

679
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,700
concern of happens too much of the

680
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,260
attack traffic going into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinkhole</font>

681
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,820
and saturate that<font color="#CCCCCC"> likes going into the</font>

682
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,820
single there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of traffic</font>

683
00:29:55,149 --> 00:30:02,258
so so I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Souter this in the</font>

684
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:03,639
early stages because you know I got you

685
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:06,369
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a few providers who are doing</font>

686
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:07,869
this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we as more people looking at</font>

687
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:09,369
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will probably see more traction</font>

688
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:11,488
hopefully more people kind of look at

689
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:14,439
this as a lot of security tool deployed

690
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:16,690
the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have these deployed during</font>

691
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,129
slammer we're in a good advantage

692
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,379
because they were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

693
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:23,889
sinkholes to say okay I got six

694
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:26,199
different sinkholes and hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

695
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:29,589
west side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my backbone in the United</font>

696
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,059
States<font color="#CCCCCC"> has more Slammers than my east</font>

697
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:32,799
side of the United States they are

698
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:35,320
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to look at the different</font>

699
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,149
sinkholes and say in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case using the</font>

700
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,339
tractor turbo worms able to say like oh

701
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:40,748
wow did we able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get regionalized</font>

702
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,940
attitude to find out okay where should

703
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:44,379
we put most of our helpdesk support to

704
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,190
help our customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plug up the</font>

705
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:50,230
slammer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're able</font>

706
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:53,650
the sickles going on out there so that's

707
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:55,179
that's another plus for another this is

708
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,740
another one of those tech techniques

709
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:57,760
these tricks that somebody came up to me

710
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,090
and said like hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's</font>

711
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,990
another technique we found is in

712
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,000
protecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> we point-to-point links</font>

713
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,980
inside your backbone so here in this

714
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,720
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a point-to-point link on a</font>

715
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,299
backbone and you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

716
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,220
what sort of traffic goes cross on a

717
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:13,720
point-to-point link right this is like

718
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,580
you know inside your backbone so when

719
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,429
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it you break it down you</font>

720
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:20,620
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> more degree protocol ntp things</font>

721
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:23,350
like that inside your network you're

722
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,350
using loop backs<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and so you</font>

723
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:29,139
loopback addresses right are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not your</font>

724
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,539
point the point lines that separate your

725
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,030
ones who use a point-to-point links are

726
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:36,129
things like you carry gay tree protocols

727
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:39,970
you know things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like your your link</font>

728
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:41,530
protocols right now those when they when

729
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:44,110
they look at the look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they all he</font>

730
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:45,850
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the connected route because</font>

731
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,110
it's directly connected so don't

732
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,189
actually need a routing protocol will

733
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,678
come up and run it because they're

734
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,480
sitting adjacent to each other right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

735
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:53,890
when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like you know being</font>

736
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,220
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send traffic to these</font>

737
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:59,080
point-to-point links right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

738
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,270
really need outside world<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

739
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,799
get to these point-to-point links<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

740
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:05,049
do they really need that somebody really

741
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,730
need to ping your<font color="#E5E5E5"> backbone link somebody</font>

742
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:08,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">really need to ping you know some</font>

743
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:11,770
customer outside planet lead to pay me

00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,020
or c180<font color="#CCCCCC"> OC 48 points you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not not</font>

745
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">really you know when you think about but</font>

746
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,799
people can trace route because they can

747
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:19,690
trace about these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aster</font>

748
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:21,668
addresses to show up because they trace

749
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,320
route these addresses show up people

750
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:25,270
could say ah here's intelligence for me

751
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,530
to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> target I want to go after on</font>

752
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,299
his attack a router<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a trace a</font>

753
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,799
couple of tracer on Stewart provider I

754
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:31,179
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough addresses on the</font>

755
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:34,600
point-to-point links i can go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

756
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:36,159
and rock black the routers so to protect

757
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,389
them in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> people use different</font>

758
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,840
things to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect these these</font>

759
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:41,420
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> point-to-point</font>

760
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:44,510
people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a CLS in the past some people</font>

761
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:47,480
tried using RFC 1918<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

762
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">a public example but you have problems</font>

763
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,230
with reflection attacks with it which

764
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,590
I'll talk about what a reflection attack

765
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:56,240
is so so one idea that one of the one of

766
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the guys came out with says hey you know</font>

767
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,320
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this what happened was a</font>

768
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:03,379
scenario where one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the customers was</font>

769
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,080
attacked so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> went they jumped in to</font>

770
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,540
help their customer out and then the cut

771
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker shift at the attack off of</font>

772
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,980
the customer and attack the routers that

773
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,740
supported<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer so the attack</font>

774
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:18,440
targets shifted from the customer to the

775
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,420
service providers routers to hit the

776
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,070
service providers routers you know and

777
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,050
so here they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what are we</font>

778
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,580
going to do now these<font color="#CCCCCC"> backbone links to</font>

779
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:27,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect it and what they did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is they</font>

780
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,780
threw on a sinkhole he basically took

781
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,070
clear all the infrastructure blocks all

782
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,110
the point-to-point link addresses

783
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">society network and they advertised off</font>

784
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:38,389
the sinkhole and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that did is the</font>

785
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:40,879
attack that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after a a one of</font>

786
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:44,140
their routers point-to-point links all

787
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,140
went down into the sinkhole

788
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so it shud shoved it down down</font>

789
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,580
to sinkholes it was a way for them

790
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,730
protector the point-to-point links that

791
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:56,929
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so so in this case give give</font>

792
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:58,820
an example here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's not at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

793
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,310
important here is not a perfect sort of

794
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,710
solution because there are links that

795
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:06,139
for instance when I go and say like in

796
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:09,320
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> case the top attack flow I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

797
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,570
after 198 0 to 2 which is that first

798
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,190
link that first router in so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

799
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,830
router in there this technique wouldn't

800
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,510
protect that one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> router a which</font>

801
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">is my border router the parent router</font>

802
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,640
has a connected prefex going to that

803
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:25,820
right but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second one the one on</font>

804
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,069
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom which is 198 0225 that's</font>

805
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,890
inside that's that's more than two hops

806
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:32,330
into my network inside my backbone

807
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:34,850
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try to send beyond their</font>

808
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,310
would go down to the same so like a lot

809
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">of security solutions it's it's not a</font>

810
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect solution but it is a tool it's a</font>

811
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,009
technique that you can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so it's</font>

812
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,839
one of those things that if you plan for

813
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,790
you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and just set up a</font>

814
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,670
little rule and have you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all your</font>

815
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,380
infrastructure addresses you know handy

816
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,720
that you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inject them</font>

817
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,420
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so with this one provider</font>

818
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,669
does is they have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> their st. call ready</font>

819
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,230
to turn on they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a turn out</font>

820
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,240
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time but I ever ready to turn on</font>

821
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,090
and you know exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> all their addresses</font>

822
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,370
and so this situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens again they</font>

823
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,140
can easily go on a box activate the

824
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,730
little rule they have prepared and be

825
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,450
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this technique to protect us</font>

826
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:16,210
up some of the infrastructure addresses

827
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:18,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so so this is kind of like you</font>

828
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,950
know traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting sucked down into</font>

829
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:23,250
the sinkhole instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being sent off</font>

830
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:27,970
into one of the point-to-point addresses

831
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:31,510
now another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some</font>

832
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,640
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> say well RFC 1918 addresses i use</font>

833
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:35,410
RFC 1918 addresses but you know that

834
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,779
some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say yeah but</font>

835
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:40,779
I RFC 1918 addresses has point-to-point

836
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,060
infrastructure addresses which<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC's you</font>

837
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,070
know says you<font color="#CCCCCC"> shouldn't use public</font>

838
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,450
internet space but people<font color="#CCCCCC"> say all give</font>

839
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,670
me more security because people can't

840
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:50,169
attack me then but then nobody ever

841
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,570
mentions to them while you can do a

842
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:55,140
reflection attack and reflection attack

843
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:58,480
is where I send in addresses which are

844
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:02,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically RFC 1918 addresses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's pooped</font>

845
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:05,050
in my source addresses and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hit</font>

846
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:07,810
customers who have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my network</font>

847
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:10,210
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is my customers</font>

848
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:12,790
then reply to my infrastructure

849
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,349
addresses which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> parsing 1980</font>

850
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,970
addresses so you get all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

851
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:17,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">scatter junk and just reply this</font>

852
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,540
reflection that's a couple reflection

853
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:22,060
that's targeted at a particular

854
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">interface so in this case my reflection</font>

855
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,430
target is is on router be and I used

856
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as a reflection target and so again</font>

857
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:32,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">here this is one of those things where</font>

858
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,819
if you have a black hole the

859
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,410
infrastructure block partly

860
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:37,029
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses is a technique</font>

861
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,348
that you can use the mitigating win if

862
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,930
this sort of thing happens with these

863
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:42,790
sort of reflection sort of attacks and

864
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,950
this is especially coming true as people

865
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,020
starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> also look at you know</font>

866
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,220
putting ACLs on the edge when you put a

867
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,710
CLS on the edge protecting

868
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:54,970
infrastructure blocks you got got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not</font>

869
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:57,339
only do stop the destination address we

870
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:59,770
also got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the anti spoof the source</font>

871
00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:02,259
address so you got to have an ACL that's

872
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:05,290
constructed just like an enterprise ACL

873
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:07,630
where you don't allow any source address

874
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">two equals my own block my</font>

875
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,229
infrastructure blocks

876
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:12,670
and no destination address going into my

877
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,499
infrastructure blocks plus it's

878
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,930
explicitly permitted like an ebgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier</font>

879
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:18,519
in connection so you got to do both some

880
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,779
some some providers i was talking to

881
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:21,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing one they're just doing</font>

882
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">a destination is it but you got to do</font>

883
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:25,900
both otherwise you're going to booking

884
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:28,420
these sort of reflection attacks out

885
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:32,140
there now while all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

886
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:34,509
to and pour it for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tutorial</font>

887
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:37,029
we're probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get over the</font>

888
00:37:34,509 --> 00:37:38,650
Scimitar quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> lusty the people have a</font>

889
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:40,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of questions on it is is preparing</font>

890
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the next turbo one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually we do</font>

891
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,709
these in the fall and all but we were

892
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:47,140
asked to maybe kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do this this time</font>

893
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:49,209
as kind of like preparing for the next

894
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,729
rubble one now we all know we got hit

895
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:53,288
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy was slammer and as we</font>

00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:55,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last nanog when we did</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a post-mortem on it you know thank you</font>

898
00:37:55,059 --> 00:38:00,029
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> goodness we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started working on</font>

899
00:37:57,009 --> 00:38:03,009
ways to talking to each other ISP to ISP

900
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:05,469
because as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Pisa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Salih singh vs</font>

901
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:06,999
because we had an SP sec and a couple

902
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:08,890
other tools out there to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each</font>

903
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:11,799
other we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly figure out</font>

904
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:14,650
how to contain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and do the containment</font>

905
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:17,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">filter zone so just to stop it otherwise</font>

906
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,670
this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a really</font>

907
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:21,609
real nightmare you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it was pretty</font>

908
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:23,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">bad that it is really once you contain a</font>

909
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:25,598
warrant right you know kind of like

910
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,489
there's three stages of war mitigation

911
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,469
stage one is identifying what's going on

912
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:31,449
stage two is containing it it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

913
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:32,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you know sorrows out an Asian you</font>

914
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:35,289
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> contain you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to isolate and</font>

915
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:36,910
you get a you know section and off in

916
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:38,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">this part of network and then the third</font>

917
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,390
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go out there</font>

918
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:42,910
and cure it you got to fix it well what

919
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,859
happened with slammer is luckily<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

920
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,749
people out there that can identify a

921
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:48,640
quick and we figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a containment</font>

922
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:50,558
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then what happened is it took</font>

923
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,989
quite a while to start clearing up the

924
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem and the ones who were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

925
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:56,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear out fast with people up there with</font>

926
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:59,739
sinkholes because one of the things that

927
00:38:56,829 --> 00:39:01,390
a sinkhole would do as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sinkhole will</font>

928
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:03,099
give you a statistic from the

929
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,808
backscatter off the worm of the scans

930
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:05,680
off the worm you get to sort of things

931
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,900
got from there you get

932
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,609
the the worm actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> hitting you</font>

933
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,410
because these worms go out there and

934
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:13,779
start scanning you know the entire

935
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:15,640
internet space and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have some</font>

936
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,500
bull<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone space and some dark IP space</font>

937
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,848
on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> sink hole guess what your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sink</font>

938
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,109
hole is going to pick that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that's</font>

939
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:21,579
because they hate you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got all</font>

940
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:22,750
these scans going on here you know

941
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:24,040
what's what's going on some of these

942
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">scanning me here let's identify this</font>

943
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,700
plus fire at my sniffer and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of take</font>

944
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:30,160
a packet capture and say oh this is a

945
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,419
worm and the other thing you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

946
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,430
get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is the backscatter from</font>

947
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,079
all the other failed attempts across

948
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,460
your network so you're going to towards

949
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:38,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">the source of data and they're going to</font>

950
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sinkhole with me and what you get</font>

951
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">all this audio sinkhole is who's</font>

952
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,319
infected because you know you got a

953
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer in effect in the computer not</font>

954
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:48,460
trying to hide the fact that hey

955
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:50,770
uninfected I'm trying to affect use the

956
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,720
code red and uh you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> slammer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all you</font>

957
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:54,819
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily use the sink holes that go</font>

958
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,189
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are my infected hosts</font>

959
00:39:54,819 --> 00:40:00,200
and this is the third stage of container

960
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:03,290
which is he actually got a clean it up

961
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,879
right and the providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had these in</font>

962
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,130
their networks were able to go through

963
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and we contained it and then they</font>

964
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,560
were out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there to go out there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

965
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,150
their customers fixed because they had

966
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,320
these sinkholes in place all the guys

967
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,660
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and build the</font>

968
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,800
sinkholes you know while slammer was

969
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,049
going on said he can start identifying

970
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:21,020
he's who's infected and cleaning my back

971
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:23,690
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> loose in this case this is</font>

972
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:28,430
actually emulating you know what's what

973
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:30,890
happens in Cisco Cisco we got sink holes

974
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,660
that are we know our providers all all

975
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:35,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">of our upstream providers that Cisco</font>

976
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,609
uses have sinkholes deployed so we know

977
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the providers can use it and then</font>

978
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:41,570
inside our DMZ area we got one and

979
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,310
that's the most active one that's the

980
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:46,400
one that we use all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time because</font>

981
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:48,980
it's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ air in between you know</font>

982
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,600
firewall letters right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside</font>

983
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,300
Cisco's corporate network we got

984
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:56,020
sinkholes deployed all over across the

985
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:59,690
entire global torrent I to network those

986
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:02,060
mainly sit around oh so teen idol and

987
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:04,430
every now and then especially will get

988
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,560
lab servers pop up with my code red and

989
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:08,660
infection so they get about two or three

990
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Code Red named infections a month that</font>

991
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,080
pop up and they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spot them</font>

992
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,910
right away the sinkholes is picking

993
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,890
right up into hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and they're able</font>

994
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:18,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go down and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they go over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the lab</font>

995
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,700
and disconnect the left you know and

996
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,590
then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> called the lab admin and say</font>

997
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay one of your machines is affected</font>

998
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:25,250
out at the analyst let's plug it up with

999
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,380
fix it let's get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a patch sort of thing</font>

00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,690
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're able to spot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these inside the</font>

1001
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,310
corporate network quite effectively so

1002
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,440
the sinkhole concept is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1003
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:35,990
something that you can do in a highest

1004
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,420
be back home scenario but inside

1005
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a service providers own service</font>

1006
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,380
infrastructure corporate infrastructure

1007
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,930
your customers and enterprise scenario

1008
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,780
it's a cool off more that's good for the

1009
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:50,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">morn mitigation so so in summary the</font>

1010
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:53,240
nature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the threat in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slammers case</font>

1011
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:55,009
you know the 30 minutes is thrown out it

1012
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,359
was more it was more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know 10 15</font>

1013
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,950
minutes when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some of the</font>

1014
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,930
studies about the spread of the

1015
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:02,169
infection vector when you have turbo

1016
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:05,839
ones that go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and spread that fast</font>

1017
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:08,810
you can't wait until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the warrant happens</font>

1018
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,480
to go and build these tools and since

1019
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:13,759
these tools are not rocket science right

1020
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:17,270
none of the things here is hard right

1021
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they're not expensive because you</font>

1022
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,980
know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got guys who just took</font>

1023
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:25,340
a spare workstation loaded up zebra and

1024
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:27,890
and TCP dump on it and they had their

1025
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:31,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">sink hole right so they're not expensive</font>

1026
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:33,200
to do and with any cast deployment you

1027
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,840
don't have to we are rebuild your

1028
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,759
network to deploy on<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so it's</font>

1029
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,770
not like something you could say well

1030
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,619
all these differences why you don't the

1031
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:44,359
point but you can't wait until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

1032
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:46,580
turbo warm happens to the point is

1033
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:48,590
something that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to do now to</font>

1034
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,850
prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the next over one now we</font>

1035
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,980
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next turbo one's going to</font>

1036
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,330
happen we don't know when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

1037
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,710
what the attack vector is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

1038
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,060
and the infection vector is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1039
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:58,580
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next to the one who know it's</font>

1040
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,890
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen we also know because you</font>

1041
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,259
know where was y'all is not my head on

1042
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:06,910
the table when we had last night ugh and

1043
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:10,400
we had people up here on stage saying

1044
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:13,520
here is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the errors they made in the</font>

1045
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,140
slammer confront you know scan rate you

1046
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,850
know and say like you know slammer was

1047
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,230
fast but you know they made all these

1048
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:20,690
computational errors and they could have

1049
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,940
been faster you know and here's a map of

1050
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:26,270
how they could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been faster you know</font>

1051
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,710
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see you see you know people do</font>

1052
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,359
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analysis which is very</font>

1053
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,460
useful analysis but then somebody who's

1054
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,609
probably planning these next

1055
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,410
look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know get it from 10</font>

1056
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:38,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">minute global spread to like a</font>

1057
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:40,450
five-minute global spread so so the key

1058
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:44,890
thing here is be prepared that's what

1059
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:46,990
this talk is called up for that so and

1060

on here we'd like to you know thank some
