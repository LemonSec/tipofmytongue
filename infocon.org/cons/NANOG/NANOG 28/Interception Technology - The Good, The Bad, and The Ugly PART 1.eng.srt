1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,210
yeah I run mi cheese network I actually

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,950
got a phone call about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this morning</font>

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,230
mi T's network like many academic

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,790
networks belongs to the labs departments

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:17,550
and centers when it works they say

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,939
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how dare you tell us how to</font>

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,230
run our network but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course when it's</font>

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:28,289
broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's my network and that goes</font>

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,029
very deep my call this morning was from

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,170
a department that in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> it said we</font>

11
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,000
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about your centralized</font>

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,920
infrastructure for web serving we don't

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,540
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about anything you do will run</font>

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,670
everything ourselves thank you have a

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,739
nice day which my response is no problem

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the call was we have a</font>

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,500
student who basically flunked out and he

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:54,690
destroyed<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything can you restore us</font>

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:57,690
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup oh yeah well we're here</font>

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,480
today to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about not backing up data</font>

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,329
but but having people other than the

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,739
intended recipients listen to it and

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,380
let's see where's the page down on this

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">link</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now you want to talk about</font>

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">intersection you got to sort of define</font>

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,240
what it is and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's actually</font>

27
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">very interesting because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,070
look at various you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know statutes</font>

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,430
exactly defining what information is is

30
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,149
sometimes a trick but what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,860

parties but may go between any number of

35
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,439
parties and you want to intercept this

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,060
traffic you want to listen to this

37
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,889
traffic you want to view this traffic

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,320
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to do it in a way that the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">parties have no way of knowing that</font>

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're in fact doing that so it should</font>

43
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,979
doing this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard in very</font>

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,340
subtle ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spent some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time recently</font>

45
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,980
explaining to the FBI that if they get a

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,230
mailbox

47
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,690
that contains information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">intercepted that they need to look at it</font>

49
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,190
with a text<font color="#CCCCCC"> editor or printed but</font>

50
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,890
loading it into an email client would be

51
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:14,750
a mistake because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if any of that mail</font>

52
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:15,950
was HTML with source image tags when you

53
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,240
look at it you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do a hit</font>

54
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,369
against the web server and so it got to

55
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">be careful now of course the traditional</font>

56
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,420
cases of telephone wire tap and of

57
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,650
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the modern case I've seen was at</font>

58
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,540
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Massachusetts where they have</font>

59
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,040
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know said wall communications voice</font>

60
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,320
video emailing and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to</font>

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,049
cover the gamut if it sent

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,019
electronically or even carrier pigeon

63
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,130
they want to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what it is</font>

64
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,020
now there's several places you can do

65
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,660
interception I'm trying I want leaves

66
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,100
time for discussion so I'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover</font>

67
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,070
this pretty quickly there's as you know

68
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,190
the bit level layer to IP and the

69
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:54,290
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself bit level literally</font>

70
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,420
means there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a tool few years ago</font>

71
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,310
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> OC 3mon that actually could sort</font>

connection steal some of light now

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,730
that's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good example of a tapping</font>

75
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,350
technology that you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font>

76
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,519
it's there at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least not you know once</font>

77
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,650
you're at any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an electrical</font>

78
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,120
level and certainly not when you're at

79
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,530
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of logical level looking at</font>

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,690
data package of no way of knowing that

81
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody siphoning off your traffic but</font>

82
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,190
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with doing this is</font>

83
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,930
as bits move faster and faster you get a

84
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:26,480
deluge of stuff in fact what a lot of

85
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kaliya the communications assistance</font>

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,920
to law enforcement laws passed a few

87
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,680
years ago we're all about had to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

88
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,359
when the telephone network went digital

89
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,120
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening into an analog</font>

90
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,100
voicestream what would be on a pair<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

91
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,080
wires was a digital conglomeration of

92
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,420
goop and they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> no way of sorting</font>

93
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,180
through it and so this and of course the

94
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,708
faster this goes the harder this gets

95
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,080
now it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out you can do this at</font>

96
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,480
layer 2

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,580
layer 2 is I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you're all familiar</font>

98
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,040
with that with switches that have port

99
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,480
replication so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically command</font>

100
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,709
the switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all traffic going the</font>

101
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,420
port 1 also send a copy to port 3 and if

102
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,740
you put a passive monitoring device on

103
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,440
port 3 you're going to see all the

104
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,940
traffic destined for port 1 now if you

105
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,620
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get two way traffic little more</font>

106
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,440
subtle than that but it's certainly

107
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,120
easily doable and at least at this level

108
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,829
you're not trying to decode the bits now

109
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,690
at least you're presented with packets

110
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,599
and if the thing that you're replicating

111
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,219
is a small number of computers so port

112
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,740
to for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a switch goes to a</font>

113
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,480
single computer then by port replicating

114
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,210
that port you will in fact it everything

115
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,260
coming and going from that computer so

116
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,750
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you can</font>

117
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly do that now you can do things</font>

118
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,230
higher than that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can subvert routing</font>

119
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,240
you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something right at layer 3</font>

120
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,630
i've actually not played with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

121
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,370
played with the others but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if</font>

122
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,960
a router can implement a transparent web

123
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,790
cache a router can do this and so this

124
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">is another way of actually implementing</font>

125
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,520
this you still have the problem that if

126
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,160
you're looking at layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 you're looking</font>

127
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,510
at a lot of random data the other

128
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,040
problem you have is your a<font color="#CCCCCC"> law</font>

129
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">enforcement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organization is you know you</font>

130
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really care about IP addresses you</font>

131
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,130
know if they're looking to get my email

132
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,440
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily interested in</font>

traffic to or from any particular IP

135
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:18,190
that's destined to me on whatever IP

138
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,830
Schiller and I'm in nanog today and I

139
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,950
open up my laptop and I get a dhcp

140
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:30,539
address they need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that so that</font>

141
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,539
they can capture my traffic

142
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,670
now got ahead of myself oops one of the

143
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,120
subtleties with doing any of this sort

144
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,890
of port replication or layer 3 and

145
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,990
interception is the computers you use to

146
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,360
do this have to be faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the</font>

147
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,100
computers actually communicating because

148
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,440
by definition you're going to get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

149
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,570
more data so just because you have a

150
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,340
laptop or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a computer with 100 megabit</font>

151
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,240
Ethernet card doesn't mean that you're

152
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,520
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to successfully</font>

153
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,760
intercept all the traffic on 100 megabit

154
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,650
land even if it was all delivered<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

155
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,000
so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have overkill so if you</font>

156
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,710
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grab all the traffic you need to</font>

157
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,290
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems that are bigger than the</font>

158
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,770
unintended systems now by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

159
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:14,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people here familiar with decent if</font>

160
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,840
one of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite features and d smith</font>

161
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,820
was the application called tcp nice

162
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,590
which would insert interesting acts into

163
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,909
a tcp data stream in an attempt to make

164
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,989
it go slower so that you would get at

165
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">all I look at that stuff of course that</font>

166
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,230
would not cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for law enforcement</font>

167
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,490
because that does have the property that

168
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,080
you're injecting traffic and therefore

169
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,270
you're doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's detectable</font>

170
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,349
and they need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> undetectable but I</font>

171
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:41,299
looked at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice and that's that's</font>

172
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:43,190
clean I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that trick now one of the</font>

173
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,930
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spins on all of this is when</font>

174
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,930
you do various types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interception is</font>

175
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,130
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> cooperation do you require from a</font>

176
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,280
vendor or for an Internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> service</font>

177
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,630
provider to do your dirty deed now for

178
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">example if you were going to literally</font>

179
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,620
do something like an OC dream on tapping

180
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,539
a fiber cable you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what in theory</font>

181
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,100
could do that in a manhole in front of

182
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,020
the ISP and the ISP would never even

183
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,640
know you're doing it and for certain

184
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,560
government agencies that's exactly what

185
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,890
they want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

186
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,390
anybody to know what they're doing now

187
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,539
frankly tapping fiber can be a real pain

188
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:17,050
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say microwave link</font>

189
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:20,020
can you say 802 11 a link out of this

190
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:27,480
building but I doubt<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's any targets</font>

191
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:29,919
here but yeah tell the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't</font>

192
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,510
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most interesting form of</font>

193
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,000
interceptions application-layer

194
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,120
interception and that is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually bugger the application layer to</font>

196
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,060
do application data layer replication

197
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,500
now obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> this requires significant</font>

198
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,730
cooperation from whatever is offering

199
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:51,340
the service but it's the most likely to

200
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:54,120
actually grab everything it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

201
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,159
efficient in terms of computer resources

202
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,960
and in many cases is preferable now how

203
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,990
would you do that everybody familiar

204
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,320
with send mails milter facility this is

205
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,670
the sendmail interception facility

206
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,650
because you can certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a milter</font>

207
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,390
that has the property that it looks at

208
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,669
the headers of an incoming or outgoing

209
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,830
email message or any email message<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

210
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,320
through send mail and if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs a</font>

211
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,810
certain criteria put a copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

212
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">little file over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hex you don't even</font>

213
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,550
need to use the headers the milter has

214
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,020
access the entire data contents and if

215
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,270
you have enough horsepower on your cpu

216
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,159
to do spam detection and virus filtering

217
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,679
you have enough horsepower to do keyword

218
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,779
selection across email messages and put

219
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,998
copies into another file

220
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,429
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this type of</font>

221
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:42,729
interception exists today it's right

222
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:45,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the sendmail distribution just</font>

223
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,990
a little software needed on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side but</font>

224
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can tell you from experience it's not</font>

225
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,910
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of software similarly if you are</font>

226
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">building web services it's easy enough</font>

227
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,249
to arrange<font color="#E5E5E5"> to divert any traffic or any</font>

228
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,529
transactions that might be of interest

229
00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:00,850
for law enforcement for example and I'm

230
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:02,680
button by the way I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this to</font>

231
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,139
be true<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if I'm amazon.com for</font>

232
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,209
example it would be trivial for<font color="#E5E5E5"> law</font>

233
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:09,040
enforcement so to say to me every time

234
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:10,660
Jeff<font color="#E5E5E5"> chiller buys a book why don't you</font>

235
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,910
tell us what book you just bought and

236
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,439
that's certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> something they could do</font>

237
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,059
whether they do that or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I have no</font>

238
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:18,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea and the way of knowing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm</font>

239
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:20,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">not trying to you know disparage them in</font>

240
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,490
any way but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what i mean by</font>

241
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:28,000
application interception

242
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,860
now what's the goals of<font color="#CCCCCC"> intersection</font>

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,900
this is where things get a little bit

244
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,370
interesting because what we're really

245
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,439
looking at is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a diversity of goals law</font>

246
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">enforcement their goal is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very</font>

247
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,570
simple reliable interception with

248
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,890
maximum operational security well that's

249
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,390
a term you hear a lot when you deal with

250
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,360
law enforcement guys operational

251
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,189
security folks remember the old

252
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,560
carnivore boxes and the whole carnivore

253
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,420
debate of a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago that was the I</font>

254
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,329
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they renamed it something like BCS</font>

255
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">1000 or some you know well I can think</font>

256
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was in the FCT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carnivore of course</font>

257
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,480
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FBI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet interception box</font>

258
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,350
and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first heard about it I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

259
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,370
what idiot came up with that name

260
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,530
because there was never a name that

261
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,040
would sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trigger controversy that</font>

262
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,040
was it
