1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
Oh what is a citizen one well as citizen

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,449
after all wants accountability of law

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,770
enforcement now it's funny we all sit

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,990
there we say what we want accountability

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:14,129
but you know that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we want</font>

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,599
what we want is don't spy on me don't

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,160
spy on me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what you</font>

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,690

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,670
me one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons that I've seen</font>

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,080
among people when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them about</font>

lawful intercept them do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel</font>

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,330
nervous about this is very common

14
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,290
attitude is of course they should listen

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,219
in on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad guys corollary I'm not a</font>

17
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,730
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't understand how quickly one</font>

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,550
can go from good guy too bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> status</font>

20
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,809
completely innocent so finally what

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,399
everybody wants if security everybody

22
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,780
doesn't even want does not want an

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,600
interception system that has the

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:02,160
property that the average high school

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,969
student can also use it and that's

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually going to be an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

27
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,110
thing here now we talked a little bit

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,789
about security as a security ad for a

29
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,200
number of years I<font color="#CCCCCC"> lived</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this pain and</font>

30
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,640
you know

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,770
when are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to have a secure</font>

32
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,659
internet when human nature changes

33
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,829
that's when human nature is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ain't</font>

34
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:23,899
going to happen to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why would</font>

35
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:25,759
anybody ever bother<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so whenever we're</font>

36
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:27,140
inventing technology we always say to

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,090
ourselves we'll add the security later

38
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,259
because after<font color="#CCCCCC"> all nobody's breaking into</font>

39
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,600
it today<font color="#E5E5E5"> but of course guess what the</font>

43
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,259
deployed and if you've deployed it

44
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,770
widely fixing it later is very very hard

45
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:48,049
thus the mess we have today thus the

46
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,179
nanog wireless network that once again

49
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,700
11 they said let's come up with a scheme

50
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,409
where there's a key negotiation with the

51

would do encryption diffie-hellman key

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,739
sort of wimpy non deployable thing

called wireless equivalent privacy which

believe anybody I should use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

61

we get crap no now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your cell phone and you know</font>

there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> backdoor into most cell phones</font>

77
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,459
and the way you learn what the code is

78
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:06,349
is you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to google and you type in the</font>

79
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,319
manufacturer name the model number of

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:12,108
your phone access code

81
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,700
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will likely find it so for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">example on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nokia this is not a Nokia</font>

83

pound one two three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five pound is</font>

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,530
one of those magic codes you enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

86
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,180
and among the things you can change and

87
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,879
renounce the security code that you

88
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,500
thought was securing your phone and so

89
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:29,719
there's no such thing as a closed design

90
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,280
that stays that way for very long<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

91
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore you want to design things in</font>

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,769
the open now<font color="#CCCCCC"> another issue about</font>

93
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,219
securities there's always a security

94
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,930
versus convenience trade-off you know

95
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:43,959
for many years I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince</font>

96
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,519
myself that this trade-off didn't exist

97
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,769
that if you were designing a system and

98
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,319
it had this trade-off as part of it then

99
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:54,139
you were getting something wrong but

100
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:56,030
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time has told me that there really</font>

101
00:03:54,139 --> 00:04:00,420
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security convenience trade-off that</font>

102
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:03,440
guess what people want convenience

103
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:07,470
law enforcement agencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> consist of</font>

104
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,900
people people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want convenience remember</font>

105
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,680
that critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of securities</font>

106
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,910
accountability and finally now one of

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,680
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say about security in</font>

108
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:21,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">general is in order to be deployable</font>

109
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,800
security must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost-effective easy to</font>

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,970
use and incrementally deployable now for

111
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,490
this talk incremental deployable

112
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,050
necessarily doesn't play but it has to

113
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,550
be easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because if it's not easy</font>

114
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,050
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> among other things it'll get</font>

115
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,180
misconfigured and if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss</font>

116
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,870
configuration results in no security

117
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,490
your host now security is different from

118
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,380
most other technologies we deal with in

119
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,479
that if you screw up the config file of

120
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,400
for most systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> at our technological</font>

we were doing at the IETF during one and

134
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,190
security meeting see we were sniffing

135
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,260
the traffic on the wireless and then we

136
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,520
published all the passwords after which

137
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,250
we didn't publish the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user names or host</font>

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,690
just the passwords so that everybody who

would see their password would know who

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,270
employer well guess what somebody had

146
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,849
misconfigured the config file at the

147
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,780
employer so that none of those tunnels

148
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,850
were encrypted anymore no one knew

149
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,559
because everything still worked you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

150
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,060
the data flow the applications ran

151
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,770
except instead of being encrypted it was

152
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,990
in the clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would know if they</font>

153
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,310
didn't look we looked we saw but later

154
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,830
figured out it had been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state for</font>

155
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,080
several months

156
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,190
so every<font color="#CCCCCC"> employee in every password of</font>

157
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,780
every employee was potentially

158
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,090
compromised and they didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

159
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,070
they were using security technology it

160
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,380
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there was negligent and it</font>

161
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:10,670
was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple config file error and</font>

162
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">there you have it now I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this before</font>

163
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,480
law enforcement wants operational

164
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">security which means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very few people</font>

165
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,160
know about the intercept and those who

166
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,780
do are being threatened like you know

167
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,610
you tell anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this and we're</font>

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:27,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to put you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a cell for a really</font>

really long time they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be cheap</font>

170
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,770
they want to be able to do more

171
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,590
intercepts in fact they wanted to be

172
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,000
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> I remember a certain law</font>

173
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,070
enforcement guide to complaining to me a

174
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,630
number of years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said you</font>

175
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,560
know cell networks so this was back in

176
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,020
the days when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were talking about</font>

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kalia most cell networks deployed in</font>

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,520
this country were actually installed

179
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,919
with wiretapping built-in in an

180
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy-to-use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fashion and so I said I'm</font>

181
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,970
surprised you're complaining about the

New York City<font color="#CCCCCC"> cell phone network excuse</font>

183
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,880
me wasn't that deployed with all this

184
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,850
wiretapping ability says yes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

185
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,000
weren't enough trunks we can only listen

186
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:05,480
in to like 30 conversations at once and

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,860
that's not enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

188
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,590
how many conversations they wanted to

189
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,590
listen in to and they said all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

190
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,130
well they wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> that capability after</font>

191
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,380
all you what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that line from the</font>

192
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,819
president's analyst James Colburn<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

193
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,020
in the basement and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he says I'm paranoid</font>

194
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:25,030
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think everybody around me</font>

195
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,198
spies and then there's a great shootout

196
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,090
scene where they all kill each other and

197
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,090
he's still alive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x what's</font>

198
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,219
wonderful I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really paranoid but</font>

199
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,138
really we're all spies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so like</font>

200
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,979
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe everybody in New York</font>

201
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,210
City's a bad guy right so they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

202
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,430
be available<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course they wanted</font>

203
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,508
to be remotely implementable they want

204
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,130
to be able to sit from the comfort and

205
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:47,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">convenience of their little cubicle and</font>

206
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,229
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever headquarters and be</font>

207
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,789
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say oh yes let's type in the</font>

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,710

209
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:56,020
Schiller oh yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay he's got these IP</font>

210
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,320
addresses i'll click the intercept

211
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,630
button and bingo you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all shows</font>

212
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,520
up someplace and then you know maybe

213
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,169
there's a button later since refine your

214
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,229
your intercept and they can put in

215
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:11,560
keywords or something doing it remotely

216
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:12,789
obviously is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy it has better</font>

217
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,800
operational security implications

218
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:16,659
because presumably what an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP does is</font>

219
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,860
they plug the big wire into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back of</font>

220
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:19,509
the big router and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they don't worry</font>

221
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it anymore so you have good</font>

222
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:24,070
operational security you hopefully have

223
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,229
no technical limits on availability and

224
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,400
you know nobody's really looking over

225
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:28,750
your shoulder which is great in case you

226
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,370
screw up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch the wrong guy you can</font>

227
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,510
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wipe those records out used</font>

228
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,750
to know

229
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,939
now of course as citizens what we want

230
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,260
our checks and balances we want

231
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,050
accountability security and all that

232
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,360
other good stuff and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problems</font>

233
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:46,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">with interception is loss of</font>

234
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,060
confidentiality is really very hard to

235
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,890
prove if I'm listening in on your

236
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,900
communications and I learned something

237
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting about you as a result and</font>

238
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:00,620
then I exploit that information how do

239
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,870
you know where you lost it so a lot of

240
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,640
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we talked about you know you</font>

241
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,200
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> information needed to be kept</font>

242
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,660
confidential by various parties that you

243
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,810
do business<font color="#E5E5E5"> with nevermind intercept you</font>

244
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,569
know it's such a bit so bogus because

245
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,819
how would a common person know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

246
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,820
their credit card company you know let

247
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:23,660
their details slip in the heat of

248
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,610
suhrkamp remember the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir can worm a an</font>

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,319
independent local exchange carrier when

250
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,180
he's little ilex which<font color="#CCCCCC"> add you know some</font>

253
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,120
an Excel spreadsheet with 10,000 clients

254
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:40,180
records in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that we're using Excel</font>

255
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,980

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,989
card number expiration date mother's

257
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,610
maiden name and even that little three

258
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,260
digit extra security code that's on the

259
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:53,460
card 10,000 of them delivered to my

260
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,260
mailbox now if i exploited one of those

261
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,210
how would they ever know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

262
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> liked that did it so losing</font>

263
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,860
confidentiality is very hard to trace

264
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,150
now of course what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the service</font>

265
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,900
provider one in the world

266
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:11,520
service providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are businesses</font>

267
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,220
whenever I hear a business tell me our

268
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,170
mission is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop the best damn</font>

269
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,110
blobbity blobbity block I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

270
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:22,050
bull the mission of every business is to

271
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:26,820
make money anything after that is a

272
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">strategy to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money so among other</font>

273
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,850
things you want the protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

274
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,880
liability and<font color="#CCCCCC"> rands absolutely right you</font>

275
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,210
do not want an outage by the way the law

276
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,490
enforcement guys don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> an outage to</font>

277
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:41,520
please when there is an outage it risks

278
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,950
operational security and it causes

279
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">people like ran to make you remember it</font>

280
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,450
forever<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it has all sorts of bad</font>

281
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,100
implications<font color="#CCCCCC"> so at least on that</font>

282
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular score both the ISPs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and law</font>

283
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,940
enforcement guys are in the same boat

284
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and maybe your reputation is important</font>

285
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,070
to you I was actually thinking people

286
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,290
cared about their reputation when I

287
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,500
wrote this slide but I have my doubts at

288
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,500
times

289
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,670
so what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of where I've mentioned</font>

290
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:08,030
it several times I called Internet

291
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:12,410
interception version<font color="#CCCCCC"> one now I don't</font>

292
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:15,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">know with a capital K how carnivore</font>

293
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,780
worked but I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some pretty</font>

294
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,329
educated guesses from the what little

295
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:23,120
information they disclosed publicly

296
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,320
which is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> decent if on steroids or</font>

297
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,300
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point maybe it's actually</font>

298
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,980
stupider than<font color="#E5E5E5"> D sniff but it hasn't</font>

299
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,620
hooked sin and obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> for looking at</font>

300
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,540
PPP and radius to figure out what IP

301
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,000
address we should be intercepting do

302
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,290
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to map an account name so they</font>

303
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,670
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the radius transaction</font>

304
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,040
say oh here's Jeff chiller coming online

305
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,329
you just got this IP address assigned to

306
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,160
him so now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grab all the</font>

307
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,450
traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and after</font>

308
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,089
they've narrowed it down to an IP

309
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:50,420
address it's just a big sniffer you know

310
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:52,310
recording it in some format it was not a

311
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,780
cheap solution like I said they went out

312
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,520
there and would like design it for each

313
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,990
intercept to look like all the other

314
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,140
boxes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rack and all that other</font>

315
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,430
good stuff but it required minimal

316
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,260
cooperation was the kind of thing that

317
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,050
you know yeah once you've got the duplex

318
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:10,370
right on the port you plugged it into

319
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:12,199
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could actually require</font>

320
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,630
not much more cooperation from the ISP

321
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,540
importantly the ISP does not necessarily

322
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:22,499
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know who it is that you're</font>

323
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,659
listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so it has no accountability</font>

324
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:26,189
now let me tell you the whole carnivore

325
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:30,269
thing left a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad taste in my</font>

326
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:33,079
mouth because<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything they did ranch</font>

327
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,579
is counter to what and up<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know an</font>

328
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,769
upstanding organization should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

329
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:40,049
of all there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> this issue of should</font>

330
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:41,399
there be a design review a public design

331
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:43,228
review well they didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one</font>

332
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,609
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> after all these guys have come</font>

333
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,079
from a culture of secrecy so they just

334
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:47,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">it just rubbed them the wrong way they</font>

335
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,589
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

336
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,929
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed to have a third party</font>

337
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:53,399
look at it but then it turns out the

338
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:54,899
third party they selected had all sorts

339
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,059
of ties to the government which they

340
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,829
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hide from us because when they</font>

341
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,209
published the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual document they</font>

342
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:02,669
got from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third party proposing to</font>

343
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:05,518
look at this they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> done redacting to</font>

344
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:07,439
remove information about some aspects of

345
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">that proposal except they were idiots</font>

346
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:13,169
and they used<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adobe to do that and I</font>

347
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,489
looked at it I was actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

348
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:16,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">this document and it painted on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

349
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:21,089
screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the redacted words there</font>

350
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:24,149
and then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> black them out and I said</font>

351
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:26,369
gee that means the<font color="#E5E5E5"> informations still</font>

352
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:29,759
there so a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a little Emacs</font>

353
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:31,619
and we had the non redacted portions and

354
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,359
the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really was disturbing was</font>

355
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:35,519
what they redacted was the ties between

356
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:38,039
those supposedly independent reviewers

357
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,200
and the government that's what they

358
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,210
redacted

359
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,680
and so I'm saying you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

360
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:50,160
slime now slime does not match with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

361
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,449
word accountability and in fact when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

362
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,829
talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> him about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how does</font>

363
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,660
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's going on here</font>

364
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">butters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the accountability said well you</font>

365
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only do what the judge says</font>

366
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,459
after all<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when we all know I</font>

367
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:07,380
actually had FBI agent tell me that the

368
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:09,600
FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> never ever broke a law and I said</font>

369
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,680
really what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> j edgar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hoover and his</font>

370
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,330
dossiers and all that stuff oh when I

371
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,880
love this was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 80 this is a</font>

372
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:20,010
definitional issue remember i said

373
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,320
earlier when it works it's their network

374
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,430
and when it's broken it's my network

375
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,230
well when they're doing their job

376
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:30,150
they're the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when somebody's</font>

377
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:31,890
being bad they're a rogue agent this is

378
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,180
a mission<font color="#CCCCCC"> impossible as Secretary will</font>

379
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,030
shall disavow any knowledge of your

380
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,260
action well this is that this guy was

381
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,240
deadly serious and he was not joking

382
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,689
with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> says we never do anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

383
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:46,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so so this doesn't leave me with</font>

384
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,150
warm fuzzies<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that accountability is</font>

385
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:52,340
really there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing is even</font>

386
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,340
competent which is important

387
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:56,730
so

388
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,680
now let me say by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way if they</font>

389
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:03,050
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do third party review of the</font>

390
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,250
carnivore box how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

391
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,310
thirteen-year-old Timmy with more time

392
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,490
on his hands can't figure out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

393
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,619
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the carnivore box in and read out</font>

394
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:17,370
everything that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it and the answer</font>

395
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:20,329
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we don't so there's a</font>

396
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,329
balancing act here

397
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:26,080
should we use an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> process to design</font>

398
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:28,420
these things i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think yes should we be</font>

399
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,710
accountable now that promise where do

400
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,790
you get the accountability on intercept

401
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:35,620
who should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the accountable party now</font>

402
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP in the sense that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i run the</font>

403
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,520
network at MIT and actually legally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

404
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,459
an ISP and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISM those you know the</font>

405
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,270
legal obligations of ISPs I get to have

406
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,950
those so for example when somebody

407
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,660
reports to us that an<font color="#E5E5E5"> mi a member of my</font>

408
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,390
community is exchanging child

409
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:56,050
pornography over my network I have a

410
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:58,240
legal obligation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to report them to the</font>

411
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,599
federal government<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's a law</font>

412
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,690
that says an ISP must do that by the way

413
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,250
if as an ISP you fail to do that the

414
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,600
person who originally complained to you

415
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,600
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly to the government and</font>

416
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,050
get a fifty-thousand-dollar bounty

417
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,070
because you were bad and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

418
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,750
there's also a law that says I can't

419
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">reveal any information about my students</font>

420
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,490
to the federal<font color="#CCCCCC"> government so I had these</font>

421
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:24,250
two lost one says you dare not and the

422
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,480
other says you must laws don't have to

423
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,510
be consistent this is what lawyers are

424
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,710
for and afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anyone the bar</font>

425
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,770
wants to know how it resolved that one

426
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:34,870
it's an interesting story but so I'm an

427
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,640
ISP but I also represent my students and

428
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,780
my staff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the members of my community</font>

429
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,030
so I as an individual would much rather

430
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,550
have if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be an intercept</font>

431
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:47,680
order against a member<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my community</font>

432
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:50,740
that I get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that order and I get</font>

433
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,660
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be in the data path and make</font>

434
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,010
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they get only what they're</font>

435
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,100
supposed to get

436
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,630
so I'm providing a certain level of

437
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">accountability to them because I'm</font>

438
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:04,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">making sure that are only getting what</font>

439
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:07,470
they're asking for but that's work now

440
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,470
it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

441
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:14,189
go on here here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem i agonize</font>

442
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,569
by the way over this talk all right up

443
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:19,030
until now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did the easy part here's</font>

444
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:22,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the hard part starts you know</font>

445
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:24,770
should we be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> intercepts</font>

446
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:28,210
now you know if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to speak on</font>

447
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:32,450
this subject on September chance of 2001

448
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:34,600
as many of you I would be saying no<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

449
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,800
know we don't we don't need this okay

450
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I was sort of like everybody</font>

451
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">else the civil libertarian type and and</font>

452
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,280
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we were worried about the</font>

453
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,070
government and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the world</font>

454
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,820
changed the next day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there really</font>

455
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:53,120
are bad guys and they really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

456
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,730
us harm and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we reconcile that</font>

457
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,070
between making sure at the same time we

458
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:02,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't give the government such power</font>

459
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:04,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know privacy becomes a quaint</font>

460
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,030
ancient concept

461
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,930
and this is the problem

462
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,580
now

463
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,620
I don't want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about politics</font>

464
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,800
today because that's an odd conversation

465
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,709
to go on at the bar forever but i'm

466
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,830
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about technology</font>

467
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:23,420
can you do secure intercept and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

468
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,520
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by that is can you design an</font>

469
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,690
interception system that doesn't have a

470
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,860
side effect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> timmy can listen in to</font>

471
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,150
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this problem i said</font>

472
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,250
well you know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to limit it</font>

473
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,510
to the FBI if you wanted to say we want

474
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to create a system and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font>

475
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,810
ignore the<font color="#E5E5E5"> international aspect of this</font>

476
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,420
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the united states for a</font>

477
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,820
minute if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say we want to</font>

478
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,400
create a system so that the FBI is the

479
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:51,200
sole law enforcement agency that has the

480
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,640
power to do an internet intercept maybe

481
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,680
we could design something that was

482
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,050
secure and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's protocol</font>

483
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,460
geeks among you certainly plenty that I

484
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,500
know who<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

485
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,120
certificate-based and public keys and we

486
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,250
exchanged this and we do that and we

487
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,379
record<font color="#E5E5E5"> a log record here we and we get</font>

488
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:09,590
all our keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed just so we get it</font>

489
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,270
so right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that only the FBI in an</font>

490
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,370
appropriately authorized agent of the

491
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:15,410
FBI with a smart card and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dallas</font>

492
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,159
little I button and all this other great

493
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:21,320
technology can actually do the intercept

494
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,870
but the reality is that's not what's

495
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,760
being asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's being asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

496
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,320
is lawful intercept and one has to

497
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,090
recognize it in the United States alone

498
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,320
there are nineteen thousand law

499
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:34,990
enforcement organizations

500
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,029
and they run the gamut of capabilities

501
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,250
from some<font color="#E5E5E5"> very sophisticated folks</font>

502
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:42,759
though to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've yet to find</font>

503
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:46,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">them to some really unsophisticated</font>

504
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:47,259
folks and so you're going to have law

505
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,340
enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what think I</font>

506
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:51,220
don't want they're going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

507
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,629
website that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they go to and type in who</font>

508
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,210
they're interested in like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said before</font>

509
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,080
the google<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's go listen in and</font>

510
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,179
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be</font>

511
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,199
secure because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security is going to</font>

512
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:01,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">get in the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

513
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,279
inconvenient and so they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

514
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:08,200
drive the technology in a direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

515
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,789
predict that's going to lead to a system

516
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to be trivially compromise</font>

517
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">about by you know just about any</font>

518
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:18,340
teenager with some internet savvy and

519
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,870
like many things the security holes

520
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,629
won't be found until it's widely

521
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,949
deployed that's my prediction that's my

522
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:25,840
fear

523
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,100
and of course we do have to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

524
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,539
what about foreign governments here in

525
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,189
the United States we like to think that

526
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:31,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">our governments accountable but there's</font>

527
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,700
plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world in</font>

528
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:36,518
fact I've been told about countries that

529
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,490
actually have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirement for multiple</font>

530
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:41,700
simultaneous intercepts of not only

531
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,409
customer data but each other's data and

532
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,630
it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be compartmentalized because</font>

533
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,000
you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> law enforcement agency a</font>

534
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,399
to know that law enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> agency</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> B is</font>

535
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,510
also doing an intercept which might even

536
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:57,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">be of law</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enforcement agency</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> A's traffic</font>

537
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,840
so how's that for an odd requirement

538
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,519
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even trust each other</font>

539
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,449
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll think about that's kind of</font>

540
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:04,049
cool because they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at each other</font>

541
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,049
but we'll leave that aside

542
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,970
then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question of will it be</font>

543
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,790
effective if we design all this

544
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,900
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> to intercept on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

545
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:16,260
are we going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get anything other than</font>

546
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:20,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid bad guys I mean after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

547
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,780
became widely known<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I mean we're</font>

548
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,760
here that<font color="#CCCCCC"> al-qaeda is using the internet</font>

549
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,840
to communicate but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

550
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,120
interesting things about how they're

551
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,159
doing that for one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

552
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,719
know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody else did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

553
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">have really great internet you know</font>

554
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,220
interception technology and so they take

555
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,840
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that but guess what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

556
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">not stupid when they figure out that</font>

557
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,320
it's being intercepted right and left

558
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,639
they'll change their tactics but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

559
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the common things that they're doing is</font>

560
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,380
they're using steganography which is the

561
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,709
art of communicating secret information

562
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,120
in plain sight and that can range from

563
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,400
the very technical aspects of

564
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,639
steganography which might involve hiding

565
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,840
a message inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> a JPEG image to really</font>

566
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,030
low-tech approaches of steganography

567
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,620
which is when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit on the radio</font>

568
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,389
the audio tape that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got from</font>

569
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,219
the number to guide<font color="#E5E5E5"> al-qaeda who uses</font>

570
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,900
some very flowery language to describe

571
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,320
all the horrible things he's going to do

572
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,810
to us and you figure obviously there's

573
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,000
there's hidden code words in there that

574
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,919
have a meaning that's steganography and

575
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,450
so the question is does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really</font>

576
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,130
prevent them from taking advantage of

577
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right here's an</font>

578
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,020
example you guys sends the audio tape

579
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's maybe you know five minutes long</font>

580
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,860
everybody knows just by keywords in

581
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,149
there and nobody knows what they mean

582
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,860
what the heck good does intercept do you

583
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,480
if he can't figure out what on earth<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

584
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:38,939
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

585
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:40,260
and so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fears is and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is by</font>

586
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way a criticism that's been made of</font>

587
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,620
the US government for a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

588
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,780
particularly the intelligence community

589
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,239
that by using electronic methods

590
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,590
electronic methods are really clean you

591
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,020
know you kind of do them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your nice</font>

592
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:54,178
office go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee pot get a</font>

593
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,129
cup of coffee you don't have to be on

594
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,500
the ground Intelligence you don't have

595
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,540
to recruit agents and so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fears</font>

596
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,390
is if you overly depend on let's doing

597
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,649
internet intercepts maybe what happens

598
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,059
is you stop doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hard work of</font>

599
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,160
actually infiltrating the real bad guys

600
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,178
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now this is not my field so I'm not</font>

601
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one to judge</font>

602
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just that I wonder if we could</font>

603
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">deploy a very hairy technology to</font>

604
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,490
intercept everything and then it turns

605
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,280
out you know all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get our teenagers</font>

606
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:23,429
and dope dealers and not the real bad

607
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,020
guys we'd really like to get and so I'm

608
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:26,640
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end this talk by saying I</font>

609
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,530
always wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this on a slide and</font>

610
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,080
don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pronounce the Latin is</font>

611
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,610
stands for who watches the Watchers

612
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,678
which is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> another way of saying</font>

613
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,879
how do we get accountability in this and

614
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,880
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the end of my slow</font>
