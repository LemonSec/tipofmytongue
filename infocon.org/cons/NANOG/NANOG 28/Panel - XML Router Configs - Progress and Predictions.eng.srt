00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,690
generate the configurations and you blow

have people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hired in from</font>

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,790
and change the configurations

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:53,120
continually and then you wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> why your</font>

57
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,859
network doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is very common</font>

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,950
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially common in the large</font>

59
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,510
telcos where the price of an engineer is

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:04,100
considered more<font color="#E5E5E5"> important than a running</font>

61
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:08,390
network and they have a saying the

00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">network is the database of record ie</font>

63
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,070
these configurations are the real

<font color="#CCCCCC">Network the stuff we have in our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that and this causes long-term problems</font>

67
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:29,140
um so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up with why</font>

68
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you configure your network and</font>

69
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,690
woody did a draft operator requirements

70
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,080
document and it had some good<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

71
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,430
about the command language interface

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,530
using text secure transport etc but it

73
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,830
was kind of a small operator<font color="#E5E5E5"> view not</font>

74
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,990
the large operator view and and the joke

75
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,680
that we started circulating around ITF

76
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:57,560
it's the CLI stupid but why was it the

77
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,890
CLI why is the CLI what's important and

78
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,470
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly because text the CL eyes</font>

79
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,839
text and text is universal<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

80
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:09,230
malleable with lots of tools I can send

81
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,739
it by email to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my friends I can run grip</font>

82
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:16,200
on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can generate it with disgusting</font>

83
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:21,090
languages like pearl or m4

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:24,090
okay it's also the CLI wins because the

85
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:27,630
vendors take five years to get the mid

86
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,520
done for a new feature but for them to

87
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,050
test their new feature internally

88
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,620
themselves they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hack it into the</font>

89
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:38,670
CLI so when it ships in beta I've got it

90
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,680
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CLI I don't have it in the mid so</font>

91
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:46,230
the IAB the internet architecture board

92
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:49,590
of the ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> held a workshop about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

93
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,510
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago with some network management</font>

94
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,750
people some operators and protocol

95
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:59,880
people etc etc to try and sort out what

96
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:04,800
the threads were here the result was an

97
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,600
exit was a xml-based effort known<font color="#E5E5E5"> as XML</font>

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,540
comp there was a design team within the

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,530
ITF this is the first draft to come out

100
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:17,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's an working group in</font>

101
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:21,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the idea and that's currently the state</font>

102
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> play today I personally just want to</font>

103
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,560
push a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level vision I'm interested</font>

104
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">in configuring networks not just devices</font>

105
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,540
so this leads me to things like

106
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,670
transaction models right there's usually

107
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,830
two routers on the ends of a link not

108
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,380
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I need you to configure them</font>

109
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,180
both and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem cascades through my</font>

110
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,830
network when I want to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> my routing</font>

111
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,460
policy I want to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in my entire</font>

112
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:50,909
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay security identity</font>

113
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,710
authentication authorization where the

114
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,320
administrative and security boundaries

115
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:58,650
are in my network trust of peers and

116
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,969
registries these are the architectural

117
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,508
issues

118
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:06,729
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the</font>

119
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:11,709
language issues are what we focused on

120
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:14,229
so far and how to achieve these I think

121
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:16,389
next we've threatened to have John

122
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:20,399
easily up I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do some</font>

123
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,399
laptop manage magic to make this work

124
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,640
I have to apologize his I'm not really

125
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,440
much of one with PowerPoint or anything

126
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,599
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is the best you're</font>

127
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get black and white and and</font>

128
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,130
some web interface

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">volume closer better all right so I</font>

130
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:55,650
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my purpose is here too based on my</font>

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,790
experience having nada made it a bunch

companies to express what my opinion is

134

about and I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> I share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a with</font>

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,740
configuration interface or more

138
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:21,710
precisely a management interface that is

139
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:26,390
programmatically

140
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:28,219
run are defined so and you've all heard

141
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,340
this before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in one way or</font>

142
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,020
another especially if you visited any

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:41,600
visited any other working group meetings

as Randy mentioned before everybody did

146
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,050
everything directly on the router and in

147
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,440
the long run you pay for that pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font>

148
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:55,069
dearly when there's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

149
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:59,000
do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> but panic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have no</font>

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">is correct</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what is what is an error</font>

152
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:10,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been introduced and generally</font>

153
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,570
introduced without your knowledge so

154
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,690
as you hit these problems it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,019
be fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious that that this doesn't</font>

156
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,110
scale as Randy always says you're

157
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,670
spending more the majority of your time

158
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,970
fighting problems than you are

159
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:32,420
supporting your customers adding new

160
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:37,190
features and generally managing all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

161
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:40,339
other things you need to do so one way

162
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,639
to to break out of that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

163
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:46,509
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of folks have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done this is to</font>

164
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:50,630
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> generating your configs which is</font>

165
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:55,790
what vario does and I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a large</font>

00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,620
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have generation if you</font>

168
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,019
don't have this kind of management

169
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,860
you're going to lose there's no we have

170
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:11,569
sands or buts about it so we've done is

171
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:14,660
we have a database<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end we have a</font>

172
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:18,349
bunch of homegrown tools the tools that

173
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:21,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">are coming from or in the past have come</font>

174
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:26,760
from companies

175
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:29,610
working towards this market have really

176
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,110
missed the mark they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

177
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,360
flexibility they don't have what we want

178
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,760
at all and the number of companies doing

179
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,770
that is fairly small and probably

180
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,210
growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller I would gather at least</font>

181
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:46,730
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service providers point of view</font>

182
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise eats this stuff up and</font>

183
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,750
companies like juniper and cisco and so

184
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,700
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how they could they could</font>

185
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,250
really avoid getting involved in that to

186
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,970
some degree because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the enterprise likes</font>

187
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:04,370
the HP openview the SNMP manageable or

188
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,190
rather everything is a GUI management

189
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:10,190
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that just doesn't work for</font>

190
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,930
for the provider generally write your

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">NOC needs to have those kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools</font>

192
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:18,199
but you don't really want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

193
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:20,930
configuring your network so you have to

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,960
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> what with the actual managers of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network are doing or want rather and</font>

196
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:32,210
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is simple tools almost</font>

197
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,220
grassroots if you will nothing overly

198
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:37,250
complex and it really doesn't need to be

199
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:41,650
overly complex sort of beauty and

200
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,650
simplicity so

201
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:51,209
we take all these these database entries

202
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:53,969
that define our peers msdp general

203
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,680
things about a device and we build

204
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,280
complete configurations for those

205
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,270
devices and push them out onto onto the

206
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:07,709
device when we need to make changes and

207
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:11,069
never use right mem or what is the other

210
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:21,120
anyway right ma'am we<font color="#E5E5E5"> performed daily</font>

211
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,250
tasks that are all scripted we perform

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,320
our own monitoring consistency checking

213
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:29,610
between the devices on the database and

214
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,830
vice versa and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really the</font>

215
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,050
important part to take away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

216
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:37,560
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that not only is it automated</font>

217
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:40,020
but we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data in once and it comes</font>

218
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,540
out multiple times<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over again</font>

219
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:47,310
to serve for input to various tools and

220
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,280
you reduce the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of discrepancies</font>

221
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:53,219
that you introduced into and to your

222
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,410
network as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of work</font>

to make in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> job to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make the network</font>

225
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:08,380
run function properly

226
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:08,380
so we do see eventually

227
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:18,229
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want well we don't want some</font>

massive system

229
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,620
that we have to not only manage the

230
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:26,600
network we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage this</font>

231
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,260
monstrosity of a management system like

232
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,910
HP openview great thing for a knock

233
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,650
doesn't work for for doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

234
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,680
management especially not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think from</font>

235
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:38,180
the service provider point of view and

236
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,699
certainly not from various point of view

237
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,969
and I believe a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the</font>

238
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,070
industry share that opinion and we'd

239
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,890
like to avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different interface</font>

for every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor problem yeah and</font>

241
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:56,060
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one way we can do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

at bgp for example they all have peers

00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:14,300
they all have policy granted the policy

248
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,900
knobs the way you configure your policy

249
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,699
is different on each device but from

250
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,370
where you start those can all be done

251
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,920
the same in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same way the same kind</font>

of syntax which can be translated to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:33,890

lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors will say we want we want</font>

256
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,960
we want to differentiate ourselves from

or they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done generically all</font>

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,450
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can configure a BGP beer</font>

263
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:58,370
generically it has an IP address it has

264
00:14:53,450 --> 00:15:01,010
a policy it has a source address

265
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,870
whatever it may be there are a lot of

266
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are compatible on that same</font>

267
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,390
way you know every car has a steering

268
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,590
wheel might be on a different side but

269
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:13,330
they all have steering wheels and we can

270
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,330
all drive that car when we get into it

271
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,930
so

272
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,290
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want out of a network</font>

273
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,180
management system we want that

changed a field to have a colon on it

280
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,490
now well you didn't anticipate that and

281
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,959
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you are a regex god it's not</font>

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,820
time trying to to fix that problem and

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it was a complete waste you could</font>

286
00:15:52,680 --> 00:16:02,339
whatever but one thing to recognize I

287
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:07,589
think on that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CLI has access</font>

288
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:11,040
to everything it has more data than you

00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:14,580
can get from SNMP there's no interest in

290
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:19,260
replacing SNMP it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> value we don't</font>

291
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:21,630
want to necessarily use<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML or whatever</font>

292
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:25,200
that this programmatic interface might

293
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:27,689
be to replace collecting statistics from

294
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,580
interfaces

295
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,120
I think that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a little bit</font>

296
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:35,790
more expensive than then SNMP is at the

297
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,800
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we want to be able to access</font>

298
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">all this data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

299
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,530
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the configuration the all the</font>

300
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,620
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out of show interface</font>

301
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:48,180
for example and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is possible I think</font>

302
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">because all the data is already there</font>

303
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,969
it's just a translation mechanism within

304
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,819
the device so Cisco gives you a show

305
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,800
interface and it's in one format almost

306
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,160
all or perhaps all that data is

307
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,870
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the Juniper for example and</font>

308
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,389
vice versa it might be slightly

309
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,240
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> format but if i can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

310
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">in some kind of a programmatic interface</font>

311
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,209
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to screen scrape and I</font>

312
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,699
don't have to follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single</font>

313
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:18,689
version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operating system for that</font>

314
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:21,480
particular device and I don't want

315
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:25,589
vendors to choose my transport I don't

316
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,630
want to use ssl I want to use SSH I want

317
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use telnet I want to be able to</font>

318
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,060
configure it over the GG why I want my

319
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,970
wire monkey to go down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the pop push</font>

320
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,010
that box into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rack connect his</font>

321
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,930
laptop to it and run a script that

322
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:43,250
configures it enough so that i can

323
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,250
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

324
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:51,880
I think the important thing there is

325
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:54,040
that in the previous draft i think it

326
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,290
was Woody's draft he says well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

327
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:02,379
want to use ftp<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to be</font>

328
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:05,170
accessible and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want them</font>

329
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,850
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose my transport let me make my</font>

330
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:15,910
choice for what<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits with fits my needs</font>

331
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:17,500
right if I have sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if I if</font>

332
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,940
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use FTP and accept the</font>

333
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,200
consequences then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my prerogative</font>

334
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want the vendors to choose</font>

335
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,020
the language that I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use which is</font>

336
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:31,570
where a ski or just text based comes in

337
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:35,560
very useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can manipulate with</font>

338
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:38,470
whatever I want awk pearl see doesn't

339
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,330
matter it's up to me is this is just a

340
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,250
way to format the data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

341
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it or take out of the device</font>

342
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,980
and if at all possible I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to be</font>

343
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,840
human parsable I want to be able to read

344
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,310
it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly makes debugging a lot</font>

345
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,428
easier when I can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it directly</font>

346
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:57,580
rather than translating bits

347
00:18:54,429 --> 00:19:00,999
and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases one even wants to type it</font>

348
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:05,678
in manually so things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML that are</font>

349
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:07,570
purely purely text-based fit that

350
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:12,730
requirement very nicely it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> handy</font>

351
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:16,710
to be able to do that manually and let's

352
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:19,840
see and one of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about</font>

353
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:22,149
about SNMP I forgot to mention is that

354
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,908
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Randy suggested it takes forever to</font>

355
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:29,678
get that that mid through the ITF and

356
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:30,940
then implemented on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the on devices and I</font>

357
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,059
don't know how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it going to be</font>

358
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,940
before it breaks it's certain vendors

359
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:39,418
seem to break that repeatedly I can't

360
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,419
live with that

361
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:46,809
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML is or this interface is just to</font>

362
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,190
simply a translation I'm hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

363
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:50,220
that will be more reliable in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the long</font>

364
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,220
run

365
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,670
and the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to be able</font>

366
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:58,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do from from an interface like this</font>

367
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,680
as I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to connect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

368
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,810
device I want it to tell me what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

369
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:08,580
device it is what version it's running

370
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:12,090
and or be able to query that and I'd

371
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,770
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decide how i'm going</font>

372
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,379
to translate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that comes in or</font>

373
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,480
goes out to the device so if i connect

374
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Juniper I know it's a juniper and I</font>

375
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,910
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to use a certain translation</font>

376
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,220
it tells me but the mechanism that I get

377
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:29,430
that information to make my decision is

378
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,890
all generic I can connect to any device

379
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:36,900
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell me that so does</font>

380
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:40,200
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML provide that to us she</font>

381
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,920
certainly seems to it it has the

382
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">capability to give us all this data and</font>

383
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:50,010
it gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to us in the format</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

384
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:53,190
can we can parse and junipers made a

385
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:56,070
considerable effort at at implementing

386
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,280
this and they've done quite a critical

387
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,280
job

388
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,559
is it necessarily the best way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

389
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:10,539
I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't say others have suggested</font>

390
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:13,030
soap and I can't say if that's a better

391
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:16,870
mechanism having looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it only</font>

392
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:20,559
briefly the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> libraries that I had</font>

393
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:26,289
seen available for for soap weren't that

394
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:30,309
impressive so while<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML has a plethora</font>

395
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:32,020
of of libraries and and therefore all

396
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:34,870
laying all different languages there's

397
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,960
see this parole Python so on there's a

398
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,928
certain momentum here we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

399
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:45,700
this stuff already<font color="#E5E5E5"> done and one vendors</font>

400
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:51,510
already and implemented it and with with

401
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:54,870
mentem there's a perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> some acceptance</font>

402
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,870
so um

403
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:04,189
I hope that other vendors will will

404
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:06,880
embrace that and hmm how to how to

405
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,880
express this

406
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:12,410
we'll see a lot more tools that are

407
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:17,179
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to arise that already have the</font>

408
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:20,390
support and and maybe

409
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:24,170
not every ISP every user will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

410
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:27,380
invest the time I into developing their

411
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:29,590
own but with the momentum I think that

412
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,120
that a lot I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll take off I</font>

413
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,659
see there was some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other notes that I</font>

414
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,659
had here

415
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,760
oh yes

416
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,790
the one thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need to see</font>

417
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,960
about XML is how the other these other

418
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:50,420
vendors will accept number one what has

419
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">already been done and probably number</font>

420
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:56,210
two how they will if and how they will

421
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:59,780
accept generic interfaces and this

422
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:02,080
translation mechanism I think I'll leave

423
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">it at that</font>

to expose that those capabilities and

436

there's a powerful technologies for

doing data transformations on XML XML is

there's bits you don't care about you

569
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:02,470
group is to create a standard for for

00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,810
programmatic configuration and we really

571
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:07,240
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that it's something</font>

572
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:09,280
operators want to use and vendors are

573
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,890
going to are going to implement I've

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:19,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I'm very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of you know what can</font>

00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:21,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">go wrong and they a vergence of what</font>

577

operators want and what vendors were

578
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,290
working on and the IETF is working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so</font>

579
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,380
so we're kind of starting fresh here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

580
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:32,409
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can get operators really</font>

581
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,610
involved in the process so so that will

582
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:37,480
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll want</font>

583
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use and I don't know how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

584
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,630
here are involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ITF working groups</font>

585
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:48,100
I know it's it's no picnic it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

586
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:50,590
times it's a contentious a lot of effort

587
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,570
things take way too long to get done all

588
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,429
those reasons why it's easier to just

589
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,730
work on your network and forget about it

590
00:32:54,430 --> 00:33:00,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it really hope that that we can get</font>

591
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:05,310
some people here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to participate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

592
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,310
mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even attend meetings</font>

593
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:15,580
so here's the working group details if

594
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:18,158
my slides will be online later if you

595
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:22,230
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them from there there's</font>

596
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,230
already a mailing list in an archive and

597
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:29,678
so and one more plea to to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved</font>

598
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,330
read drafts even participating email you

599
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">can even send email to the chairs and</font>

600
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:36,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">say hey well your group is getting off</font>

601
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,549
track well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why they're</font>

602
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:41,710
talking about wisdom on and on we don't

603
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:44,320
care about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so so want to hear those</font>

604
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,820
kind of comments even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't want</font>

605
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,649
to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to the group you can send</font>

606
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:52,570
them to the chairs so so this psych on

607
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:54,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is taken right from the Charter about</font>

608
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:57,879
some of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the protocol is</font>

609
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:00,029
supposed to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you know</font>

610
00:33:57,879 --> 00:34:02,649
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to retrieve</font>

611
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:04,629
configurations be able to keep

612
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:07,479
configuration data and state data

613
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:10,359
separate from each other that seems to

614
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:14,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">be important a lot a lot of times diff</font>

615
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:15,969
tools show false positives because state

616
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,879
data is included in the configuration

617
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:20,678
want to avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs to be</font>

618
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,040
extensible enough so the vendors can

619
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,629
provide their own additional

620
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,719
configuration knobs and we can build on

621
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:30,308
standard configuration it needs to be a

622
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,319
programmatic interface to get away from

623
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:36,760
screen scraping everyone agrees on that

624
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:39,099
and use textual data that's seems to be

625
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:43,710
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong requirement that keeps</font>

626
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:47,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming back to us supporting existing</font>

627
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,460
authentication mechanisms this is still

628
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:51,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">not what's not clear how we're going to</font>

629
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:54,970
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this to support the same sort</font>

630
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:57,308
of authentication that that's used for

631
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:59,799
CLI but we need to do that somehow

632
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one of the goals of the working</font>

633
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:04,290
group

634
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:07,180
also to integrate with database tools I

635
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:09,520
think there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of XML tools that</font>

636
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,379
let you do this I don't know if we need

637
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,630
any special support<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the protocol or</font>

638
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,090
if just you know that will fall out for

639
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:21,700
free but hopefully that's that's that's

640
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:23,740
a goal as well we want to be able to

641
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,750
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> network wide transactions first</font>

642
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,660
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out exactly what this</font>

643
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:32,920
means if it means just configuration and

644
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:35,259
locking and roll back or if it needs to

645
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,110
be something more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's an</font>

646
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,970
explicit goal to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to to make it</font>

647
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:42,460
easy to configure something across

648
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:46,359
multiple boxes and have it all take it

649
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:50,050
once or all back out at once and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

650
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:52,030
want to provide for notification somehow

651
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,910
this this came out as a requirement

652
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:56,770
during the buff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people don't want</font>

653
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use a separate mechanism to receive</font>

654
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,420
like SNMP traps and then do their config

655
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:07,300
through this they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want one protocol to</font>

656
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:09,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to send notifications as well so</font>

657
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,410
so now go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the issues that</font>

658
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,810
are kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> already decided in the</font>

659
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,060
Charter see what you guys think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of if</font>

660
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:17,980
we've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> any mistakes here first of</font>

661
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">all it's a peer-to-peer protocol you</font>

662
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,870
know we're sending unicast messages

663
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,840
probably over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP definitely</font>

664
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:27,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">connection-oriented and which</font>

665
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,810
transactions are synchronous although

666
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,750
you have this ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get progress</font>

667
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:33,460
reports that phil was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about and</font>

668
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,790
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> end can initiate the connection</font>

669
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:40,300
so device can connect to a manager helps

670
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:43,420
get around firewall problems and that

671
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,390
sort of thing it's definitely session

672
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:48,310
based so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to setup</font>

673
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,620
configuration or per session

674
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,750
configuration parameters security and

675
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:55,029
use the capabilities exchange these sort

676
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,770
of things get done once at the beginning

677
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the session instead of on every</font>

678
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:01,440
transaction

679
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:04,230
and also the operational model is fairly

680
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,900
important that we be able to to define

681
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,520
features that can be extended in the

682
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,230
standards group over time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

683
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,460
vendors can add their own extensions and

684
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:16,860
you can identify these extensions by

685
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,110
capabilities exchange this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you don't</font>

686
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big a big offline</font>

687
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:24,120
database that says for this particular

688
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:26,340
version of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular box I can do</font>

689
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,839
this to it we want to be able to get

690
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">those capabilities in line in the</font>

691
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:35,520
protocol and instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintaining a</font>

692
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:38,970
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> datastore of all that so some</font>

693
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,310
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues already decided you know not</font>

694
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,720
set in stone but for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

695
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,220
assumption is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're decided is</font>

696
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,370
that we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be transported</font>

697
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">independent as possible but we're</font>

698
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:51,060
assuming certain things about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

699
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,190
transport like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's connection oriented</font>

700
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,680
and we want to be able to take advantage

701
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:58,410
of security features in the transport

702
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,000
layer and not reinvent all the security

703
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:04,230
mechanisms the application layer like

704
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,210
SNMP did there's going to be I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

705
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,130
some issue here or whether or not we're

706
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:11,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to we're going to standardize any</font>

707
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:14,010
transports that that aren't secure like

708
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:17,130
telnet I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're going to do</font>

709
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:19,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's you know certainly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

710
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,900
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to be added on if someone</font>

711
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,299
really wanted to do that we've already

712
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,130
decided to use XML for the data encoding

713
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> balance between</font>

714
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:32,550
machine and human readable and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

715
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:36,029
would but it's it's not we don't want to

716
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:38,700
exclude the possibility that that you

717
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:40,320
know router or CLI chunks can be moved

718
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,930
around with this protocol so there's

719
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:47,190
there's a notion that we should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

720
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:49,830
to use XML rapper to send CLI text it's

721
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:52,650
not likely that that vendors are going

722
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:56,549
to just cut over to a purely you know

723
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:59,100
XML driven configuration for for all

724
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,580
features that just not realistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

725
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:07,339
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to phase in the</font>

726
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:09,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">xml versions of the config so so a way</font>

727
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:12,260
to do that is to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to move you</font>

728
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:16,850
know CLI around in the protocol as well

729
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:19,040
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml versions of the config probably</font>

730
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:23,779
the most important design decision that

731
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:27,800
we made is to not work on the data model

732
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:29,900
right away so we will identify data

733
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:35,060
model issues that affect the protocol

734
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:39,470
things like a namespace management and

735
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:42,920
other things like what what you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

736
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:44,830
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> naming guidelines or XML usage</font>

737
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,350
guidelines that we want to put in place

738
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:51,620
but the working group is not going to

739
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:54,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">define standard data models for like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

740
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:56,180
and some things right<font color="#E5E5E5"> off right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off the</font>

741
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,390
bat hopefully this will happen in the

742
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:03,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF it'll happen in in you know various</font>

743
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:07,220
vendors doing their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML I understand</font>

744
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:10,490
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big red flag here is is that this</font>

745
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:13,870
protocol is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

746
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:18,049
from from day one from version 1 dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

747
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:21,710
so they'll still be proprietary content

748
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:23,570
around for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully we work out</font>

749
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">the protocol issues how to manipulate</font>

750
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:29,710
configs in a standard way and then it'll

751
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:33,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">be easier to figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

752
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:35,120
standardizing the data model one of the

753
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:38,060
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for keeping it separate is it</font>

754
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,370
takes forever to get stuff standardizing

755
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,890
the IETF and don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a minute</font>

756
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:45,440
that just because we move to XML instead

757
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:47,569
of SNMP that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go a lot</font>

758
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,700
faster to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all the vendors in the</font>

759
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:52,310
room to agree on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the knobs for a</font>

760
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,589
certain feature are that seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

761
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:57,200
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time hopefully we figure out how to</font>

762
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,760
speed that up but you know so there's

763
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,790
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a lag between</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">standards based management</font>

765
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:06,100
and proprietary configuration I don't

766
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:09,820
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that going away try to reduce the</font>

767

768
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:15,550
get to get the standards out when we

769
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:20,170
also decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're probably going</font>

770
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:23,500
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML schema to define things like</font>

the initial data types in the initial

00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:29,440

773
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:32,920
actual contents of the data models<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,480
still TBD<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

start working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that right away then</font>

776

hasn't officially started yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so some of</font>

the ideas for transport<font color="#E5E5E5"> mappings is to</font>

788
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:11,350
use beep to use SSL to use SSH Lisa

789
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,839
seemed to be the three leading

790
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:15,130
candidates we want to make the protocol

791
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,290
as transport an independent as possible

792
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:22,600
so that it can be mapped over different

793
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:24,610
transports as needed and we're in Italy

794
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML comp draft said we've used beep</font>

795
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,660
and we backed off of that if in the

796
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">worker group is formed and said we'll</font>

797
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:33,759
still need to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the RPC layer</font>

798
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:36,520
seems to also be controversial some

799
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,800
people want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use soap some people want</font>

800
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the RPC that's an XML comp draft</font>

801
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,670
some people just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to avoid the</font>

802
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:46,000
terminology RPC and called a simple

00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:47,980
request response we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what</font>

804
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,110
we're going to do there yet another

805
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:53,560
another big issue and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

806
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the biggest ones is the advanced</font>

807
00:42:53,560 --> 00:43:00,070
XML features<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this really depends on</font>

808
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:04,000
on the tool set so the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of starting</font>

809
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:05,470
point for for the operators of what kind

810
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,170
of tools are going to use to manipulate

811
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff I agree that it should be as</font>

812
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,140
tool neutral as possible you should be

813
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:15,779
able to use any language

814
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:19,150
and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I favor using plain</font>

815
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">XML as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as plain as possible and not</font>

816
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:26,440
relying on wisdom templates and fancy

817
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:30,630
features like XPath filtering within the

818
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:33,070
protocol but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

819
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:36,610
the protocol operations has been a

820
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:37,810
subject of discussion and haven't really

821
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:42,580
resolved what we're going to do there

822
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:44,680
the way to do add modify and delete I

823
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:47,110
won't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the details but there's</font>

824
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,629
various ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to place that into the XML</font>

825
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:52,300
and what ramification has on the

826
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:55,540
granularity of operations and such so

827
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,250
that needs to be resolved certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

828
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are advanced features that we</font>

829
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,730
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> have is optional some people</font>

830
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:02,200
think should be mandatory things like

831
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:05,110
the be able to do checkpoint and roll

832
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:07,089
back the ability to do locking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

833
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,800
kind of locking people some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

834
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,810
saying we should we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> do granular</font>

835
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,170
locking so you can like lock<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

836
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:17,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP config and or lock just interface</font>

837
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:19,410
ethernet<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 something like that currently</font>

838
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:22,419
the thinking is that we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

839
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:25,390
monolithic lock and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

840
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:28,420
either like that or don't so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems</font>

841
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:31,379
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fairly controversial multi-device</font>

842
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:34,510
operation support we think this is just

843
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">checkpoint and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roll back and locking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

844
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:38,950
we need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this further see</font>

845
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:41,920
what you know if there's anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

846
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:45,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need to do to support the ability to</font>

847
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,040
to push changes out on multiple routers

848
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:51,779
and have them all take or all back out

849
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:54,720
behind unreasonably at the same time and

850
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:57,240
the error handling<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess the the</font>

851
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,640
format of error messages how how

back on air so you automatically leave

the router in the state it was in when

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,820
explicitly so so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all</font>

866
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:40,290
i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was hoping there'd be some</font>

00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,650
feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the group on which way we</font>

868
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:46,850
should go on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these issues so</font>

869
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:46,850
anyone has any comments let me know

870
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,069
questions and everything you're welcome

871
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:15,140
at any time and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and</font>

throw throw find a mic microphone

873
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:34,450
it's kind of you know informal

874
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:39,130
participation so no one's formally

875
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:42,009
signed up to anything there are large

00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:48,480
this and some others as well we were

<font color="#CCCCCC">just in seeing this happened</font>

879
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:24,129
so I'm like a questions I'll give you

880
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:27,990
some of my poison of answers what we're

881
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,990
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in this effort is</font>

882
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:40,170
a serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> step without going beyond what</font>

883
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:42,240
we know as engineers how to do so it's

884
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:47,420
stuff that's near to what's already

885

can you explain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> further</font>

937
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,560
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple it's always there</font>

938
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:01,930
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like tftp right we don't</font>

939
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,650
want to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but sometimes it just</font>

940
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:04,649
works so well

941
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:13,580
right and some places I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can the reason</font>

942
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,710
we would not standardized<font color="#E5E5E5"> telnet as a</font>

943
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:20,529
transport is because we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it</font>

944
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:20,530
past the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighties yes</font>

945
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:27,069
but it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard</font>

946
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:31,780
what all you're doing is standardizing a

947
00:51:27,069 --> 00:51:34,000
data stream right I'll tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what the</font>

948
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:37,839
fantasy is the fantasy is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if he</font>

949
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:41,349
says he's using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this protocol must</font>

950
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:43,270
be used over encrypted transport that

951
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:47,470
this will get past the security people

952
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:50,980
of course this tool this tool said over

953
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:55,089
which this is being transported has in

954
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:57,450
the ITF protocols no way of saying down

955
00:51:55,089 --> 00:52:02,170
a layer by the way are you to secure

956
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:04,598
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> their top is irrelevant</font>

won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> less telnet for transporting</font>

959

00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:20,619
stupid I can say if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

964
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,150
provide a facility at least make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

right way if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to transport this</font>

967
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:29,470
over tell that I can't stop you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

974
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:45,339
just a quaint little thing is when we

first get these strange routers and

00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:14,950
having here but we do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

1007
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:16,419
from the mentality of that's the way we

1008
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:20,769
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how everybody does it is a</font>

say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said when i get that router</font>

00:54:22,989 --> 00:54:27,220
that's all that it has on it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

it

in this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> case all you're</font>

1015
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:38,169
giving me as data don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the choices</font>

1016
00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:41,500
for me I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> make my own choice make me</font>

1017
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:43,299
aware of what's available it's I mean

1018
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:47,230
that sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like drug policy in this</font>

1019
00:54:43,299 --> 00:54:49,180
country right stop making choices for me

1020
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:52,740
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the information I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">my own choices and and from there and</font>

1022
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,919
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you educate the people and</font>

1023
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,809
then they can make their own choice

1024
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:03,420
whatever works<font color="#E5E5E5"> best for them at that</font>

1025
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular point right</font>

1026
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:07,430
well there's a trade-off between

1027
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,460
flexibility and interoperability as a

1028
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:13,759
vendor we can't put you know seven

1029
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:17,540
different transports you know for this

1030
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,730
protocol on the box will put it will be

1031
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,980
much more inclined to get you know

1032
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:24,950
multi-vendor interoperability if we

1033
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:28,100
standardize a select few<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1034
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:29,899
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy you know this protocol</font>

1035
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,759
over telnet then I'm sort of a well if

1036
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,940
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy it over HTTP without</font>

1037
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,550
SSL<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm sure they will but doesn't</font>

1038
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:39,440
is the difference between vendors

1039
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:43,700
providing this in the ITF sanctioning it

1040
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:49,170
was as a standard maybe a subtle

1041
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:51,060
difference but it's fairly important one

1042
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:53,790
do it is

1043
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:56,430
you all right so now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> login and I have</font>

1044
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:59,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">sighs bin slash CLI right that's my</font>

1045
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:01,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">shelf as it were now I login</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I had</font>

1046
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,630
been slashed xml and that's my show

1047
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:10,470
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I login it's that's my decision</font>

1048
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:13,710
does that make sense right you well as

1049
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:16,980
if you're using a tool to get to get

1050
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:20,630
into the end of the box using this

1051
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:24,360
protocol the vendor has to implement it

1052
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:30,230
so so if there's no agreement on what to

1053
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:33,330
implement there then then you have to

1054
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:37,040
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all ad hoc there's</font>

1055
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:37,040
really no standardization involved

1056
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:44,200
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market will dictate</font>

1057
00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:48,650
if if the needs to be a lot more

1058
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:52,098
transports or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I fully</font>

1059
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:56,270
expect people to do this over HTTP with

1060
00:56:52,099 --> 00:57:01,210
without without SSL because they because

1061
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:05,000
they're already doing that but it but

1062
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:07,700
this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the same just say the IETF</font>

1063
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,200
standard way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this is just do</font>

1064
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:12,618
whatever security you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want we don't care</font>

1065
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:17,990
it was security<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care and they have</font>

1066
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:21,319
veto power over the document so did you

1067
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to go to this the examples I got at</font>

1068
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:26,779
it I don't know if they're even up to

1069
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:28,189
date just<font color="#CCCCCC"> one more comment please I may</font>

1070
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:31,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">be speaking from a narrow perspective</font>

1071
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:35,170
and that of the enterprise but from the

1072
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:39,859
perspective of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enterprise for my</font>

1073
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:43,609
enterprises liability perspective I it's

1074
00:57:39,859 --> 00:57:46,339
the who's me to not allow that<font color="#CCCCCC"> type of</font>

1075
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:48,890
transport across my network because it

1076
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:50,960
increases our risk of liability if that

1077
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:53,779
information is exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the public in</font>

1078
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,990
any way whether it's typically would be

1079
00:57:53,780 --> 00:58:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">from an internal capture of the data</font>

1080
00:57:56,990 --> 00:58:03,348
being put out on it on a news border

1081
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:06,260
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so my perspective may be</font>

1082
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:07,500
narrow but that's what the enterprise

1083
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:10,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">has to deal with is we</font>

1084
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,160
to limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> our liability</font>

1085
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:19,670
I think the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> position is usually in</font>

1086
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:22,279
this area to be to force vendors to

1087
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:26,390
supply a secure path but they don't

1088
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:29,230
force operators to use it it wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1089
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:32,230
impossible to do and wouldn't make sense

1090
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,230
so

1091
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:43,149
bill<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you want to go over these</font>

1092
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:46,890
examples are so here's some examples of

1093
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:50,130
protocol this one is I get configuration

1094
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,129
from the

1095
00:58:51,230 --> 00:59:00,400
the running configuration you're getting

1096
00:58:55,070 --> 00:59:03,250
a bad echo<font color="#E5E5E5"> had it you're getting a</font>

subset of the configuration given<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1098
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:08,000

1100
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:18,680

1101
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:23,420

arbitrary hierarchical path of

configuration in that in that

1104
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,109
configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

1105
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:37,200
the format can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be either XML or text</font>

1106
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:40,410
text will give you the whatever the

1107
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,750
native format of the boxes XML will give

1108
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:45,259
you the configuration expressed in our

1109
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,260
view of tags

1110
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:54,599
so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> applied for that from that</font>

1111
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:57,109
RPC would be something like this where

1112
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:57,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have the</font>

1113
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:06,050
we have the

reply configuration tag containing

01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:11,840

1117
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:17,620
this case it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> faint these two users</font>

1118
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:17,620
one in route 1 and Fred

1119
01:00:20,869 --> 01:00:27,079
to change the configuration you do an

edit edit configuration RPC targeting

1151
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:07,020
doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

1152
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,360
there's a delay

1153
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:16,900
I'll just talk a lot that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Oh</font>

1154
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:18,730
and so felt back a couple slides since

1155
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:21,870
randy said questions were<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay anytime</font>

1156
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:27,100
time I've been meaning to ask you this

1157
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:31,180
several<font color="#CCCCCC"> times um so when we put ours</font>

1158
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:33,520
together as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we had just not</font>

1159
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:35,770
edit we had replaced as well as at it

1160
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:39,820
and I just wondered why that didn't

1161
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:41,200
occur to you guys because we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1162
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:44,980
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps you just want to replace a</font>

1163
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:48,279
section instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> edit it right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1164
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:49,660
comes as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> visitor is the replace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rate</font>

1165
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:52,630
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> under and edit configuration</font>

1166
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:54,580
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you put it some of these</font>

1167
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:56,170
things as an option in there is a

1168
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:58,450
republished in the Edit instead of the

1169
01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:00,240
other way around I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wondered why you</font>

1170
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:02,470
did it that way instead of the opposite

1171
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:06,000
nothing other than office took<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

1172
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:06,000
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to get to the same thing</font>

1173
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,689
um

1174
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:30,550
so from this example one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I</font>

1175
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:32,680
wanted to point out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's completing</font>

1176
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:34,869
an open issue is is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that</font>

1177
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:38,589
interface name equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet 0 / 1</font>

1178
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:40,900
that's that's you know just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> author's</font>

1179
01:03:38,589 --> 01:03:43,060
choice and who did the slide with think

1180
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:46,540
was me but there's a lot of different

1181
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:49,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways that you can do naming inside the</font>

1182
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">XML and I think part of the standard has</font>

1183
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:57,430
to be you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we going to do</font>

1184
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:59,980
for for standard data models for you

1185
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:03,399
know how to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of naming does</font>

1186
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:06,760
it impacts the authorization model for

1187
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:09,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and so it's kind of</font>

1188
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,690
relevant to this protocol

1189
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,410
more questions

1190
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,649
let's break<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 minutes early whoops</font>

1191
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:27,270
