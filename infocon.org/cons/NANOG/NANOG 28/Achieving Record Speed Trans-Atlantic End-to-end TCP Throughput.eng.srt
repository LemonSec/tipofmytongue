thanks a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot so where this came out of</font>

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,240
was broken into speed internet land

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,989
speed record and this erupted kind of a

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,940
furor on the nanog mailing list with

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,080
remarks like what am I missing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,269
else said I'm going to launch at that

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,160
thought it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interested maybe go</font>

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,920

was done how<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it done what's special</font>

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,830
about this who needs it anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,840
what comes next and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,610
where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find out more I'm not going</font>

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,450
to go into the heavy technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> details</font>

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,909
so it's mainly just an overview of what

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,670
we did so the collaborators were people

27
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,009
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Caltech slack that Stanford Linear</font>

Accelerator Center Los Alamos fern and

29
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,390
then we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people helping from</font>

30
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,880
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> garment to start oh Linda wink</font>

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">listen start starlight and then they</font>

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,880
were various<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp data tag starlight Tara</font>

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,979
grid surf net and Cisco and level 3 and

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,380
Intel and then there's some funding from

35
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,509
the do<font color="#CCCCCC"> II European Commission and the</font>

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,429
National Science Foundation you can see

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:47,290
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pretty logos that everybody has</font>

38
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:49,750
so what was done well we set a new tcp

39
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,700
land speed record and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measures the record is it's</font>

41
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,640
the speed of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data transfer times the</font>

42
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,340
distance so it's typically measured in

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,610
terabit meters per second so this one

44
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,619
the record was<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten thousand six hundred</font>

45
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nineteen terabit meters per second</font>

46
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:09,850
because it's fairly easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transmit</font>

47
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,290
data over short distances similarly

48
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:16,269
comes when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a large congestion</font>

49
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:21,190
window with<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP so the first in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> November</font>

50
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:23,170
at we succeed in doing 8.6 gigabits a

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,810
second across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the u.s. that was from</font>

52
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,510

53
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten parallel streams there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

55
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,590
other end and the internet land speed

56
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:39,010
record specifies that can only be one

57
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:41,320
cpu at either end so in that sense that

58
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,970
was not a internet to land speed record

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:48,519
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time that we sent from</font>

61
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:56,140
megabits a second and that that was

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">using jumbo frames 9000 bike frames then</font>

63
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:03,399
in sunnyvale in February we got at this

64
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">time we got Intel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 gige Nick cards and</font>

65
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,670
so we had another crack at it and this

66
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,580
time we got 2.38 gigabits a second from

67
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:15,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">sunnyvale to Geneva again with jumbo</font>

68
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,320
frames and this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 99% of</font>

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,059
the available bandwidth you could put

70
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,579
over since it was a packet over silently

71
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,910
and you gotta lie for headers etc the

72
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,940
little grasp that you can see shows you

73
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,890
the gigabits per second along the

74
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,650
left-hand axis and along the bottom

75
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,380
which is time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

76
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:38,390
the right they pegs out at roughly 2.2

77
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,060
36 gigabits a second for over an hour

78
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:44,510
so that was actually transferring over a

79
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:48,350
terabyte in one hour from in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

80
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:51,519
sunnyvale to Geneva so how was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it done</font>

81
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:55,100
well at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sunnyvale in the level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

82
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:59,090
gateway we had a GSR router which is

83
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,810
kind of loaned to us by Cisco we had a

<font color="#E5E5E5">large number of CPUs one you and for you</font>

t6 40 juniper router and then internal

91
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,710
to that a 7609 which then had more cpus

92
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,359
and then across the data tags link

93
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,919
across the Atlantic<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-and-a-half</font>

99
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">was and then to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CERN where they were</font>

100
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:46,099
which is in Geneva Switzerland where

101
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:48,909
there were more more service so here are

102
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of typical components you can see</font>

103
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:57,229
down at the bottom right there's the GSR

104

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see the site the size of the</font>

110
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,830
card because the ascent piece sitting on

111
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,469
the heatsink kind of interesting to see

112
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:22,000
how big the heatsink it occupies almost

113
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:24,710
half of the card we were using we use

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,510
that for the last test the original test

115
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:31,780
we're using disconnect<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick cards so</font>

116
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,870
let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think i'm gonna skip</font>

117
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,119
next one so what were the trip what were

118
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:42,669
the challenges in this well it's a pci

119
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:46,660
bus limitation 66 megahertz 64-bit CPU a

120
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:48,729
pci bus can do 4.2 gigabits at best so

121
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,780
we actually in the latter tests we made

122
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,669
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had hundred and thirty-three</font>

megahertz the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpu pci bus at</font>

124
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-and-a-half gigabits per second and</font>

125
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,750
180 millisecond round-trip time that was

126
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,639
discern we needed 120 megabyte windows

127
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,440
so these pcs had to have plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

128
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,770
memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> in them so that they could</font>

129
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,630
accommodate that window fairly easily we

130
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,789
ran into some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tools which we are</font>

131
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,760
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the testing BBC p which is a</font>

133
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,280
bigger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 megabytes so we did match</font>

134
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,590
so we didn't wind up using that slow

135
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,559
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a one gigabit second takes</font>

136
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:29,320
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five to six seconds on 180</font>

138
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,530
measure ninety percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,190
gigabyte gigabit per second in order to

144
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to run for that amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

145
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,530
so you need a fair manner<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk at both</font>

146
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:53,350
ends and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the problem with</font>

147
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,419
the standard TT piece back is with<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,750
additive increase in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mas progressive</font>

149
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:01,210
decrease that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as soon as you hit a loss</font>

150
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,960
it can take a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get back up</font>

151
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,940
since you're only adding one packet for

152
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,549
act<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back and you can see that</font>

153
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,760
down on the right there the bottom scale

154
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,970
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0-2 thousand seconds and you can see</font>

155
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,550
it only goes from about about 450 to

156
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,590
about 600 20 megabits in a thousand

157
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,870
seconds so it takes a long time so

158
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,489
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very sensitive to any loss this</font>

159
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,840
is a test circuit so there wasn't much

160
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,130
loss but in his last certainly would

161
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,130
back us down quite a lot

162
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,400
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of what was special it</font>

163
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,259
wasn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> measuring the speed on the</font>

164
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,219
backbone with a lot of aggregated links

165
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,550
it was actually an end-to-end

166
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:45,180
application one cpu at one in one cpu at

167
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:48,629
the other end we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> did try with</font>

168
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,220
multiple streams and single streams but

169
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:53,000
we were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually get good</font>

170
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:56,669
performance just using a single stream

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,889
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also illustrates quite nicely that</font>

172
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,750
even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP was designed for 56</font>

175
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,948
actually scales up to the multi gigabits

per second region and<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP is nice in the</font>

177
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,389
sense there are other protocols which

00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:14,250
you can use for transmitting data some

179
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,620
which are based on UDP the nice thing

<font color="#CCCCCC">about TCP is it's well understood its</font>

234
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,800
that the plane didn't have any delays

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:42,040
anything like that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be about 10</font>

236
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,040
hours and if you had a fully load in 747

237
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,010
and it took 10 hours to get from say Sam

238
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,170
sis go to Geneva then that's roughly two

239
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,120
to four terabytes second and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

240
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,979
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair because you then have to</font>

241
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,590
unload the tape shipping it off the

244
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:04,350
actually the turnaround is closer to two

245
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:06,240
weeks so who needs it well as I

246
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,940
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> after you left I know physics</font>

247
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,030

252
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,640
and as you already have databases which

253
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:28,020
are about well over three quarters of a

254
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:31,920
petabyte and in the that's doubling it

255
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,900
roughly each year so that in a decade we

256

367
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,650
that some of the people in the

measurement space did I thought was

370
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,130
interesting with they started measuring

371
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,730
not milliseconds but milliseconds per

372
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:38,529
mile and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the interesting</font>

373
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,120
ways to calibrate some of this is point
