157
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,350
we've had people show of the court order

158
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,510
saying there's a guy who's using the

163
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,009
don't have that and we have a loss

164
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:23,050
encrypted group and we give them the

165
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:25,810
encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> group but it doesn't do them</font>

166
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,419
any good that I'm aware of in fact in

167
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,660
one case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I confession time kinda we got</font>

168
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:34,448
a subpoena I love my lawyers they're

169
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:37,210
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good lawyer's lawyer says is the</font>

170
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,979
person who this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> after a student</font>

171
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,109
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have also two special laws</font>

172
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:44,349
about students and I said I have no way

173
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:47,970
of knowing because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't tell so then</font>

174
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:52,449
the lawyer says might it be a student

175
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:53,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said it might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a student this is</font>

176
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,210
well then we can't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the subpoena it</font>

177
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,340
has to be a court order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around</font>

178
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,859
the family education records Protection

179
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,690
Act so we went back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy something</font>

180
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">said this latina is not going to cut it</font>

181
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,430
because it might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a student therefore</font>

182
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,949
you need this court order by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way if</font>

183
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,270
you go to the court and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this</font>

184
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,610
court order which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know is not an easy</font>

185
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,479
thing for you to do right now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

186
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,349
going to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bunch of</font>

187
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:20,050
encrypted poop and so they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother</font>

188
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:22,210
and so I'm using this service the day

189
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,270
that we are forced to shut it down will

190
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,090
be a dark day on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Oh the</font>

191
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,990
point being that once upon a time

192
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,299
someone told me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you want</font>

193
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,490
something kept private don't put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

194
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,710
the net

195
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:38,960
as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it goes on the net assume</font>

196
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:42,270
that it's not private and that made that

197
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,508
advices seem to hold me in good stead

198
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,948
over the years I'm assuming that as soon

199
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:49,380
as I put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net somebody</font>

200
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:52,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere is going to want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to examine</font>

201
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:57,360
those bits for their personal enjoyment

202
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:58,979
certainly that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a safe strategy though</font>

203
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,949
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> never control what others might</font>

204
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:07,550
send you great time we return in one

205
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,550
half an hour

206
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:20,389
I don't care if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another talk I</font>

207
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,389
want a break thank you
