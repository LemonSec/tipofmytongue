<font color="#E5E5E5">thrilled to be at nine a.m. on tuesday</font>

16
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,180
morning but actually this is pretty

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,280
exciting because as a one-time groupie

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,899
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Frank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Allison and the odd socks being</font>

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,780
the warm-up band for Dave cats is a

20
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:05,760
really big deal so so anyway um for

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">those of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know sue harrison i</font>

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,420
used to be his biggest fans and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we used</font>

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,659
to stand in front and jump up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,450
and scream Dave when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you play</font>

25
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:17,130
and he would he would blush so I did

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,740
bicycle across the country and I have

27
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,509
some cheesy photos and mostly because I

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned a few things across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the country</font>

29
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:27,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">that actually applied in networking and</font>

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,150
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really twisted way so anyway um I saw</font>

31
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,270
lots of interesting things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been to</font>

32
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,460
Fred Texas which is a mecca I missed

33
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">mozzie head Florida because it we had</font>

34
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,639
tornadoes that day I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,740
exciting hope baptist church we're not

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,060
really sure why it was exciting but we

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:51,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">took a picture it is me with my fuzzy</font>

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,090
cat ears anyway but one of the things i

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,860
learned across the country is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

40
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,210
know in theory everybody who built the

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,160
network's knows if there's this fiber

42
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,710
that goes across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country but</font>

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually for many hundreds of miles i</font>

44
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,690
rode right alongside of it and i saw the

45
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,250
little signs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i learned that there</font>

46
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,199
are many uses for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> junction</font>

47
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,880
facilities that you dispatch people to

48
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,238
that don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anything to do with</font>

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,340
networking so anyway this is an

50
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,459
alligator<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we saw and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did make it</font>

51
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the way to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Florida so with that I'll</font>

52
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,829
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,410
it was the best of times it was the

54
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:34,049
worst of times anyway so we were having

55
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,970
a discussion and Andrew and Curtis

56
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,650
decided that there's a network that

57
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,890
people could talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> because doesn't</font>

58
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,110
exist anymore and so they asked me if I

59
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,458
would talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so I'm going to talk</font>

60
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,020
a little bit about at home and certainly

61
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,840
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

62
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,330
that I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in and there's a</font>

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,070
lot more they could be probably gleaned

64
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,470
from the experience but this is just

65
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,230
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a slice at it that will fit in a</font>

66
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:02,370
half an<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour so i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there from january</font>

67
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,470
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1996 until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> march of two thousand so I</font>

68
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,350
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no network we had no</font>

69
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,989
cable modems it was a pretty interesting

70
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:14,690
time and it's also could be titled in my

71
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:17,790
ears without sleep so we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have them</font>

72
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,560
anyway so what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is</font>

73
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,989
some of the things that happened when we

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">rolled out the network the important</font>

75
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,340
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it isn't is a discussion</font>

76
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:31,859
of why at home went out of business I

77
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:34,739
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the merits of at home</font>

78
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,110
buying excite what Milo's really like

79
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,760
because we could talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that offline</font>

80
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,970
but we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it</font>

81
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,910
here and anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about really cable</font>

82
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,739
company politics the thing you will note

83
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,109
is that the slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are on the web</font>

84
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,730
although they remotely resemble the

85
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,959
slides you're going to see there are

86
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,209
things that have been changed and I

87
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,410
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the font so that you</font>

88
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:02,480
could pick them out as we go along

89
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:08,800
I am what would that<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting to</font>

90
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:12,109
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so first I thought I stole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

91
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:15,620
original slides of what the network was

92
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:19,549
supposed to look like and what at home

93
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:22,340
was was it was a an organization that

94
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:24,229
decided that for better or for worse

95
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,239
that maybe the cable guys didn't really

96
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,880
know how to do IP so maybe we could

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,130
provide this service we're at home built

98
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,290
this network and provided<font color="#E5E5E5"> this service</font>

99
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:37,070
of you know IP data services for cable

100
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:40,040
companies so we provided IP services for

101
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,480
20 different<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 some-odd different cable</font>

102
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,610
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> in home and the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

103
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,850
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> countries and</font>

104
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:49,010
so we had issues that each individual

105
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:53,540
cable company might have but the scale

106
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:55,880
of them was pretty amazing because

107
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,220
everybody has their own requirements it

108
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">included sort of you know email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nat news</font>

109
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,180
we configured the cable modems we

110
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,730
configured the cable head<font color="#E5E5E5"> and gear I</font>

111
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,290
mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much well anyway I'll</font>

112
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,250
talk some more about it but that's what

113
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,410
at home was

114
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,449
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the this is what we</font>

115
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,300
called the cloud talk and this is what

116
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:18,630
the network well and for some

117
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,580
approximation<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked like so we had a</font>

118
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:25,800
backbone that was originally sprint ATM

119
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:28,419
service which well that was fun and

120
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,460
eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it became up you know we</font>

121
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:32,740
leased fiber and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and progress</font>

122
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,570
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the regional networks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

123
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,729
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more about the different parts</font>

124
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:41,040
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network but the regional networks</font>

125
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:43,210
were actually built on existing cable

126
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,130
infrastructures in different areas I'll

127
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,650
talk some more about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

128
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">RDC was where there were multiples of</font>

129
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:53,710
these where we provided the you know the

130
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,480
services like that news and email and

131
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,669
stuff for different regions

132
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,330
we had different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hearing</font>

133
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:03,820
connections to other<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs we connected</font>

134
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:08,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the maze we connected to the kicks I</font>

135
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:10,870
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be gotta love the kicks actually</font>

136
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">well I won't talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it here but the</font>

137
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:16,450
kicks was kind of crucial there for a

138
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,880
while we also had an organization called

139
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,130
at work that sold<font color="#CCCCCC"> lease line services to</font>

140
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,010
businesses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk some more about</font>

141
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,490
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had deals with different</font>

142
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,140
content providers so we did lots of

143
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">online content we had this really really</font>

144
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">neat content group that that did a lot</font>

145
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">of really creative stuff they were</font>

146
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,970
fondly referred to as the arts and

147
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,380
crafts group and we've informed some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

148
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:46,650
our management that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might not like</font>

149
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:50,350
that so in a regional<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and again</font>

150
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,729
this is sort of how it wasn't theory you

151
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,100
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this in</font>

152
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,870
practice but basically we had a backbone

153
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,520
router hearse and multiple backbone

154
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,820
routers that connected into the backbone

155
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,219
and then we had regional services and

156
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,580
then we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> had regional routers that</font>

157
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,680
connected out to the cable goop<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

158
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,419
also in the end had aggregation routers

159
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,660
that connected and out

160
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,340
and other kinds of leased line services

161
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:19,360
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> regions we been the backbone</font>

162
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:21,669
we're an ospf let's see and the regional

163
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,770
networks are kind of cool because the

164
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">cable guys actually had a lot of fiber</font>

165
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,479
they had sonnet they had ATM so what we

166
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,280
did was you know sometimes they gave us

167
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,730
dark fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> handoff sometimes they gave</font>

168
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,140
us you know PVCs on their ATM sometimes

169
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,540
they gave us and us from their sonic

170
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,969
year so we were actually lighting these

171
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,190
you know in 96 these really long fiber

172
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,560
runs with these little itty bitty fiber

173
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,410
transceivers from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israel that kind of</font>

174
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,090
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of worked and you know wrapping</font>

175
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,350
fiber around pencils to get enough

176
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:55,289
attenuation

177
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:58,560
it was a pretty interesting time it was

178
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:02,850
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun actually but no sleep okay</font>

179
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,950
so in the regional data center there was

180
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,050
you know a switch and we had different

181
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,150
you know our network management goop we

182
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,180
had high availability servers that did

183
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,090
mail and news and all that stuff there's

184
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,670
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more goop here on the slide but</font>

185
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,429
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> they the theory was that if if</font>

186
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,380
a regional a region<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network got</font>

187
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,360
disconnected from the backbone that the

188
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,580
customers could still reach the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RDC and</font>

189
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,900
get some of their services you know

190
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,330
their mail that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> queued up or</font>

191
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:35,419
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know that kind of sort</font>

192
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:37,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">of worked there were lots of challenges</font>

193
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,059
and then in a head end this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

194
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,159
where the IP meets the cable stuff so

195
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,660
there's the CMT<font color="#E5E5E5"> s which must have you</font>

196
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,040
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> already you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we know what</font>

197
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,260
all the scoop is but basically it's a

198
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,300
box that connects IP on one side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> RF</font>

199
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,850
on the other side and we had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

200
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,189
those and the scale probably one of the

201
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,680
scaling problems that we had was that

202
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,389
since we dealt with 20 different ISPs I

203
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,349
mean I'm sorry 20 different cable

204
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:05,000
providers or even more we had an

205
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,850
abundance of different kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable</font>

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,290
headed gear so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cisco guys</font>

207
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,639
came in in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end and they were saying</font>

208
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh well our box does all these things</font>

209
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:16,459
and I'm like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rolas and</font>

210
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:17,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">LAN cities and HP's and you know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

211
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">great that your box does all these</font>

212
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:21,290
things but you know I have you know a

213
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,569
gajillion of these other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

214
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,670
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make work too so that made it</font>

215
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,399
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit harder than just a</font>

216
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,719
cable company trying to do IP because we

217
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,630
had we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all this equipment</font>

218
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,570
work let's see what else is interesting

219
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,810
about this

220
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:41,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other things</font>

221
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:44,439
that that we tried to do was to keep the

222
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:47,530
traffic as local as possible so each of

223
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,180
the not every head end but it depended

224
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,300
on the amount of subscribers but we did

225
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,880
a lot of caching and proxy server stuff

226
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,910
and it wasn't transparent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font>

227
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,990
some more about that in a little bit but

228
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:03,850
we tried to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

229
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,040
if you were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that you</font>

230
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,450
should be able to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as fast as your</font>

231
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,069
connection will allow you but if you're

232
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,820
doing something to the outside world

233
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:17,380
then you know it depended and I'll talk

234
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:19,150
some more about that later so some of

235
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,530
the key points<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network had</font>

236
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,100
multiple layers that did different

237
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:25,600
things and again it was to push the the

238
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,190
traffic closer to the user to try to

239
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,930
keep it from going across the inner

240
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,510
connects as much as possible that sort

241
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,880
of thing caching and replication was a

242
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,220
big deal we had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the early harvest</font>

243
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,700
guys working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some of the stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

244
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:43,780
we did even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lai used to say we</font>

245
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,670
had ubiquitous multicast it was a lie it

246
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,850
was a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory but we could never</font>

247
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,500
manage to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and and I'm going</font>

248
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk a little bit about quality of</font>

249
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,210
service in our environment because it

250
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,940
really didn't apply I mean it couldn't

251
00:10:55,210 --> 00:11:00,540
be used because you know everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

252
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:04,690
their view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what end-to-end is and</font>

253
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:07,810
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a lot smaller scope so</font>

254
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,640
again some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that that were</font>

255
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,170
the original assertions were that if you

256
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,790
had fat pipes it wouldn't us you can

257
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,490
always just throw a band with that it

258
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,900
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smarter the</font>

259
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">network should have intelligence built</font>

260
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,840
in this pretty much comes right from

261
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:25,600
Milo's old talk you need good network

262
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,580
management you know and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font>

263
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that was always a vision</font>

264
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,120
and actually is a lot closer to being a

265
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,580
reality is that you could go down too

266
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,070
well in California be fries by a cable

267
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,170
modem like you buy a dial-up modem plug

268
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:41,050
it in and you know get registered with

269
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,819
some cable service and be online and

270
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,890
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis that's a lot closer to being</font>

271
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,960
reality and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks at home</font>

272
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,880
worked really hard to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis to</font>

273
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,880
reality which is a cable modem standard

274
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,790
for those of you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know which</font>

275
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,280
was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty helpful so one of</font>

276
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,680
the one of the decisions that was made

277
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,110
that for better<font color="#E5E5E5"> or for worse we lived</font>

278
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,020
with was this concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of using dhcp</font>

279
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,430
client ID and and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the surface</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

280
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,620
it's really elegant you know you sign

281
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,410
your subscriber up and you give them

282
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">this subscriber ID and then that ends up</font>

283
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,160
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the client ID field so you</font>

284
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:20,030
always know who they are and you can

286
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,829
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best thing because not all</font>

287
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,990
the machines did client ID so a lot of

288
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:30,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">people you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had they ended up</font>

289
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,210
not being able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use DHCP because they</font>

290
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,770
couldn't they couldn't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it their</font>

291
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,230
software wouldn't allow them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

292
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,750
client ID there<font color="#CCCCCC"> there were lots of</font>

293
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,610
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it you couldn't you</font>

294
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,160
couldn't riad<font color="#CCCCCC"> resses easily you know</font>

295
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,290
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using dhcp you know</font>

296
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,240
and everybody has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp and address</font>

297
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,709
from the dhcp server if you split a node

298
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,100
and create<font color="#CCCCCC"> more bandwidth which I'll</font>

299
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,780
talk about in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple minutes you know</font>

300
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,490
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy to redress everybody</font>

301
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,110
and you know people figure it out pretty

302
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,580
quickly if they statically configure

303
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,100
that you know that's a bad thing to do

304
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,570
because then they're offline and we saw

305
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,960
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cable providers</font>

306
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:10,030
that we worked with and and you know it

307
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:13,550
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my favorite decisions so</font>

308
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,410
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my early experiences at a cable</font>

309
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">show if you haven't been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a cable show</font>

310
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,850
it's a lot like<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop except that if</font>

311
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,200
you focus in you can meet Adam West and

312
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,320
have your picture taken with Hulk Hogan

313
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,890
and and when a herb garden from the

314
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,360
garden channel and we were we were we

315
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,400
had our first booth and it really wasn't

316
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,440
actually the at<font color="#E5E5E5"> home service it was kind</font>

317
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,209
of cheating and and one of the guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

318
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,800
work with was explaining to<font color="#CCCCCC"> these people</font>

319
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's two ways to make</font>

320
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,120
more bandwidth one way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make more</font>

321
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,820
bandwidth is to use another TV channel

322
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,290
so so a cable cable service is done in

323
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,550
like chant you know channel I don't know

324
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,560
if the equivalent of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Channel</font>

325
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">five or whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really because</font>

326
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,630
that's too important to channel but it

327
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,830
uses those six megahertz TV channels so

328
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,480
on the other way you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is you</font>

329
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,610
can split<font color="#E5E5E5"> up nodes and one of the</font>

330
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,050
it was working at our booth said and we

331
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,079
were surrounded<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the equestrian</font>

332
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,870
channel the garden channel fit TV which

333
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:08,209
they did aerobics every five minutes and

334
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,829
he said and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look around here you</font>

335
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:14,660
can see several channels that could be

336
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:17,089
shall we say reallocated so anyway that

337
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">was one of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> early that sticks in my</font>

338
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,300
mind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to make more bandwidth</font>

339
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,189
because you know once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the</font>

340
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,910
cable show you think wow you know who

341
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,790
buys these stations so when you split

342
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,779
nodes you have to redress and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'ma</font>

343
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">addressing was always the bane of my</font>

344
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,220
existence so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to probably</font>

345
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,899
hear more about it than you care to

346
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,029
let's see oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing is if</font>

347
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:40,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make more bandwidth using</font>

348
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:42,649
more TV channels then you can't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

349
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,839
know the equestrian channel and you know

350
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:49,660
fit TV and Hulk Hogan's adventures or

351
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:52,790
whatever so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might lose revenue so we</font>

352
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,279
had an interesting cultural clash of IP

353
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,589
people meeting cable people and some of

354
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,389
them were really cool with IP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

355
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:01,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">course we knew nothing about cable so</font>

356
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:02,480
you know I can't really say that you

357
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there was a lot of clue on both</font>

358
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,769
sides but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interesting thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

359
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,029
cable companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the US at the time</font>

360
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:09,920
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were all these little</font>

361
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:12,410
mom-and-pop companies that got bought by

362
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,810
these big companies so there was like

363
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,630
corporate right and then there were all

364
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,790
these little little independently run

365
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,040
little regional things so some of them

366
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,589
were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really amazing like the guys</font>

367
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,689
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bay Area and one of the markets</font>

368
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:28,790
were just you know they taught us about

369
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,050
fiber we taught them about routing I

370
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,110
mean it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wonderful and then</font>

371
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:35,540
there was you know Joe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

372
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:39,199
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nowhere who it's like you got</font>

373
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,790
what so it was a really interesting and

374
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,349
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there was corporate</font>

375
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,899
saying we're doing this out home thing

376
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:49,790
so there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of interesting</font>

377
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:52,490
interactions and and to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> CMT s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gear</font>

378
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">was good cmcs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key or did RF well because</font>

379
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,790
that was their thing cable was their

380
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,290
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know they didn't want</font>

381
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,699
anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mess up their cables just</font>

382
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,240
like we didn't want anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mess up</font>

383
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:04,859
our ospf so it was an interesting time

384
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,740
so I have to tell a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of these</font>

385
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,569
stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I can't help myself so I</font>

386
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,610
was in I was in the sunnyvale head end

387
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,800
one day and there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a man explaining</font>

388
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to our server guy there was a man who</font>

389
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,779
brought the CMT s<font color="#E5E5E5"> there explaining to</font>

390
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:20,129
the server guy hey you know I know it

391
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,589
doesn't work but if you just point

392
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:24,449
default it my<font color="#CCCCCC"> see mts you know it'll</font>

393
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:26,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">work and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was pulling cable</font>

394
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:27,719
and trying to ignore the whole thing but

395
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:29,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">I couldn't help myself so I went around</font>

396
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the corner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was explaining to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

397
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,519
man<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point to fault at him</font>

398
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,290
but then the world got really small

399
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,500
because my router was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font>

400
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,089
his wasn't so so we had this long

401
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,319
discussion where he informed me that I

402
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,060
really didn't know how to hook to the

403
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,310
internet and that I should talk to his

404
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,479
his his guy at you you net because

405
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,969
clearly I didn't know what I was talking

406
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,889
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I told</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just humor me and</font>

407
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,360
configure it and later that day I found

408
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:53,850
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he was the guy who wrote the</font>

409
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,709
routing software in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CMT s so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

410
00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:01,939
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid oh and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know said the</font>

411
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:04,309
early the early<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmcs was well challenged</font>

412
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:06,270
we had a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different vendors and</font>

413
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,699
even when they said they were a router

414
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:11,339
well that was a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a stretch</font>

415
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,250
some of them were bridges which you know

416
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,708
had their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems they certainly</font>

417
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,419
didn't really understand cider which

418
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:20,490
I'll tell you about in a little bit and

419
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,579
and they didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand why r</font>

420
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,189
it v1 really wasn't well some kind of

421
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:30,090
combination of RIT v1 and a little bit

422
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:31,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">of v2 really wasn't routing and we</font>

423
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,350
learned a lot about why you need filters

424
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,360
in the modems when we started hooking up

425
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,520
customers because people could actually

426
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,360
print to their neighbors printer and

427
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,230
stuff which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was pretty cool and made for</font>

428
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of harmonious living environments</font>

429
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,679
and you know and now you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to</font>

430
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,210
the security thing last night and I was

431
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking oh my god you know what do they</font>

432
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,360
do it now because you know they were

433
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,190
just doing harmless accidental things

434
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,699
back then you know now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to be</font>

435
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,740
it's got to be really scary so so the

436
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,230
original equipment we had no big secret

437
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,299
motorola and<font color="#CCCCCC"> lan city and and i'm sure</font>

438
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know to be honest all this</font>

439
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:12,389
equipment has changed a lot since 1996

440
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,059
so but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of head</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rippy one on</font>

441
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:18,030
the motorolas and the only subnet it

442
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:22,230
recognized was a / 24 and you could put

443
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:25,530
20 / 24 s on a CMT s but not 32 not 16

444
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:29,190
not eight but 20 which you know was

445
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:31,049
really fun the land cities were bridges

446
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,580
and so you know you had to be really

447
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:35,610
careful what you did on your on your

448
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,110
Ethernet and then later there were

449
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,270
others and like I said docsis was

450
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,340
certainly a breath of fresh air I mean

451
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,530
you know nothing's perfect but boy it

452
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,199
was a lot better and the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to</font>

453
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,330
remember about at home was that at<font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font>

454
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,179
didn't pick the CMT s the cable guys did

455
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:56,039
so you know we had a certification

456
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:57,149
process where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we said you</font>

457
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,919
know here's the ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> crossed the</font>

458
00:18:57,149 --> 00:19:01,620
bar you know sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they barely</font>

459
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">crossed the bar but we didn't pick them</font>

460
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:09,000
so we ended up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of interesting</font>

461
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:11,399
equipment so so the first at home of a

462
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,740
deployment came and for those of you

463
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:16,139
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I collect quotes so you know</font>

464
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,090
nobody's safe from being quoted so one

465
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,330
of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> early beta customers was never</font>

466
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,280
satisfied thanks Tony<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he said he</font>

467
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">only got 800 k and at the time you know</font>

468
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">800 cake was pretty awesome but you know</font>

469
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:31,500
he does say that 250 and his<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion</font>

470
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,669
I'll buy you a double latte so you know

471
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:38,070
anyway the other I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes oh my</font>

472
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:40,289
god so one of the early things that

473
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,270
happened was that we took a cable cut

474
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:44,309
we'd hook somebody up cable guy would go

475
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,690
out hook him up then the next guy would

476
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:49,260
go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say oh that's noise and</font>

477
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,030
filter room so so that was fun I guess

478
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,870
I'll speed up we had a guy who plugged

479
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,610
in ISDN

480
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,560
cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TN modem into the land and</font>

481
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,169
proxy arced for everybody which was

482
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,200
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool and this was the what our</font>

483
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,880
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer actually said and you</font>

484
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:11,020
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff up you</font>

485
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:14,890
just can't so anyway um so needless to

486
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,420
say we got 24 / 14 not 24 / 8 but thanks

487
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn Duran who would only listen to</font>

488
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,610
24 / 8 announcements it depended<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font>

489
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,810
day whether you could get to sprint or

490
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,790
not whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whether you were</font>

491
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:27,850
the lucky one that that they believed

492
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,500
which was pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool we had probably</font>

493
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,629
six or seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble tickets a day</font>

494
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,150
sometimes more of routers that didn't

495
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,490
have IP classless turned on and we had

496
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,430
no mechanism to get more which was

497
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty scary lots of people thought at</font>

498
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 was Infinite and since all the cable</font>

499
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,669
modems were out of net 10 that was kind

500
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,800
of a drag because they just didn't get

501
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:53,950
it they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to go get more RFC</font>

502
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:57,610
1918 space we had this back office

503
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:59,500
system that and and that you know had to

504
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">integrate everything from everybody</font>

505
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,660
else's back office systems so that was

506
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,970
pretty tough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nobody ever got all the</font>

507
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,860
functionality they wanted because they

508
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">all had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their systems and you know</font>

509
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,629
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a two-year integration</font>

510
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:16,240
process which was kind of a drag open

511
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,770
access provided other challenges and I

512
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,960
think it still does I'm on the Aaron

513
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,629
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> council or advisory council and</font>

514
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,920
and we're still dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

515
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,720
what do you do for address space but

516
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,660
basically it's hooking more than one isp

517
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,630
to a cable head end or to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cable</font>

518
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:33,340
infrastructure it was for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

519
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,720
kind of schizophrenic because we had

520
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,250
just apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in Canada because was</font>

521
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,290
mandated but we were fighting it in the

522
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because nobody wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so it was</font>

523
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:44,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of hard to solve it and not solve</font>

524
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,820
it all at the same time that I think the

525
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,710
key thing that's still happening right

526
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,409
now the takeaway from this would be that

527
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,390
multiple organizations are applying for

528
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:55,330
address space for the same physical same

529
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:57,490
exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> no number of homes so there might</font>

530
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,639
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 homes and there's five ISPs that</font>

531
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,740
are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Aaron and say</font>

532
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,990
I need address space for these 500 homes

533
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,440
which you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could easily over</font>

534
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,720
over a sign and then there's a lot of

535
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,200
routing issues with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but since I</font>

536
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,680
don't have enough time we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> skip it now</font>

537
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,110
that network management the thing that I

538
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,880
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> should happen with CMT s is that I</font>

539
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,429
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there should be a way for the</font>

540
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,290
cable guys to manage the for one<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

541
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage the RF part in another group</font>

542
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,670
to manage the IP part and all the access

543
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,440
schemes to the routers at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

544
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:33,230
different access levels but they didn't

545
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,260
tease apart the different functionality

546
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,490
so we had a lot of issues with who's

547
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,080
going to manage the routers are they

548
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,700
going to be in the routing system are

549
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">they going to run you know god forbid if</font>

550
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,330
they do ospf you know how they're going

551
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,220
to do it and are they going to run it so

552
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,919
we static routed to all the can't see

553
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,200
mts because you know we just couldn't

554
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,610
you know they ran different protocols we

555
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,410
didn't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they worked we didn't</font>

556
00:22:52,610 --> 00:23:00,560
you know we had multiple groups multiple

557
00:22:54,410 --> 00:23:02,240
organizations managing them let's see we

558
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,820
had a lot of problems because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

559
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,820
with ospf externals because all the

560
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,560
static routes became externals and the

561
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,240
NOC decided that the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve every</font>

562
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,190
problem was to redistribute connected

563
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,050
which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> every interface every</font>

564
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,320
interface subnet becomes an external

565
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:20,659
even if you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to and for</font>

566
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,340
those of you who haven't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you</font>

567
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,690
keep the number of externals down and

568
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:28,370
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> always PF that's all I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

569
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,720
it's just really ugly so another issue

570
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,810
we had was it with all you can eat for

571
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:36,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">3995 and people weren't using the</font>

572
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,240
proxies they were bypassing them lots of

573
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,620
things weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> cacheable as you'll see</font>

574
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,630
from yet another quote so we had a lot

575
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,330
of issues and and they suck down a lot

576
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:49,940
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than they sent so all the QoS</font>

577
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,919
mechanisms didn't really work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us I</font>

578
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distinguish two million</font>

579
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,570
subscribers from the nap you know and

580
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,310
say oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy gets this much into him</font>

581
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that guy gets that much so we had a</font>

582
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,820
lot of those kinds of issues

583
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,889
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came here and presented this thing</font>

584
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,270
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco's committed access rate</font>

585
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,940
because that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the really great</font>

586
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,410
ideas for solving the problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font>

587
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,930
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that and found that of</font>

588
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,240
course that wouldn't be useful most of

589
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,010
the QoS mechanisms aren't really end to

590
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,590
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they didn't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help our</font>

591
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,450
problems so it was really hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell</font>

592
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,429
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> levels of service unless you</font>

593
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:27,190
limited at the cable modem which meant

594
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:29,560
that the on net as fast as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can off</font>

595
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,000
net slower thing never really worked we

596
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,139
just ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to limit at the</font>

597
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,160
cable modem um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> love this at home isn't</font>

598
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,970
changing the world we're just

599
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,460
facilitating existing vices we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots</font>

600
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,840
of problems with open relays people miss

configuring their software people

602
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploiting that that's no big surprise</font>

603
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:52,030
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> posted their own their personal</font>

604
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,770
900 number and decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kathy at home net</font>

605
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,170
was a really great return address so I

606
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:58,510
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting email from around</font>

607
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,720
the globe we had a live sex cam in

608
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,430
sunnyvale we had people playing video

609
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,080
games that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like the fact that</font>

610
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:10,450
that they could kill the dial-up guys

611
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:13,030
before the dial-up guys saw them<font color="#E5E5E5"> um we</font>

612
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,950
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of kids like the son of one of</font>

613
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,720
the big cable providers owners made

614
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,480
somebody mad in a chat room and then

615
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,160
they you know the denial of service

616
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,430
attack took out you know half of the

617
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,170
backbone before we found it so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it</font>

618
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,280
was a joy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it grew every day because</font>

619
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:33,760
we were hooking up so many subscribers

620
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,860
so this was a quote from the guy who did

621
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,580
a lot of the product planning for at

622
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:42,310
work it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at least it actually submit</font>

623
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,929
our traffic more symmetrical so the

624
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,310
cable guys were sucking the cable

625
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,410
subscribers were sucking stuff down the

626
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,460
at work customers were had traffic the

627
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,790
other way which helped a lot with

628
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:54,160
peering we we did really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well just</font>

629
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">because for a while the customer service</font>

630
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">was good and people were so unhappy with</font>

631
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,260
the big guys that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought from at</font>

632
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,260
work which was kind of cool

633
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:09,770
so in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end I think that that what one</font>

634
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,439
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big problems that we had was just</font>

635
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,270
this the scale of trying to do what we

636
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,740
were trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for as many cable</font>

637
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,120
providers as we were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it at</font>

638
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">least from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my perspective that you know</font>

639
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,179
God knows there were certainly a lot of

640
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:24,440
other a lot of other hurdles but

641
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,360
everybody had requirements everybody had

642
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,430
back office systems everybody had you

643
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,199
know some weird thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they wanted</font>

644
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do on their cable plan or appear over</font>

645
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,500
a cable modem with some isp and you know

646
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:38,209
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just hard for you know a</font>

647
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,280
smaller group I mean it was still pretty

648
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:44,270
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end but it was hard to make</font>

649
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:46,220
everybody happy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so again we had a</font>

650
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,980
lot of problems with ospf scaling and

651
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,630
externals we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of problems with</font>

652
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,700
peering bandwidth endless endless

653
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,350
problems we had we know one percent of

654
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,020
our users use ninety percent of the

655
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,639
bandwidth you know and in the minute you

656
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,320
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to them another one</font>

657
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,740
percent of the users came up and started

658
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:07,070
using and you know it's hard at 3995<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

659
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">hop to deal with that lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

660
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,419
interesting regional peering like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

661
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:14,230
people who wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appear with you</font>

662
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:17,200
over a cable modem in their sons garage

663
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:22,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was tempting and</font>

664
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:25,820
and just to conclude our group found

665
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:27,770
that that that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have as little</font>

666
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,909
sleep as we head for as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

667
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,230
that you have to keep your sense of

668
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,020
humor and one of the guys in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my group</font>

00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,760
who helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this presentation found</font>

670
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,770
the list we called it the why don't you

671
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,810
just list just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like why don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font>

676
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:52,430
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> why don't we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just redistribute</font>

677
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:56,150
full internet routes into ospf and and

678
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:58,340
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> at you laughs but but myla really</font>

679
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:01,070
wanted to do this and so we all agreed

680
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,570
we all agreed early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that that we had</font>

681
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,040
the passwords and he didn't and if we

682
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:07,840
all stuck together we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could just tell</font>

him we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did it even though we didn't</font>

684
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,860
why don't we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just put it all of that</font>

685
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,030
works T ones into area 0 so we'll know

686
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,379
when they flop why don't we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just took</font>

687
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,539
them together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what breaks and</font>

688
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,640
this was actually what someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggested</font>

689
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:24,049
when we bought excite why don't we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

690
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,650
plug our networks together and see what

691
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:28,850
breaks lovely and this is mine on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

692
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,350
favorites why don't we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just ugh meant</font>

693
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,439
our backbone connection to the local pub

694
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:36,969
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> load-balanced cable modem link</font>

695
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,970
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>
