1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:05,040
last time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave this presentation was</font>

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,860
in Memphis<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was wearing Elvis get</font>

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,969
up I promised I wouldn't do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again but</font>

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,709
the presentation went to give you here

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,660
is a update on what aaron has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing</font>

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,910
about lame delegations in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reverse</font>

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,430
map that we put zones that we are

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,930
serving background this is that our

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,439
membership is decided they want lame

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,340
delegations to be handled somehow get

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,529
them out of the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they do</font>

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,219
cause a problem for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the</font>

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,170
staff has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> busy trying to get this</font>

14
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,460
policy implemented we've been working on

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,040
it now for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months we've seen</font>

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,149
some improvement on what's happening and

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,860
we're also sharing with the other

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,280
registries that are doing the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,730
what our experiences have been in the

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,500
background of this particular effort is

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,640
all pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much in last year starting in</font>

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,149
the spring of last year there was a

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,579
policy policy proposal made on our

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,699
public policy mailing list to say we

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,980
want lame delegations to go away there's

26
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,080
some discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the air in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the air in</font>

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,670
nine meeting over the summer we<font color="#E5E5E5"> measured</font>

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,200
how bad the problems we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,360
was a significant of problem to spend

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,119
time trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eliminate lame</font>

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,439
delegations following some more some

32
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,760
more discussion there was some more

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion in the next air and 10</font>

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,200
meeting that was in organ policy was

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,530
adopted and in December we began working

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,700
on the problem this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to next</font>

37
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,439
couple slides going to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,950
basically the policies asked the staff

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,470
to do and a policy is pretty much

40
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,939
oriented about who do we contact when we

41
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,369
have a problem as opposed to what is

42
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,559
lameness and what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

43
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:39,930
first part of this we have four phases

44
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,909
we have a test phase where we go out we

45
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,460
try to identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lane delegations to see</font>

46
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,930
what to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> test to see was out there</font>

47
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,110
then we get a fairly lengthy and

48
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,790
extensive contact process<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

49
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,049
thing we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we look at the network</font>

50
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,189
registrations that we have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

51
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,190
database and look at the points of

52
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,779
contact

53
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,460
first we first thing we do is eat

54
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,430
reading emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are</font>

55
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,020
attached to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the network block for</font>

56
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,170
which the zone is considered to be lame

57
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,090
or is suspected of being lame rather if

58
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,190
nothing happens then we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

59
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,370
autonomous system number record and see

60
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,930
who's the point of contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that AAS</font>

61
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,110
that's originating the route for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

62
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,000
prefix and if nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens then we</font>

63
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,220
try telephone to one of those points of

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,280
contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> if nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else if nothing</font>

65
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,840
happens till we try postal mail we try

66
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,260
sending out regular mail to the post

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,320
office and if still nothing happens we'd

68
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,429
go to an evaluation phase we decide have

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,930
we made sure we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what we're doing</font>

70
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">here make sure we've actually test this</font>

71
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,340
thing sufficiently and we wait 30 days

72
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,140
to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the postal mail to get through</font>

73
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,110
people to possibly respond to this

74
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,450
because the contact information we have

75
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,100
it can go back from creer in days we

76
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,010
don't know whether how to get through

77
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,930
somebody now for some the old networks

78
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,459
finally after 30 days go by with nothing

79
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,760
has happened we declared the delegation

80
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:00,010
to be lame and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way we we then go</font>

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">about removing a delegation by taking</font>

82
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,690
the NS records out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> update the</font>

83
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,070

84
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,470
registration block saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

85
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,510
tested this for lameness we found these

86
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,030
different problems this is the date it

87
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,799
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we did it did the update to</font>

88
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,590
the record and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally take it out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,680
DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the summary of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

90
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,810
policies asked us to do now what we've

91
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,430
done the staff is done to implement this

92
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,920
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we've got around with it with</font>

93
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,720
a testing tool that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> developed</font>

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,339
right now which does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of this</font>

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">test I have described here it asks for</font>

96
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the SOA record for the zones that are</font>

97
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,060
under test we try all the IP addresses

98
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,739
for every server we can find and we look

99
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,200
to see we look to see the answers that

100
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,120
come back to us if the answers come back

101
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,700
that are not satisfactory meaning that

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,080
the answer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not authoritah the answer</font>

103
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,488
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Authority but it's basically a</font>

104
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,650
negative answer which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the second</font>

105
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">category or in third categories an</font>

106
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,280
answer comes back with a another DNS

107
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,310
record saying look elsewhere for this

108
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">data we call we call that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lane we're</font>

109
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,359
going after<font color="#E5E5E5"> those ones first obviously</font>

110
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,560
that's not a complete test of lameness

111
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:07,109
but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not flagging right now is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

112
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we fail to get information if we</font>

113
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,840
don't get an IP address for the name

114
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,310
server we don't go after it because

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,709
there's so many sub cases there to

116
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,450
handle still if we don't get an<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

117
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,180
back from the server we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't go after</font>

118
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,009
that right now one reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that is</font>

119
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,000
it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work to be sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

120
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,770
you're right about a server doesn't

121
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,750
answer because the routing missions may

122
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,370
pop up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a daily thing maybe</font>

123
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,530
transient outages that are going through

124
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,360
the network also<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're doing</font>

125
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,309
a testing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we we have to do more</font>

126
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,440
tests and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> around to be sure that we</font>

127
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,000
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak about those also is easier</font>

128
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">to demonstrate to someone look your name</font>

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,930
so we gave us this data it's not the

130
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">right answer if we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

131
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,740
back it's hard to negotiate or to

132
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,710
explain us alone what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is or</font>

133
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,479
what this fix might be what we've done

134
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,190
so far is on this on the slide here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

135
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">have we did our initial test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back in</font>

136
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">February we send out notices according</font>

137
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,750
to the first step of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy which</font>

138
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:01,470
was email to the points<font color="#E5E5E5"> of contact of</font>

139
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:04,050
the network registration block we ran a

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,870
second test again<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see how we were</font>

141
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,979
doing in terms of reporting we did a

142
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,960
second notice because it seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

143
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,900
very helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it again being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

144
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,430

then we did another test<font color="#E5E5E5"> and its last</font>

146
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,780
test was to help us measure how much

147
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:23,820
work we had accomplished by this first

148

with the s number that we go after is

we did another test we ran just on

measurements by zone by zone initially

168
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,470
we test at or about 200,000 zones we had

169
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:12,480
in our database of that 55,000 we

170
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,420
flagged as having some lame answers come

171
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,700
back the tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did the end of</font>

the first phase of a few weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> about six</font>

weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> later I guess show that this</font>

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,990
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> had gone down to 36,000 zones so</font>

175
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,780
we feel that we had at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> some impact</font>

176
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,340
right away we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the second phase</font>

177
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,960
we tested again and we saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even a</font>

178
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,669
smaller number now down to twenty-eight

twenty-nine thousand zones being lame

180
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,300
and we just ran the<font color="#E5E5E5"> test again we</font>

181
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:41,849
noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this number is bounced back</font>

182
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:43,290
up back up to 35,000 just to reinforce

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,910
that we're talking about zones in the

servers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we tested initially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

being lame and that doesn't say that

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were good it just says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not come back with an answer saying</font>

193
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,130
that they were late that's a big

194
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,990
difference about twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent said</font>

195

that they were not authority of servers

196
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,580
they were probably running recursively

197
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,850
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we didn't step those as a</font>

198
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,500
as a well delegated zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> well five</font>

199
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,060
percent came back saying that there was

200
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,640
no information here about that zone that

201
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,670
son didn't exist and there was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

202
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,820
an initial<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had some other answer</font>

00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,870
has a cname that referred out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his own</font>

204
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,060
now there's a load when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this</font>

205
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,680
testing we have to we automate the test

206
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,910
in the engineering is automated this

207
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,500
test to go on test the servers when the

208
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,880
registrants<font color="#E5E5E5"> that our contact is saying</font>

209
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
we found a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">email to our registration services and</font>

212
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,550
this is a rough idea of how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

213
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,540
they were contacted in the period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

214
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:55,060
first couple of tests now when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when</font>

215
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,160
someone contacts our<font color="#CCCCCC"> helpdesk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what are</font>

216
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,770
our procedure is at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> point is to</font>

217
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,380
first communicate with the registrant

218
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,510
about the problem first we look at and

219
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,340
see what are we seeing is being wrong so

220
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,990
we can talk with them<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what the</font>

221
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,030
problem was I got there got our

222
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,500
attention about their name server we

223
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">explained to them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we expect to see</font>

224
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,919
what it what is a non lame deluge what's

225
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,990
a good delegation was it look like when

226
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,000
we do our test then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two things</font>

227
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can happen here one is it might be</font>

228
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,880
right to change the database<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

229
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,830
have so we walk people through the

230
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,030
process of changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> records in our</font>

231
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,280

232
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,159
registered from pre airing days in our

234
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,570
decide they want to fix the name server

235
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,338
to handle a delegation correctly and we

236
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,690
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through them as much as we can in</font>

237
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:38,890
helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> them fix their names are now</font>

238
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,510
name servers are different depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

239
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,360
what you're running so we can't offer

240
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,100
the exact recipe<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a correctly</font>

241
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,490
configured name server there's too much

242
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us to cover in that area some of the</font>

243
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,460
observations we've had to date about

244
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,770
this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are generally</font>

245
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,540
interested in getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> solved I've</font>

246
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,069
known<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in other registry is outside</font>

of the air in region outside of the

this problem solved two people want to

250
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,790
correct this problem they want to know

251
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,979
what's about we have a we have a web

252
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,810
page there which has a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

253
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,690
answer about some of our efforts and

254
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,680
some explanations we've also noticed

255
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,530
this is gonna be a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliberate</font>

256
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,489
process it's it's hard to handle it's

257
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,959
hard to clean up all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

258
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,089
in the database there's a lot of zones

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,890
out there a lot of way things may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font>

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,660
done correctly<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of ways of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contact</font>

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,410
continue the notification process we

to go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to be more</font>

answering for whatever not answering

identifying engineering issues with this

294
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,000

312
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,050
the moderator side what happens next

313
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,540
I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question actually and if</font>

314
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:12,270
anybody else has the question then

315
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:15,079
here are the other registries are they

316
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:18,120
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they doing this sort of thing yet</font>

317
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,360
they haven't taken steps to actually

318
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,080
identify lame delegations I don't

319
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,670
believe they've actually gone through

320
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,550
and done anything particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

321
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,140
most in the phase of identifying what is

322
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,329
lameness what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean from a</font>

323
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,250
protocol sense how much your problem do

324
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,940
they have we have it early agreed that

325
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,740
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to measure each of our</font>

326
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,510
delegations separately the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

327
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,770
delegations the AP dick delegations<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

328
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,180
ours we want to measure the level

329
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,569
lameness in all three of those lagna

330
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,579
call so because there are reasons why

331
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">they may be different quit that way in</font>

332
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,550
our in our region especially because we

333
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the old registrations we may have</font>

334
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,699
more of a lameness problem than they do

335
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:59,480
so we're actually going ahead and doing

336
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,480
things now anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>
