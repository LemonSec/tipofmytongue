1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,099
so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> panel that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,349
into here at ten o'clock is a discussion

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,420
about DNS SEC deployment in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root</font>

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,610
zone the moderator for the panel<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:23,220
Duane lessels from verisign and I'll let

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:27,869
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce the panelists great thanks</font>

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,210
a lot tom so we got we have four four

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,500
speakers up this morning first we're

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,920
gonna hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> from dave night from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,620
who will update us on the Rue DNS SEC

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,469
deployment plan and the status<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sort</font>

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">of where we are now next Keith will</font>

13
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:47,670
represent the NSO r kand is si and have

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,230
some things to say about<font color="#CCCCCC"> F</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roots plans</font>

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,629
and what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with bind then I'll</font>

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,059
be back up here to<font color="#CCCCCC"> present some some</font>

17
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,989
graphs and some some data that we've

18
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,269
collected during the initial rollout and

19
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:06,179
finally you'll hear from Suzanne again

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:12,510
with some some deep thoughts for the

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">future I guess right so I went to and I</font>

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,380
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encourage you while the</font>

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,700
presentations are being given if you

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,750
have a clarifying question or some some

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,750
kind of really short question feel free

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,850
to ask us during during that otherwise

27

for the for the more discussion e-type

28
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,699
questions will save those until the end

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,009
if that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's not good are you</font>

signed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that KSK</font>

73
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,440
the goal here is to sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> the root zone</font>

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,440
this should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a transplant process with</font>

75
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,779
audit procedures and it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much a</font>

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,849
desire that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate a delay and</font>

77
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,630
often to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in both</font>

78
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:14,859
directions we have anticipated issues

79
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:17,719
with signing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route first of those is</font>

80
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">there a significant portion of DNS</font>

81
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,710
resolvers out there which are using ed

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">and s0 and sent the juba by default</font>

83
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,039
which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're advertising</font>

84
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">they have desire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to receive large signed</font>

85
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,120
responses so when we sign the route we

86
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,639
will start sending those to those

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,919
clients some of those clients are going

88
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,450
to be behind things in the network which

89
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,729
caused them to be unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to receive</font>

90
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,510
those large responses so when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font>

91
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:46,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">is saying things might break for them</font>

92
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,050
another issue is that as we as soon as

93
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:49,490
we sign the route we expect people are

94
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,950
going to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

95
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,780
validate it while we're going through

96
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,580
the deployment phase we would rather

97
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,500
that didn't happen if we have problems

98
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to unsign the whatever</font>

99
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,490
reason we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want a community or</font>

100
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,910
validators to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> formed for whom this</font>

101
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:08,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to cause things to break so to</font>

102
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,760
this end we're doing a stage deployment

103
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,620
the goal is that we never<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into a</font>

104
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,289
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we have a client</font>

105
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:20,450
population that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to break if we</font>

106
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:23,450
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two unsign the roof further we want</font>

107
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:26,630
to deploy not on a flag day we want to

108
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,599
rule out the same group to individual

109
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:32,450
root cellars one at a time over a period

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,240
of several weeks and months so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

111
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:40,520
can gauge the impact of deploying it as

112
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:42,050
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go along so what we're doing is</font>

113
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,799
deploying something called the

114
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,720
deliberately unvalidated will root zone

115
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,360
this looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same group zone but</font>

116
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,160
it can't be used for validation so this

117
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,960
will prevent a community of<font color="#E5E5E5"> validators</font>

118
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,960
forming while we roll this out

119
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,870
what it means in practice is that the

120
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,409
root zone is signed exactly as it will

121
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:07,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">be but the keys used to sign it before</font>

122
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:10,240
publication are removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the zone</font>

123
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:13,180
and replaced with deliberately<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

124
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,840
obviously broken keys they look like

125
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,930
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as plain text explanation in there</font>

126
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,789
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not for use for validation</font>

127
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,939
so we hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that nobody is going to</font>

128
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:26,889
ignore that and try to do it anyway at

129
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:29,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of this deployment process when</font>

130
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:31,509
we actually go into full production the

131
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,639
zone will change so that the real keys

132
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:38,580
are included in the zone and this will

133
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:41,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away we're now into this deployment</font>

138
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:54,759
in February so far there have been no

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:22,270
we're going along measurement as a as a

we're doing full packet captures the DNS

151
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:44,409
work is is where the data is being sent

152
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:48,490
for aggregation and analysis or some

153
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:50,409
testing has gone on the doors itself is

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,560
a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology that we've introduced</font>

155
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:55,960
to the roof so prior to doing that we

156
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:01,479
did testing of the behavior of resolvers

157
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:04,680
with this deliberately broken zone that

158
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,680
find no problems

159
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:15,110
on that the iono side of this TLD

160
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,450
operators who have signed their TLD and

161

quick summary is it allows cryptographic

verification that the DNS records that

sent by the owner of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that zone and there</font>

260
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:44,459
seems to be building consensus that the

00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:45,868
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for DNS SEC has come the standards</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and implementations are now mature</font>

263
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:52,519
there's increasing abuse of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS for</font>

things that cache poisoning<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kaminski</font>

265
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,479
last year for example and many of the

process of signing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or gov a whole bunch</font>

268
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:05,489
of ccTLDs or either signed or in the

269
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:07,139
process of doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but DNS SEC is</font>

270
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:09,479
based on a hierarchy of trust anchors

271
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,339
the apex these of the root you don't

272
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:12,989
really have full validation unless you

273
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,479
can go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the way from the leaf</font>

274
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:17,129
domain that you're validating follow the

00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,479
trust anchor chain back up to the root

276
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:20,129
so assigning the route has been

277
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:22,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's been necessary for full</font>

deployment obviously there's been a lot

279
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:26,489
of layer 9 around that but the good news

280
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:30,209
is that icon is finally in a position to

281
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:32,309
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have this happen this year so</font>

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,569
we operate a fruit and because a

291
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:57,560
also views bind to serve the route as

<font color="#CCCCCC">well we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have more anycast nodes for</font>

effort than any of the other operators

294
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,690
so one of the issues that we face

295
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,060
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the other operators is</font>

someone of scale there are over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 of</font>

298
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:15,319
or two every few months use the map so

299
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,569
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want to do is</font>

300
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure that we have a stable version</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest stable version of bind is 962</font>

why would say is if there are issues now

333
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,879
it's best to do them ASAP because they

346
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,539
about the types of data gathering and

00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:20,909
effective analysis that have been done

348
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,770
but it's not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about capturing</font>

snapshots during the transitions it's

350
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:28,339
also about looking at the long-term

<font color="#E5E5E5">trends as the various service cut across</font>

that we will support for this doesn't

357
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,520
mean you others won't work but it's a

358
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,049
case of if there are any issues then we

359
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to be able to say this is the one</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will fix first by nine six two</font>

361
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,740
one important difference in this in

362
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,239
previous versions of binders that it

363
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,740
supports the shattered DNS site

364
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,370
algorithm which has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to sign</font>

365
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root not because the root servers</font>

366
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,360
themselves need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

367
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,309
validation using that algorithm but but

368
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,780
rather they just need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> serve it but</font>

369
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:12,389
like I said we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to have</font>

370
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,980
a line in the sand other operators are

371
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,740
using bind we would strongly encourage

372
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,830
them to start testing this version and

373
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:23,520
basically let us know if there any

374
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:24,960
particular issues I said 962 is the

375
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,370
latest stable version of mind of course

376
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,970
we've just released our latest latest

377
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:33,059
version of buying 970 we call this our

378
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,309
DNS SEC for<font color="#E5E5E5"> humans so although all the</font>

380
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:40,649
for a decade or so all kinds of dookie

381
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,310
stuff to make a sign group work most of

382
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:44,350
you network operators out there

383
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,330
I've probably find DNS SEC incredibly

384
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,820
painful and particularly end users as

385
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,260
well what we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done with 970 is we've</font>

386
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,669
basically put a hold of things and there

387
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make easier particularly when you're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about signing your own zones</font>

391
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:04,000
would strongly recommend that you have a

392
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,830
look at by 970 there has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue</font>

393
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,690
which has been found in all versions of

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,939
validating resolvers bind another one's

395
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,730
out there which causes some issues at

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the authoritative end if it is run under</font>

398
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,430
validating resolver and Suzanne I'll be

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,770
seeing a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

400
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,060
for validating resolvers we would

401
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,450
recommend hanging on a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks</font>

402
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:30,340
because there's a patch coming out which

403
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:34,990
will address that issue one other thing

404
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:38,260
that I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mention is my CS d lv</font>

405
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,570
we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up the dns a glucoside</font>

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:46,450
the route was signed if it goes away

408
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,190
people don't need lv anymore that's

409
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,690
great but d lv isn't just about

00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,770
strongly<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend having a look at</font>

432
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">blind 970 thank you</font>

433
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,650
back

434
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,460
ok so again my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Duane and I work</font>

435
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:44,360
for verisign I have a bunch of pictures

436
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:47,130
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you from from the data analysis</font>

437
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,449
I'm a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit nervous that the colors</font>

438
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,670
are not going to represent very well so

439
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,650
if if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're interested you may want to</font>

440
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,480
download the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDF from from the</font>

441
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,300

442
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:04,500
laptops in case this is hard too hard to

443
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:07,350
see so all these all this data comes

444
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,260
from the ders<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deliberately</font>

445
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:14,939
unvalidated below root zone this has

446
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:17,610
already been explained the schedule has

447
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,760
already been presented by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave as well</font>

448
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:24,300
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the data I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> el and</font>

449
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,710
and a and obviously going forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

450
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:31,710
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have much more data to analyze</font>

451
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:35,430
in the future there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two sets of data</font>

452
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:37,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we have the first is priming</font>

453
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,810
queries only which we have been

454
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:44,670
collecting continuously since about

455
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">December and so that's nice because it's</font>

456
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,230
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a low low volume stream that we</font>

457
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,240
can that we can manage and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then right</font>

458
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the time that each set of root</font>

459
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:58,530
servers flips over we do a like a full

460
00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:00,510
packet capture for 48 hours these for

461
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:04,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">these we capture the queries only to</font>

462
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,040
keep them to sort of a manageable size

463
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:14,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> l root just FYI down here</font>

464
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:19,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">i included the maintenance window times</font>

465
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:23,000
for for reference so this first graph

466
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:26,460
shows the the rate of priming queries

467
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,230
coming to<font color="#CCCCCC"> el</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root and the maintenance</font>

468
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,220
window started<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,800 on this day and</font>

469
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,830
so this this graph shows about a

470
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,180
four-hour window before and after two

471
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:40,290
hours before and after four hours total

472
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:42,650
and so no no change here which which was

473
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:46,649
sort of nice to see

474
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:48,320
for comparison<font color="#E5E5E5"> now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this graph</font>

475
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:51,330
overlays all the other root servers

476
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,120
priming query rates the red one at the

477
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:56,550
top is is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> roots and that one always</font>

478
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:00,840
tends to get more higher rate of queries

479
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:02,850
than the others ear ood has these funny

480
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,830
hourly spikes which I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really sure</font>

481
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:08,580
what those are it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be somebody</font>

482
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:10,350
monitoring something and there's there's

483
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,710
a couple down at the bottom which I

484
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,480
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> represents their actual</font>

485
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:18,270
query rates I think there's some missing

486
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:26,240
data here that makes them sort out at

487
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:31,860
the bottom this graph shows the average

488
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:34,710
reply size for priming responses and you

489
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,560
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly see when the when the when</font>

490
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,320
this server first started serving our

491
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">sigs the the average size</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> starts going</font>

492
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,070
up so it before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was something like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

493
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,040
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's 643 bytes and after all of</font>

494
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,600
their nodes have been switched over the

495
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:57,560
the mean size ends up being something

496
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,560
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven uh so 170 or so</font>

497
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:07,820
and then here's here's the data for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

498
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:10,419
the other root servers at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same the</font>

500
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:23,670
this is kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> related data this this</font>

501
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:27,650
is a histogram showing the categories of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the response response sizes so the red</font>

503
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:33,210
blocks here are responses that are 512

504
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,780
bytes or less and these are almost

505
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:40,049
certainly from clients that are not

and then afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> it jumps update</font>

510

511
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,870
little bit interesting later when i get

512
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:05,668
to a route to compare the differences

513
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:08,428
between between<font color="#E5E5E5"> LNA now this graph comes</font>

514
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:10,770
not from the priming card data set but

515
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:14,450
from the full packet data set and this

516
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:17,520
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> the full for a data 48 hours and</font>

517
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious change in TCP queries right</font>

518
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,910
around the signing time so it went from

519
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:27,090
almost nothing to about 25 per second

520
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:28,679
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty close to what we</font>

521
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,049
and others had been predicting what

522
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:37,020
happened you guys aren't surprised were

523
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:42,809
you Dave no for comparison here's the

524
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:45,000
other the other the roots data so it's

525
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,879
interesting again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have an</font>

526
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,640
explanation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but even though</font>

527
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,320
eller would happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be almost zero</font>

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:56,160
prior to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to switching over some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

530
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,640
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean II and a and E</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up there</font>

531
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,640
sort of high

532
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:15,960
this is the overall rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> of UDP queries</font>

533
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:18,450
coming into<font color="#E5E5E5"> l</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> routes so it shows some</font>

534
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,310
diurnal patterns but you know otherwise

535
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,610
no significant changes or anything to be

536
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:26,250
alarmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and then for comparison</font>

537
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,290
here's the others so it is interesting

538
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:32,610
that there's there's quite a spread in

539
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:44,810
in UDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> query rates between between all</font>

540
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:44,810
the routes this this picture shows

541
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:53,370
responses by four categories the

542
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:56,790
response code and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not the the</font>

545
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:12,360
domain responses where the deal bit was

00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:15,000
set blue is referrals with<font color="#E5E5E5"> vo and then</font>

547
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,030
down here is the same NX domains and

548
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,740
referrals without without DNS SEC

549
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:26,070
requested so again no no significant

550
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,700
changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this data after after</font>

552
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:39,600
this shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rate of queries for for</font>

553
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:42,030
certain DNS SEC query types so the

557
00:28:48,900 --> 00:29:00,360
the query type was DS and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red shows</font>

00:28:53,570 --> 00:29:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS key queries and the the y-axis here</font>

red would be dwarfed by the scale

563
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:19,120
okay this this graph I like I like quite

564
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:23,769
a bit but it may require a little bit of

565
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,570
explanation here there are 11 different

566

colors and 11 different categories<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:51,870
down increasing by powers of two until

574
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:55,169
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom its clients that send a</font>

575
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:58,779
thousand or more queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> per second and</font>

576
00:29:55,169 --> 00:30:00,460
then the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> log scaled axis shows you</font>

577
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:08,769
know how many clients are in that in

578
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:10,539
that category so it when we were

579
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:11,590
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about potential problems you</font>

580
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:14,259
know we're worried that there would be

581
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,639
some clients that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped getting</font>

582
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:18,610
responses and they would be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

583
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:20,889
panicky and if if that were the case we

584
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:23,590
would expect I think to see some some

585
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:26,590
increases down here in the in the lower

586
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:29,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">range after signing we would expect to</font>

587
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,330
see some clients increasing their query

588
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,100
rates in order to give an answer however

589
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,689
in fact you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably switched</font>

590
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,000
to a different route server and got

591
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,590
their answer there so it's it's a little

592
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,639
bit early to be you know drawing too

593
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,639
many conclusions from this picture

594
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so now I get to do the same grass</font>

595
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:57,669
all over again for for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> root this is</font>

596
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:59,620
the the priming query rate for when the

597
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,410
day that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a root switched over the</font>

00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:04,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when it officially opens at</font>

599
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:09,100
1700 UTC but we didn't see the first

600
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:11,170
signed response until 1806 so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

601
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,570
some delay<font color="#E5E5E5"> in getting that started I</font>

602
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,100
guess and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> shortly after that</font>

603
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:20,080
there's this little there's this little

604
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:22,149
dip which I don't I don't really know

605
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,290
exactly what caused that you know but it

606
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,780
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recover it probably this</font>

607
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,399
probably lasted about five minutes maybe

608
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">some little routing glitch or something</font>

609
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,560
caused a decrease in traffic there

610
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:44,170
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same with overlaying with the</font>

611
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:47,490
other route traces this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows the</font>

612
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:51,070
the average reply size for a root

613
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:54,490
whereas 44 l wrote the the size went up

614
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:58,179
sort of it angled up until<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got above</font>

615
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:00,310
750 for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> roots it didn't go up that</font>

616
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:05,770
much more the increase was not as

617
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:07,929
dramatic and here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see again l</font>

618
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:10,870
root is way up there at the top the

619
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,520
purple line so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the</font>

620
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,129
histogram for for a rude and you can see

621
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:18,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> significant set of</font>

622
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:22,600
clients sending prime inquiries to a

623
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:24,399
witch black<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed NS apparently and then so</font>

624
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,770
they fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that 512 category and</font>

625
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:32,410
obviously those didn't change upon

626
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:34,600
signing so you know it does seem that

627
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,340
that a root is in some ways special by

628
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,110
being listed first it receives more of

629
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,179
these kinds of queries from from clients

630
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:42,310
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so I'm kind of glad that</font>

631
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">it got signs earlier in the deployment</font>

632
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:47,860
rather than later so that you know we

633
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:49,480
can we can watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and convince</font>

634
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:52,679
ourselves that even though it's special

635
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing too terrible is going to happen</font>

636
00:32:54,090 --> 00:33:01,529
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> career 84</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a route</font>

637
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:04,980
and you can see the the big spike there

638
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:07,289
when when signing happens when the doors

639
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:11,520
happened but another interesting thing

640
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:14,850
is if you remember two weeks prior when

641
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:21,590
when Elbert was signs<font color="#E5E5E5"> a's tcp right was</font>

642
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 per second and see if I can go back</font>

643
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">now at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of its deployment</font>

644
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:28,590
it'sit's jumped up to like 40 per second

645
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:31,649
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any data in</font>

646
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:35,490
between these two times to analyze

647
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:37,080
unfortunately so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not sure if you</font>

648
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:40,140
know i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if a great one up</font>

649
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,820
because l root switched over first or if

650
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,179
there's some other something else going

651
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,178
on there

652
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,530
this is the overall UDP career<font color="#CCCCCC"> 84 a</font>

653
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">route and the only thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks a</font>

654
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:04,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit strange is over here on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

655
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:06,890
right side there's this spike but as

656
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,859
these other graphs show this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

657
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">just due to a single client that went a</font>

658
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:14,060
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy and you can see that it</font>

659
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,609
happened on all of the root server

660
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:24,529
instances not just a they all got hit

661
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:26,810
with this load this graph looks very so

662
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:33,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">much the 14 l this is the query types</font>

663
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:35,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns secretary types here's the the</font>

664
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:39,649
client query rate graph and again down

665
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:44,810
here at the the right at the bottom you

666
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:45,918
can see this little this<font color="#CCCCCC"> little block</font>

667
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,599
right here that represents this one

668
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,339
client that that all of a sudden got

669
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,740
panicky and started hitting all the root

670
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:57,380
servers with a thousand cores per second

671
00:34:51,739 --> 00:35:02,000
or more and then kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just for fun</font>

672
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:04,250
this list last graph shows the same data

673
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,690
for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the roots or all of the root</font>

674
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:09,859
servers during that period and you can

675
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,730
see they all have this if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

676
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,750
the purple line at the bottom you can

677
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,300
say they all have the same pattern

678
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:17,859
there's this one kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a u-shaped</font>

679
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,859
graph this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one spike at the end</font>

here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we're stuck with each</font>

697
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,890
the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this panel so I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

698
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,230
part of why it felt to me to sort of try

699
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,940
to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an overview now</font>

700
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:38,940
I'm stract out a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

701
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,079
we've been talking about here even

702
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,300
though you know I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure we</font>

703
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,650
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do that even though in some ways</font>

704
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,599
I'm the worst possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> person to do it</font>

705
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I've been working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deana sex</font>

706
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:54,180
since 2002 and been trying to encourage

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route signing activity for almost as</font>

708
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:01,410
long so arguably I lack perspective but

709
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:03,869
but here's what i got this materials

710
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:06,118
been interesting to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns geeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm as</font>

711
00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:07,670
happy with with data point as anybody

712
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,470
and this is an interesting engineering

713
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:12,359
exercise you know bolting something like

714
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:15,868

we talked a little bit already about

possible side effects this one has been

728
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,740
around for a while Dave touched on it

729
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,300
briefly responses from root servers for

learning curve of of how to distinguish

between things that Deanna stuck was

797
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:11,760
designed to flag for you attacks and

798
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:13,919
malicious compromises and the fact that

799
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,329
things break and people screw up and

800
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,510
mistakes get made and this

801
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:19,859
configurations happen so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,480
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the curve of developing</font>

806
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,000

<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font>

831
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:38,400
for instance bind will be is you will be

00:42:35,939 --> 00:42:40,529
making a patch available for nine dots

74 by nine dot seven and four other

supported versions of bind in a few

835
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:49,859
weeks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be a lot less aggressive</font>

in this particular scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

balance between being aggressive about

00:42:55,469 --> 00:43:01,140
responding to attacks and being scalable

840
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:04,759
as far as what the network

infrastructure really expects or needs

842
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:09,479
so yeah those are just a couple of

843
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:14,459
examples we will be discovering more

no cost but there's we just need to

balance costs and benefits so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that the bottom line it's important to</font>

863
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,390
know many networks dns is not a focus

864
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:06,269
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to provide basic</font>

865
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:10,379

people have to talk to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS people</font>

00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:45,709
which will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a novelty for</font>

some people we know and love

there's a set of interactions that's

882
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:58,109
you're in a shop where DNS just works

883
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:59,969
it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better if there are</font>

really doing understand how it may have

feels unloved thanks

890
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:28,240
okay how much time do we have for

891
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:30,339
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so I</font>

892
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,689
need 12 people to come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ask a</font>

893
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:37,319
question that can be answered in one

00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:37,319
minute each anyone anyone

895
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:49,620
so doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually have a question for</font>

896
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:50,700
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your data can</font>

897
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go back where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were looking at</font>

898
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:57,540
the response sizes<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the ders was</font>

899
00:45:54,450 --> 00:46:03,480
deployed it seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the response</font>

900
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:09,029
size for<font color="#E5E5E5"> L was much larger than that</font>

901
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:14,060
coming back from a and so it's a remote

902
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:14,060
question from Lisa<font color="#CCCCCC"> hagaman at Dinah okay</font>

903
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,560
assume it's referring to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data right</font>

904
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:26,310
so that one versus the priming query

905
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:30,570
size from a right so this graph shows

906
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:31,380
the average reply size and any right

907
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,740
there is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a noticeable</font>

908
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:38,310
difference and the difference seems to

909
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:44,100
be because<font color="#CCCCCC"> L root for whatever reason is</font>

910
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:47,910
a very small set of queries without<font color="#CCCCCC"> ed</font>

911
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:52,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">NS this this red down here is is much</font>

912
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,759
smaller than it is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

913
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:05,900
so now i don't i don't know why yeah so

914
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:07,910
that is there a specific reason that you

915
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:11,569
can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of why a would receive a</font>

916
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:16,730
higher quality of queries that naively<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

917
00:47:11,569 --> 00:47:18,019
would i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are resolve</font>

918
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,999
our implementations out there that are

919
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:21,200
not very sophisticated they pick the

920
00:47:19,999 --> 00:47:25,609
first one in the list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

921
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,749
support ed NS<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it but you</font>

922
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:29,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">know i don't i don't have any other data</font>

923
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:31,609
to back that up at this point and i

924
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:33,559
don't know where those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

925
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:36,950
if they're on cable modems or if they're

926
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:39,109
in phones or I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

927
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:41,419
speculate also that because L group I

928
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:45,019
think alder is the most recently re

929
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:46,609
numbered root server we're not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

930
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:49,069
root hints on a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the older</font>

931
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:53,288
deployed resolvers and that's possibly

932
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:53,288
why we see less yeah that's a good point

933
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:59,450
yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do have this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did generate</font>

934
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:03,319
this I think I did generate these four

935
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:04,730
other the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other nodes so I could look at</font>

936
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:06,529
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just didn't include those in the</font>

937
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:11,180
slide set so like we can answer that

938
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:13,519
that way to Kevin Kevin over<font color="#E5E5E5"> root for me</font>

939
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:15,649
yes net I must have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been i vaguely</font>

940
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:18,950
curious about that interesting glitch

941
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:22,880
downward in traffic on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a server</font>

942
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:24,859
after it's cut over and the query<font color="#CCCCCC"> size</font>

943
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">bounce up they look like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they occurred</font>

944
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:28,999
simultaneously and when I see it

945
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:31,640
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and novel ease of the data</font>

946
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:33,439
like that i always wondering is there

947
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,470
something something bigger going on here

948
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,599
that I'm just not realizing do they

949
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:41,029
actually occur simultaneously the jump

950
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:43,160
up in size that goes away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the drop</font>

951
00:48:41,029 --> 00:48:45,980
down in queries per second that goes

952
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:49,098
away are those can you confirm<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether</font>

953
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:50,480
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time or not looking</font>

954
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:53,779
at them visually yeah that seems to be

955
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,329
the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> so something was going on there</font>

956
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:59,539
with some software someplace out there

957
00:48:56,329 --> 00:49:02,839
doing queries that seems to adapt itself

958
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:06,079
out after about 10 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so very</font>

959
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:07,529
strange probably not significant but it

960
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,900
bothers me

961
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:11,980
right and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think so another other</font>

962
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:17,110
thing that people have pointed out is

963
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:18,430
it's it's probably related well it

964
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,080
should have been in this should have

965
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,640
been in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> our bucket but but this</font>

966
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,860
little hump here is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little strange to</font>

967
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:30,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it kind of bumps up and then and</font>

968
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:32,410
then kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of comes back down I agree</font>

969
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:35,410
it's interesting i don't i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

970
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:38,920
the explanation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be scratching my head</font>

971
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:40,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">over that for a while did the fact that</font>

972
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,280
the number of queries drops and the size

973
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:44,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the queries goes up simultaneously</font>

974
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:47,050
when they're in reverse direction like

975
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:51,550
that makes me think that some software

976
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:54,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">someplace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically doing a lot of</font>

977
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:57,220
internal wheel spinning and not issuing

978
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:59,110
queries for a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a large</font>

979
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,689
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> root queries are basically</font>

980
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:03,370
garbage queries from a variety of stuff

981
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:04,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i suspect these probably fall in</font>

982
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,880
that category but this is all idle

983
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:08,529
speculation based on way too little<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

984
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,120
so i think i'll shut up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

985
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:15,640
but another point i want to make is that

986
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:19,060
we see things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this sort of all the</font>

987
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:22,660
time at the at the root<font color="#E5E5E5"> roots looking at</font>

988
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:24,850
this data it only takes a few sort of

989
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:29,230
misbehaving clients to cause anomalies

990
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:30,730
like this you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> counting per</font>

991
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:33,250
query so if you have one client that

992
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:37,330
sort of goes nuts and starts hitting you

993
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:38,800
with all you know ed<font color="#CCCCCC"> ns0 queries or not</font>

994
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,660
eating<font color="#CCCCCC"> ass Iroquois it can cause a</font>

995
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">little a little blip like this and and</font>

996
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,250
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that in the data we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

997
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:49,210
before you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we were doing der stuff</font>
