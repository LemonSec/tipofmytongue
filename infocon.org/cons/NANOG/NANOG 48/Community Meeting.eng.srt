between the net I portion the air and

portion more relevant to both

83
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,640
constituencies so that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,650
us so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're not stuck in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

101
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,070
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> over used to be years ago</font>

102
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,160
where

103
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:23,360
it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> March than we didn't know where</font>

104
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,250
we're going to be in June and finally

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,810
the steering committee has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

106
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,460
about setting up a finance subcommittee

107
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,650
for a while so we could pay more

108
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,560
attention to where the money comes from

109
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,760
and where it goes and we intend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

110
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">started on that in the next couple of</font>

111
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:43,039
months here's a list of mailing list to

112
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,140
give us as a side I stole from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe you</font>

113
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,380
can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it committed to memory this is</font>

114
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,729
who you mail if you need anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

115
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,640
these slides will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the web so you</font>

116
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,950
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to memorize it Dave</font>

117
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,719
Meyer will now give us<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brief report on</font>

118
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:02,840
the program committee to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dominion yeah</font>

119
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,820
okay so unlike the steering committee

120
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:09,289
the program committee is really

121
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,630
fundamentally concerned with producing

122
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:14,840
the agenda and the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

123
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:17,870
current meeting so we don't have oh

124
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,750
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a real administrative aspect</font>

125
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,520
to it so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a lot with respect</font>

126
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,860
to that there's a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

127
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,830
we did do though that might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

128
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,190
interest one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um we had was</font>

129
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,599
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people had not complained but had</font>

130
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,670
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the call for</font>

131
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,230
presentations was never issued early

132
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:41,570
enough and it turns out that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFP is</font>

133
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:44,030
largely the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same every time with the</font>

134
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,849
exception of the dates so what we're

135
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,700
going to try to do is publish the dates

136
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:54,380
on the last day of this meeting so that

137
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:56,330
and let<font color="#E5E5E5"> people know that nanog 49 will</font>

138
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,440
be open for submissions<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's one</font>

172
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:44,459
whatever we're receptive to that I think

173
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,589
the biggest thing that we've decided to

174
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:50,129
do since the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog is we're</font>

191
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pretty much say this every time</font>

192
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:46,060
the mailing list is what you make it

193
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,500
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you contribute to it if</font>

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what everybody has email</font>

196
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,730
clients that can filter stuff you can

197
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,060
filter people you can filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> subjects</font>

198
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,890
you can do the filtering yourself so

199
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,410
we've really we've really really toned

200
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:05,199
down moderation that we've been doing in

201
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,760
fact there has been zero thread

202
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,850
moderations in February and there was

203
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">only one in January and that was because</font>

204
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,470
the thread was deviating into some

205
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,859
personal attacks and nobody likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

206
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:22,959
and was that's uh that's it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

207
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:25,959
Chris with the oh I'm sorry have you

208
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,869
ever considered some additions to

209
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">mailing list that would support some</font>

210
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,420
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of all heads up type</font>

211
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:37,390
messages that there is a major<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue in</font>

212
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:41,769
the network screwing up that we could

213
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:43,390
alert the community at<font color="#CCCCCC"> large to in a</font>

214
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:46,720
standard way that all everyone knows

215
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:50,380
that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an allocated heads up type</font>

216
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,870
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> message oh we've discussed in the</font>

217
00:09:50,380 --> 00:10:01,560
past splitting off the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists</font>

218
00:09:52,870 --> 00:10:01,560
into different categories of messages

219
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:07,149
the volume right now on the list i think

220
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,709
is low enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when there's</font>

221
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,870
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> major that's happening it</font>

222
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:13,599
really does stick out and I you will

223
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,120
notice it certainly something we can

224
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,360
discuss the only ones that we've really

225
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,589
split off are ones where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

226
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,420
know nobody really wants to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

227
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,459
the great places to eat in Austin if

228
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,569
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually in Austin so we</font>

229
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:30,329
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attendee list for them I think</font>

230
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,720
maybe that's what Patrick was going to

231
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,719
point out no

232
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:43,089

activity at Merritt I<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually start off</font>

264
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:09,829
with a number of slides about 48 but

265
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,589
this evening I thought I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

266
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:14,959
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 47 behind us and start with</font>

267
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:18,320
the financial report it's here as you

268
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">see it we had two hundred and seventy</font>

269
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,550
nine thousand three hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty</font>

270
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:27,050
seven dollars and 46 cents in revenue

271
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:29,719
revenue means it's both the registration

272
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,779
fees and sponsorship fees for the

273
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,589
meeting that's revenue and the expenses

274
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:40,160
were 268 7 30 to 39 with the various

275
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:42,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">categories following the expense the end</font>

276
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,709
of the day when we tallied up all of the

277
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:48,890
expenses against the revenue the meeting

278
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:51,890
itself nanog 47 netted the project

279
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:56,779
account an additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance of ten</font>

280
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:58,760
thousand six 1497 so that is consistent

281
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:00,709
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting before we haven't had a</font>

282
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:07,069

<font color="#E5E5E5">and we certainly appreciate</font>

300
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,220
certainly makes a difference when we're

contributors aren't always folks who

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:36,130
have provided monetary support but

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,989
in-kind support some activity or support

00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:19,390
I think it will prove<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be something</font>

evolution depending on your point of

view I like evolution I've really found

394

great reward and working through the

by the last election I can say it does

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:42,129
to continue to be engaged where it needs

404
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:45,250
to be engaged to make sure that the

yes I remember seeing and the old

479
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:39,730
version of nanog website a very good

480
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:42,809
collection of nano presentation I think

481
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:47,140
it was named na nóg network security

482
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:49,360
curriculum or a operations basic

<font color="#CCCCCC">curriculums I mean basically good set of</font>

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,860
neural presentations that contained a

486
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:59,080
this was I think it was lost somewhere

487
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:02,470
there when when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laid out a new</font>

489
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,400
searching for that and I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

490
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,830
do you know if this collection is

491
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,710
somewhere and maybe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an idea for</font>

492
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:14,020

presentations didn't fit into the proper

502
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:42,939
archive I had really believed that we

503
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,800
had made a link to those but I'll take a

504
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,200
look at them you're absolutely right we

505
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,389
need to maintain that archive and its

506

importance to the community in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

look at it I I know what problem you

509
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,168
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be referring to I'm just not sure</font>

raising fees I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you give us</font>

585
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,250
provide the t account where we can

586
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,590
actually get into things like

587
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,630
depreciation and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the balance</font>

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a more intelligent discussion I</font>

591
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,340
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done enough work</font>

592
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,639
on the sponsorship side and I think we

593
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,740
should do more work there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font>

594
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,360
do more work to you know improve the

595
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,790
income side of the balance sheet before

596
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,060
we decide to raise fees for people like

597
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:51,480
me and people like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks that's</font>

598
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,770
right I have a this Patrick no more I

599
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,080
have a follow-on question of what Betty

600
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:59,760
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> by raise of hands how many people</font>

601
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:02,699
here expense the nanog admitted entrance

602
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,680
fee let me rephrase my raise of hands

603
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:09,630
who here does not expense the na nóg

604
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:11,700
fee<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok of the people who because that</font>

605
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,280
was you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like six of you other</font>

606
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,810
people who do expense it how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

607
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,530
would have trouble getting your company

608
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:20,310
to expense an extra hundred bucks I

609
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:25,310
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually answered the</font>

610
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:28,020
question all right I can Betty nice job

611
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:30,210
you've done wonderfully I just want to

612
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">say a couple things first two are you by</font>

613
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:36,420
the way I do me hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

614
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,699
if you look at other similar conferences

615
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:42,000
to nano that lasts about the same amount

616
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:45,360
of time and have similar contents and

617
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,970
similar benefits nanog is a bit cheaper

618
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,379
than most this the most significant

619
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,240
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between a dog and some of</font>

620
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,190
these other conferences is the most of

621
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,180
these other conferences include at least

622
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:59,310
lunch so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what you may want to do</font>

623
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,140
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an intern hanging around is</font>

624
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:03,210
looking for something to do is actually

625
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,460
to do a little analysis and to look at

626
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,980
four or<font color="#E5E5E5"> five or six other similar</font>

627
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,200
conferences a similar length and figure

628
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,860
out sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at and do an</font>

629
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,900
apples-to-apples

630
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">person of your meals included that sort</font>

631
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:19,210
of thing so that's one item the other is

632
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:22,090
I do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to agree with Marty that if</font>

633
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:25,059
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the revenue that comes out</font>

634
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,980
of nanog and look at the percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

635
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:29,410
comes from sponsors and / essentially

636
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:32,410
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from attendees at most other</font>

637
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,840
similar conferences sponsors end up

638
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:37,600
paying considerably more a considerably

639
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,280
larger piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pie so while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

640
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">in any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way opposed to raising the price</font>

641
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:45,370
of the conference this is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal I</font>

642
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:49,809
think sponsors if marketed properly

643
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:51,428
presented properly and and if sponsors

644
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:53,290
are provided a way to monetize their

645
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:55,900
investment which in the past they have

646
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">not always been I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could you</font>

647
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">could really find more sponsors and</font>

648
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,200
charge them more I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot</font>

649
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:05,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">of stuff like having a permanent exhibit</font>

650
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,410
room open for the entire event having

651
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,689
you know levels of sponsorship putting

652
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,610
some logos some creative places I think

653
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:17,200
you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that without turning this</font>

654
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:21,189
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop you know and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

655
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:25,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely agree let me be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear i asked</font>

656
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:28,929
the question that to invoke a bit of

657
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,820
tension but to invoke dialogue as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve</font>

658
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:33,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">had indicated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a slide I think it's</font>

659
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:35,049
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important for the steering</font>

660
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:38,410
committee to have that kind of budgetary

661
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:40,299
exchange of information with merit it's

662
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:43,780
pretty hard for<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone like me or</font>

663
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:46,090
anyone else<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of have a deep level</font>

664
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,590
financial discussion if the community

665
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,659
meeting takes a long time you don't

666
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,309
usually do all of that here but it's

667
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,669
certainly something that I think is

668
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:56,830
worthwhile and the the engaged

669
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:59,500
discussion and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> balance of the</font>

670
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,870
registration fee vs the sponsorship fee

671
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,650
and a better understanding before you

672
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,750
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about an increase in in anything</font>

673
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,980
just a quick follow-up to that one thing

674
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,720
you should take away from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in</font>

675
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">years past when there have been</font>

676
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,799
discussions of raising the rates there

677
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,419
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> howls of protest I don't think</font>

678
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,270
you're getting quite as<font color="#E5E5E5"> many howls today</font>

679
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:21,250
that being said reasonably considering

680
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,540
the number of attendees you guys should

681
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,610
probably

682
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:28,090
you know have a margin of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty or</font>

683
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:29,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety thousand dollars per event you</font>

684
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,300
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in terms of I've run a couple</font>

685
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:34,960
of similar events you should be able to

686
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,610
clear a pretty good margin on this and I

687
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,900
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do that through booths in</font>

688
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:40,770
hand sponsorships and through of

689
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,550
necessary you know raising the rates

690
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:46,240
it's always been an interesting

691
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:49,120
trade-off between inviting sponsorships

692
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:53,140
and trying to not turn this into a trade

693
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,580
show and we certainly in the old days it

694
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:58,320
was very hard to what both side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of not</font>

695
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:00,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">making it a trade show in recent years</font>

696
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,820
we've definitely opened up the

697
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,830
sponsorship opportunities slowly my

698
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:08,620
personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion is that so far it's not</font>

699
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:10,210
at all intrusive I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear if</font>

700
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,080
anybody feels differently<font color="#CCCCCC"> and why</font>

701
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,130
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go maybe we</font>

702
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,379
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> ratchet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up a little bit more</font>

703
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">without hurting things the trick is</font>

704
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:23,800
going to be knowing when we've reached

705
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:26,970
the limit so next hi my name is joel

706
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:31,030
crouse k this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a personal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> observation</font>

707
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:32,980
ever since the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dominican Republic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font>

708
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:34,960
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to that one but that sort of had</font>

709
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,700
a first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the market was hugely</font>

710
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,740
down right then I could not convince my

711
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,590
bosses that that was a reasonable trip

712
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,030
for me to take and thus nanog for a

713
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,740
brief period has had this oh it's a

714
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:46,480
junket sort of scenario with my boss

715
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,600
they've gotten past that this is an

716
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,860
easier trip for me to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I'm</font>

717
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,740
not going to say we shouldn't go to fun

718
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,120
places but that that was just as an

719
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,870
observation that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really negative</font>

720
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,899
on my management's perception of what

721
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:04,149
Nana was the photos of everybody having

722
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,100
fun on the beach also didn't help but um

723
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,300
anyway I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know here nor</font>

724
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,750
there what to say but it was a

725
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">perception in my my company yeah that</font>

726
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,080
certainly was a pub- not the only person

727
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard that from even though that</font>

728
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:20,860
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really much resorted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vibart we</font>

729
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:22,900
were in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was unique in exotic Brandon</font>

730
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ross is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I accom on the other hand of</font>

731
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,889
that same argument I want to point out

732
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,419
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nano going to Dominican Republic</font>

733
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,370
actually opened up now now to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

734
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:32,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Dominican</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Republic</font>

735
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,759
that and I understand your issue that

736
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,710
never would have been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to an</font>

737
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">analog otherwise because coming from a</font>

738
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,800
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who does has a network there and</font>

739
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,980
other places around the Caribbean

740
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,520
hopefully soon places like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe</font>

741
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,540
Mexico or other other places that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

742
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,239
where the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> living is a lot lower</font>

743
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:51,520
the local North Americans who are part

744
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:54,219
of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> group who can't quite afford to</font>

745
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,139
travel to Miami or Austin or somewhere

746
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:59,890
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> they may be all attend when they</font>

747
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:01,420
can't so I think that balance of the one

748
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:05,440
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two times that we've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

749
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:07,810
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is not so bad really and</font>

750
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,050
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the counter-argument to going</font>

751
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:13,870
places like that we did reach the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

752
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:15,750
more potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> reached a new audience</font>

753
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:18,339
that we hadn't met<font color="#E5E5E5"> before and we also</font>

754
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,600
got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a piece of the network a</font>

755
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,980
piece of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world that we hadn't seen</font>

756
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,230
before so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

757
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,180
benefit to it so that opens up the

758
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,580
question of where should we be going i

759
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:30,419
know this is under survey frequently is

760
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,680
our usual rotation of cities good enough

761
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,330
should we actually try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to narrow it down</font>

762
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,160
so we go to the same set of three cities

763
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:38,819
or six cities over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> or do we</font>

764
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,649
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go more interesting places like</font>

765
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:44,380
more meetings in<font color="#E5E5E5"> canada for example or</font>

766
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,460
maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> alaska someday or probably</font>

767
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:49,000
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hawaii i don't think i could sell</font>

768
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:57,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but not quite canada but how about</font>

769
00:35:49,000 --> 00:36:01,210
cambridge<font color="#CCCCCC"> Akamai Todd and I think</font>

770
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:03,279
truthfully that all of us me various

771
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,770
committees and merit and probably among

772
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,650
the community members yourselves

773
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:10,120
struggle with the issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the</font>

774
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,420
target audience what is the population

775
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,339
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to serve with nanog</font>

776
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,780
for the last few meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

777
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:20,410
like two years I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if it's</font>

778
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:22,600
deeper than that one-third approximately

779
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:25,270
of our attendee basis here for the first

780
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">time how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those folks who attend</font>

781
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,740
for the first time come to subsequent

782
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:32,430
meetings probably some good data

783
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:36,160
analysis of understanding that trend and

784
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:37,839
also asking ourselves of the folks who

785
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,089
attend<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog do they make it to all</font>

786
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,609
three or do they just make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to two of</font>

787
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three I think</font>

788
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:47,140
a better understanding of of your

789
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,539
trending data and your target population

790
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:56,950
and how you want the community to grow

791
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:59,319
is in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your next chapter this</font>

792
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:01,390
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carl rocio certified Lara Finland</font>

793
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:04,869
this is totally unrelated to this

00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:09,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">discreet discussion actually a new area</font>

795
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:11,680
of questioning does none other as a

00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:15,190
group have any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of outreach program</font>

797
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:20,589
for I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say developing metro areas</font>

798
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:23,109
like Africa African the whole continent

799
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:27,489
of Africa has caught a substantial

800
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:31,029
increase in there and fiber connectivity

801
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:34,599
during last year or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and there is a</font>

802
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:36,789
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say whole whole group of</font>

804
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:44,079
there i'm a bit concerned or from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

805
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:48,430
network security viewpoint being being

yourself myself a security person there

807
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:56,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a potential for that area to be a</font>

808
00:37:52,589 --> 00:38:00,808
partner bill a lot of a dark area for us

809
00:37:56,499 --> 00:38:05,009
in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there could be a and a a</font>

810
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:08,380
lord say that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> p is developing there</font>

811
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:10,930
but also i mean just just to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

812
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,239
give out on the knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> base that the</font>

give give give that forward there this

815
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,788
is a me totally a separate program could

816
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:23,710
be but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but not totally i'm ready to</font>

817
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:26,559
know about this come this community has

818
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:29,769
a not acknowledge that some some parts

819
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:32,890
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world don't have and it's it's</font>

820
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:34,899
free and it's AI mean the all

821
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:38,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">presentations are out there publicly</font>

822
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:40,599
available but maybe giving so making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

823
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:42,640
some volunteer group of people going

824
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,589
going out giving lectures and things

825
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,720
would be a good idea well there are

826
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:49,538
definitely a number of operator groups

827
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,999
around the world clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we</font>

828
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:53,980
would all agree that nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

829
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:55,230
operators here and the attendee base is

830
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,290
probably

831
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:01,090
the deepest of the general attendance

832
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,950
and the other operators group<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe one</font>

833
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,600
of the things Steve on the steering

00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,700
committee<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Dave on the program</font>

835
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,220
committee you might want to consider is

836
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,439
how you might our outreach to some of

837
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,480
those other<font color="#E5E5E5"> operator groups and in build</font>

838
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,300
some of that global networking that was

839
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,130
just spoken about nano<font color="#CCCCCC"> gerson</font>

840
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,020
organization hasn't really focused on

841
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:22,120
that for it's certainly an interesting

842
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,120
thought there has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some discussion</font>

843
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:28,750
of perhaps coming up with a funding

844
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:32,770
model to send some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the experts in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

845
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:36,150
community to the meetings<font color="#CCCCCC"> f9 for example</font>

846
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:38,259
overseas for more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information exchange</font>

847
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,120
perhaps it might be more effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

848
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:43,180
what we've been doing which is inviting

849
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,370
one or two of them to come to us that's

850
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,379
something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to talk about there</font>

851
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:52,870
are certainly organizations in the u.s.

852
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:55,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this sort of outreach much more</font>

853
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:57,580
formal basis they're people I know who

854
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:00,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">divide a lot of time and energy into</font>

855
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:03,790
helping developing nations building

856
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:05,260
network infrastructures but that tends

857
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:07,270
to happen through organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

858
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,580
nanog that's certainly something worth

859
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:13,509
thinking about and worrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

860
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:16,770
future and if anybody wants to tossing

861
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:19,060
ideas or even help with this or maybe

862
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:23,020
tossing some funds<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this is kind</font>

863
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:26,470
of thing we could do okay TJ knifed in

864
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,180
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nokia so on that last comment</font>

865
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:31,060
having a team member who's actually

866
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:34,569
currently in Europe teaching African

867
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,950
network operators I would say I could

868
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,660
probably throw someone your way who

869
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:41,830
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some suggestions on that when</font>

870
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:43,620
he gets back so I had comments on a few

871
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:49,360
of the areas that you had talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

872
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:53,589
in terms of pricing for conference

873
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:56,140
attendance ship and locations coming

874
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:58,300
from a large company I can say there's

875
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,759
some amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flexibility in terms of</font>

876
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:03,460
conference attendance fees as long as

877
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're let's say in line with similar</font>

878
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,110
types of conferences like we talked

879
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,109
about

880
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:12,910
personally in my company having travel

881
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:16,420
that's domestic may puts it in sort of a

882
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:19,299
different class of approvals needed and

883
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:22,150
so it becomes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easier not</font>

884
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:24,550
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exotic locations also helps as</font>

885
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:27,460
was discussed and so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font>

886
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:32,290
had a trip booked to the dr effort for

887
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:35,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and didn't happen so yeah I would</font>

888
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:37,509
say yeah being able to generate some

889
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:38,950
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of revenue and having the</font>

890
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,920
additional sponsorship seems like it

891
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,149
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> beneficial to nanog but I think</font>

892
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,849
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a very good point that you made</font>

893
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,589
about not having it turned into some

894
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:49,720
sort of trade show and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

895
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:52,359
there's a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance in terms of</font>

896
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,569
things being sponsored now but also not

897
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:57,339
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> overly commercial or having the</font>

898
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,869
appearance of bias and the technical

899
00:41:57,339 --> 00:42:00,849
information so that so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

900
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:03,030
balance is very good right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

901
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:06,640
probably have wiggle room on either side

902
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:10,500
but good to be sort of watching over

903
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

904
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:18,540
hey guys hey you're not cuz I'll joke

905
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:22,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you we do you were coming you did um</font>

906
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:25,540
my name is Bill Norton and I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

907
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:29,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">just had a general kind of question</font>

908
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:31,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">about whether during the revolution we</font>

909
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:35,110
just happen to magically come up with

910
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,549
the right structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've steering</font>

911
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,630
committee we have a program committee we

912
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,150
have a male in this committee now

913
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,740
renamed as a different committee did we

914
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,290
magically just come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the right</font>

915
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:48,790
structure of an organization to deal

916
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:51,580
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> evolution of the internet or do</font>

917
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:54,750
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a structure that's rigid that is</font>

918
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:57,310
really meant as a cookie cutter to

919
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:59,440
create a program move forward create a

920
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:02,110
new program and cycle people through

921
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,810
various roles I wonder if we're a little

922
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:06,580
bit on the rigid side in terms of

923
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:09,310
organizational organizational structure

924
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:11,140
as compared with what we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

925
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:14,140
have into the future I'll give you an

926
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:17,799
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> um if it makes sense for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

927
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:19,839
forum to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups to focus on</font>

928
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,030
a particular operations problem or a

929
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,700
document a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> operations</font>

930
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:26,700
processes hi with this group decide this

931
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,259
is the right way<font color="#CCCCCC"> through nanog to evolve</font>

932
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,629
so i use toss that out is something i

933
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:33,940
can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little bit it's</font>

934
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:36,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting thought yeah we've been</font>

935
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:39,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">living with this structure for what six</font>

936
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:41,710
I don't know however many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years now it</font>

937
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:43,810
seems to work but I'm obviously biased

938
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:48,160
and some I'm in the inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I</font>

939
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:50,110
see what happens we do have a charter

940
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,970
amendment structure such that if

941
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody were to propose changes we</font>

942
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:56,680
could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shredder itself is</font>

943
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,000
fairly it's rigid at a few places but

944
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,460
it's very loose than many others and

945
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,930
that's that was deliberate I believe we

946
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,430
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things and have done things like</font>

947
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:09,850
I create<font color="#CCCCCC"> the marketing working group and</font>

948
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:12,490
things like that that allow us to bend a

949
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:15,850
bit but but in essence<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've proven</font>

950
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:18,430
my point we have codified how this group

951
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:20,529
should work forward as kind of a

952
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,960
structure as if we had in our mind

953
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,990
exactly the right organizational idea of

954
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,430
how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff should move forward</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

955
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,589
I put to you that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet has</font>

956
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,960
evolved in ways that we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

957
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:34,080
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> predicted back six years ago</font>

958
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,170
but we have this rigid structure so how

959
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,900
do you guys see the evolution of of

960
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,670
nanog to meet those<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs or is going to</font>

961
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,560
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a cookie cutter for he</font>

962
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">run forward I personally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

963
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,900
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> person to answer that question</font>

964
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,770
because again I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the inside of the</font>

965
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,990
cookie cutter the it's very interesting

966
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would love to hear and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

967
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:55,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">community would love to hear options i</font>

968
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,450
will submit that that six years ago we

969
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:00,030
needed a structure and we got a

970
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:02,339
structure that seems to have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

971
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,140
decent job of working for us just the

972
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:07,860
fact that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are all here and paid</font>

973
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,720
your registration fees and whatever is a

974
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:15,330
sign that we did go off completely in

975
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:18,209
the wrong direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right Rob seized</font>

976
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:21,630
from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> affiliates speaking on my on</font>

977
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:23,970
my own behalf<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what problem are you</font>

978
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,730
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve is there an identified</font>

979
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:33,689
problem is just just rhetoric trying to

980
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:37,080
get us to think deep thoughts<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

981
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:39,000
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rude here yeah I it's not</font>

982
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,920
clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that there's actually a</font>

983
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,300
problem so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a problem let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

984
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,310
know it was more of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought there's a</font>

985
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,400
as I said there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> structural issue</font>

986
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:51,930
where I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you that eighty or ninety</font>

987
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,570
percent of the traffic on the Internet

988
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:56,609
today's video so why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we focusing</font>

989
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:59,010
eighty or ninety percent of the

conference on video or having a a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sub</font>

1002
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:33,330
more of a structural question did we

1003
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,009
happen to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything right the first</font>

1004
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:38,380
time or can we evolve it

1005
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:39,850
and should we evolve it how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

1006
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,400
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,860
answer but provide my my own feedback as

1009
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:51,640
well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm hearing bill</font>

1010
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:54,880

1011
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:57,100
thought is what do you that that enters

1012
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,670
for me what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want out of nanog</font>

1017
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:12,609
if you dig a little bit deeper<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there</font>

1018
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:15,550
more that as an attendee you would want

00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:18,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get out of this activity or this</font>

tournament I was grateful for it and

1024
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:30,370
happy to see the fantastic agenda new

1025
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,650
blood brought to this meeting I think we

1026
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">got it right by making no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more than four</font>

1027
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:36,670
years for anybody on the program

1028
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:38,650
committee because there's no way all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1029
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:41,020
us would have rotated out when we should

1030
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:45,490
have if it was just left<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to go on</font>

1031
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:47,320
and on and on it was the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> time ok</font>

1032
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:50,339
we have accused of<font color="#E5E5E5"> each of the mics now</font>

1033
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:53,740
so let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the third one back</font>

1034
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:55,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right I you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say the</font>

state to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bill is one of the people</font>

setting up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current structure I am</font>

1039
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:05,380
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> shocked at how well it works</font>

1040
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,210
and most of us who were involved in

1041
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:09,430
setting up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that structure at this point</font>

to our not involved in the governance of

1043
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:14,529
nanog to our great relief you know I

1044
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:17,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">think many of us put in our time and</font>

1045
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:19,540
helped out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> various ways but you know</font>

1046
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,830
it's it stood the test of time and it

1047
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,720
stood the test of time because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1048
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:25,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it was it was a</font>

1049
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,609
collaborative process it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one which</font>

1050
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:29,640
no one was completely happy which means

1051
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:32,500
it was probably a pretty good bargain

1052
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,180
you know it was one in which a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1053
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,730
changes happen in the first couple of

1054
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:40,359
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we did it to fine tune in to</font>

1055
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:42,970
fix the scruffs and the mistakes i think

1056
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:45,370
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to change but i think</font>

1057
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,629
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at you know the folks on the</font>

1058
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,620
program committee the folks are on the

1059
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,570
steering committee the amount of

1060
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:52,330
folks who are are circulating through

1061
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:55,010
the folks in the other committees who

1062
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:56,569
you know have a chance to get involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1063
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:59,090
think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a much better place now</font>

1064
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:02,390
than we were you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> six years ago or</font>

1065
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:03,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten years ago you know and I think we've</font>

1066
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:06,609
got a structure that if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font>

1067
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:09,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change something we can change it</font>

1068
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:12,110
just my two cents absolutely don't

1069
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,240
forget there are charter elections every

1070
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:16,340
year so if you want to anybody wants to

1071
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,660
propose a change to abolish the steering

1072
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,810
committee<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way to</font>

1073
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:22,640
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it let's move forward next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> John</font>

1074
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:24,200

1075
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,759
completely different subject one thing I

1076
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,950
didn't hear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

1077
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,810
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is the number of</font>

1078
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:33,620
presentations that come forward or

1079
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:35,870
submitted and and how many are accepted

1080
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:37,040
so I thought maybe one idea might be for

1081
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the for the group of the program</font>

1082
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,870
committee did I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be fairly</font>

1083
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:43,460
easy to implement has come up with a

1084
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:45,140
best presentation award and second best

1085
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,300
and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you would do is</font>

1086
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,980
actually give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> a discount for the</font>

1087
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,570
next man all over the next nail out that

1088
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,980
they attend and that's something that

1089
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,660
they can take back as a marketing thing

1090
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,250
for their organization to help justify

1091
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,960
it next time if they show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they've</font>

1092
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:58,970
got that sort of thing something to put

1093
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,890
under resume i know we probably not a

1094
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:02,509
good forum for people to prison papers

1095
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:07,160
so maybe something that they could use

1096
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:09,560
as a marketing tool themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks</font>

1097
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,330
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the suggestion um I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't I</font>

1098
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean I I don't know how would you</font>

1099
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:14,390
implement that we'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font>

1100
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:21,080
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a great suggestion and</font>

1101
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:22,970
appreciate it we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1102
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:25,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out who was at what stage since I</font>

1103
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:27,709
guess that one's dead okay well you

1104
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,660
three can decide among you who goes

1105
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:33,110
first and then ask a question please or

1106
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:35,629
make your comment I'm no question just a

1107
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:37,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment that I think bills observation</font>

1108
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,460
was content related not necessarily

1109
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:45,440
structural related having been involved

1110
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:47,390
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom up activist stuff for a long</font>

1111
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,160
time I was sorry Joe provo ITA software

1112
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:53,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">as being for myself blah blah blah blah</font>

1113
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:56,390
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this approach of making an</font>

1114
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:58,100
indirect management organization was a

1115
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,230
direct response to the previous

1116
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,270
structure

1117
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:03,040
of the entity and actually is a pretty

1118
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:06,400
progressive structure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is</font>

1119
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">no direct touch to the content of the</font>

1120
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,690
program via the people that are elected

1121
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:14,799
so vendors or particular factions don't

1122
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:16,930
stack the debt that's the purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as</font>

1123
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,950
for organizing the content that's the

1124
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:25,060
purpose of the of the pc and you know

1125
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:27,939
changes there are pretty open there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1126
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:30,130
there's no prescribed structure we just

1127
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:34,930
happen to have fallen<font color="#E5E5E5"> into certain</font>

1128
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:36,520
patterns for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> program and and yeah i</font>

1129
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:40,899
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't want to try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it too</font>

1130
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:45,550
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a you know thing there but just</font>

1131
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:47,260
just but that there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

1132
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:51,369
restriction against what you just

1133
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:55,359
suggested so wrong with it talk to

1134
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:57,310
people get it done<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right we are</font>

1135
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:59,080
running towards the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time so if</font>

1136
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:01,810
you are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a comment please</font>

1137
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:05,890
move for the microphone now and get in

1139
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:10,690
know two bills point i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1140
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:13,359
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no shortage of content that</font>

1141
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:15,550
directly addresses the challenges of

1142
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:17,859
today's network operator you know i

1143
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:20,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">would say most people who are directly</font>

1144
00:52:17,859 --> 00:52:21,880
in touch with what it takes to operate a

1145
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:23,740
network nowadays either from content

1146
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,900
provider side or from the eyeball side

1147
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:28,089
would say that there's a ton of relevant

1148
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,980
content here and the meeting attendance

1149
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,690
shows that you know i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1150
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,250
agenda was stacked full of stuff that

1151
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:35,410
wasn't relevant people would have a

1152
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,300
really really hard time getting their

1153
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:39,310
employers to pay for them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come here</font>

1154
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:42,700
regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whether we added a hundred</font>

1155
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:45,520
dollars to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the registration so</font>

1156
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:48,399
you know i don't want to repeat what Joe

1157
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,500
said but you know everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

1158
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,500
to submit whatever content they want and

1159
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:59,280
if it's relevant and it's accurate we

1160
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:59,280
should discuss it thank you

1161
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:04,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Greg Dendy Steve asked a good question</font>

1162
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,950
earlier we kind of blew by about whether

1163
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,690
it be better to shorten our rotation on

1164
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,609
sites down to three repeat them every

1165
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:12,130
year or continue with sort of the wide

1166
00:53:09,609 --> 00:53:13,720
rotation I prefer the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide rotation</font>

1167
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,700
places like Albuquerque I got to meet

1168
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,439
some local network operators some post

1169
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,269
grads in the local universities it

1170
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,829
happens everywhere we go and I would be

1171
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:25,269
disappointed to see it pick three cities

1172
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:26,499
and stay there<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right there's</font>

1173
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:30,479
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mine does anyone else have</font>

1174
00:53:26,499 --> 00:53:30,479
anything or shall we call ourselves done

1175
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:36,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's it for the up in</font>

00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:46,059

1179
00:53:42,749 --> 00:53:49,058
take it back and give this some thought

1180
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:50,289
I mean this isn't yeah this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>
