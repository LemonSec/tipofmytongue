25
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,269
built that you only get the records if

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,640
because now when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask us for a name</font>

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,770
it doesn't exist in the DNS we say it's

36
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:30,229
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we got a report not long</font>

68
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,120
it's not so much a test for internal

systems as it is to see what the effect

is on the network other rituals have

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes on we know who to contact</font>

we're counting on that as part of our

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,070
for us the u.s. signatures out there

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't do anything without the</font>

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,609

170
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:55,169
slide that describes it the RFC is

171
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:58,558
fairly easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read you can go check it</font>

172
00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:00,688
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's if you understand bgp and i'll</font>

173
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,999
rise and and that sort of thing it's not

174
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">too difficult to make sense of them but</font>

175
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:06,479
essentially if you just think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of filters</font>

176
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:08,999
being distributed via bgp that's what it

177
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,639
that's primarily what it's used for it

178
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:14,610
is based off of a flow though so you

179
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,379
can't do very complex filters you do a

180
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,110
filter based on the kinds of things you

181
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,879
find in a and the net flow record for

182
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,219
example so things like addresses and

183
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,219
ports and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font>

184
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:28,649
can do certain things based on on that

185
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:32,159
that flow specification so you could

186
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:33,919
either accept packets based on it or you

187
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:37,379
could discard a rate limit or sample

188
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:41,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">netflow sample or redirected to a vrf or</font>

189
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:42,959
something else and just I any time flows

190
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:43,979
back comes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sort of complaint about</font>

191
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,509
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit because I think it's the</font>

192
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong approach to doing distributed</font>

193
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:49,469
filters doing this over bgp but you know

194
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:52,279
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it lemon to we make lemonade</font>

195
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:55,109
so you know we sort of take what we go

196
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,939
so doing enter a<font color="#CCCCCC"> esflow suspect many of</font>

197
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:59,609
you who probably do full spec probably

198
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:03,179
don't do this or don't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a great</font>

199
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:07,378
degree so what I'm proposing is that you

200
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:09,239
do it enter a s basis something that you

201
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:11,369
probably not doing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can think of</font>

hole on steroids so rather than just

204
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,990
dropping packets based on a destination

205
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,550
address you could drop it based on some

206
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things basically things that you</font>

207
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,699
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> find in the net flow record so you</font>

208
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,620

210
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,419
we want to do this many of you here with

00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:31,689
our bogan route server or heard of this

212
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:33,419
at least one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the common problems for</font>

213
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:35,919
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing bug on filtering is that</font>

214
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,380
one it's difficult in many cases to

215

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually prevent source</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Vogon addresses</font>

216
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,700
it or it's difficult to actually prevent

217
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,800
bogans if someone's announces more

218
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,240
specific so you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a more</font>

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,380
complete vote on filtering solution

220
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,209
using a false by because it's a real

221
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,620
fireball filter that try actually

222
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,839
implementing and you can do other things

223
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to real-time blacklister will perhaps</font>

224
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,310
whatever you could dream up it does

225
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:59,439
introduce something into your appearing

226
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,939
relationship perhaps so now your abuse

227
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,970
handler has to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in it an</font>

228
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,820
appearing relationship maybe and so I've

229
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,320
been to a few appearing events and so I

230
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">think a Bering coordinator already</font>

231
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,800
exists I didn't have to actually make

232
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,459
that up but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought that was a nice</font>

233
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,829
pun so what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> a community flow spec</font>

234
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:19,630
route implementation look like well for

235
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:22,029
us initially the thing that makes sense

236
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">is doing a bug on feet over them and I</font>

237
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,370
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it makes a whole lot of</font>

238
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,540
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually do a destination base</font>

239
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,000
because we can already do that that's

240
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,040
real simple by using it as a source base

241
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,089
that means using it in place of where

242
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,500
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a you r PF</font>

243
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,570
check or maybe you can't use that

244
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,980
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your infrastructure so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

245
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,019
it for that reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then maybe</font>

246
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,820
providing it now our car feed may be

247
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:44,920
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> some communities so things like</font>

248
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,620
troublesome multicast groups which are

249
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,569
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all the swamp stuff that</font>

250
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,459
happens in multicasts is very difficult

251
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:55,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to manage manually so maybe putting that</font>

252
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:58,660
into a flow spec feed or maybe doing a

253
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,640
black lists of botnet controllers or or

254
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,829
any of that sort of thing and perhaps

255
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,850
maybe a compute community vetted thing

256
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:05,800
and this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where this has come</font>

257
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,990
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times on the less people</font>

258
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,729
said would it be cool if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could inject</font>

259
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,190
basically a filter into someone else's

260
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,540
router and that sort of sounds cool for

261
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,089
you but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it sounds cool</font>

262
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,890
for everybody else but the way we wanted

263
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:21,699
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this there's a couple of things</font>

264
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:24,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to apply them to sort</font>

265
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:25,620
of protect the Pure's routers from

266
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,880
basically being

267
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,430
getting all kinds of weird instantiated

268
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:34,090
state or essentially black holing all

269
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,439
sorts of valid address space as path

270
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,360
prepending probably doesn't do a hula

271
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,490
whole lot but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably do that</font>

272
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,560
of course we'd probably tagged it no

273
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,650
export and maybe even further restricted

274
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,689
within na s here's what it looks like if

275
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,740
you've never done<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow spec you're</font>

277
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,370
this on your juniper routers today I've

278
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,430
heard that alcatel-lucent has an

00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,820
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually use that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm familiar with</font>

juniper<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I've heard cisco has some</font>

283
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,330
interest in implementing it they have

284
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,410
not seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it implemented there so we're</font>

285
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,490
pretty much talking about juniper and

286
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,140
this is what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like it's not</font>

287
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,430
terribly difficult under under your

288
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,170
routing options this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the sort of</font>

289
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,380
thing you would have and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just show you</font>

290
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:17,709
a very simple example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bug on flow</font>

291
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,910
spec here and here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the receiver</font>

292
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,790
side would look like you'd set up a

293
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,890
another I net groupon just on the flow

294
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,420
routes and basically just want to get

295
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,870
flows back routes from somebody that

296
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">aniline and in this case if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

297
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,680
get let's say flow spec routes for this

298
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,540
prototype project that we're doing you'd

299
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,349
have to specify<font color="#CCCCCC"> no validate because</font>

300
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:41,680
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to be the</font>

301
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:43,330
originator of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these prefixes so</font>

302
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,579
this has come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on the list a couple of</font>

303
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">times as i said this might be real nice</font>

304
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,840
if people can instantiate filters and

305
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,580
other people's routers that's certainly

306
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,990
good for them but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so much for</font>

307
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,880
people whose whose routers are getting

308
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,770
that state applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know about</font>

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think I'd want 5,000</font>

310
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,390
filters that someone else actually

311
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,219
defined and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no idea why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or what</font>

312
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,960
they're doing so i don't i'm not sure

313
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually work i think</font>

314
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,860
people some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

315
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,360
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the focus if some</font>

316
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,950
people really wanted that we could try

317
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,060
they suppose and so I just list a few

318
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,180
bullet points you could read this later

319
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,979
and how might that actually work so if

320
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,390
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it a try I've got some</font>

321
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,970
prototype stuff set up on a couple of

322
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">junipers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've gotten a lab and you</font>

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to shoot me an email will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

324
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,030
give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a test roll and we can set up in</font>

325
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,410
a manner that just says except the

326
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,520
routes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to die you just</font>

327
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,189
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the counters and see what it's</font>

328
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,179
actually doing

329
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:35,608
before you you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go a little</font>

330
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:37,319
further and try to actually drop some

331
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:39,689
packets or weight limit or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

332
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:51,089
wouldn t end up doing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

333
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:52,769
it any questions maybe one person one

334
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:54,419
question is the co-author or the flow

335
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:57,899
spec I'm glad to hear such a

336
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:59,790
presentation I missed in the slides what

337
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,259
is your action on the filters you're

338
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,230
sending because trust like allows you to

339
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:06,929
drop rate limits redirect what exactly

340
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:09,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are discard proposal yeah and this</font>

341
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:12,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an example here this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

342
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:14,100
basically this discarding day and so the

343
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,689
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> was to come up with sort of a menu</font>

344
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,399
of options that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do you could</font>

345
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:18,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">very limited or filter or just accept it</font>

346
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,609
if you want to try it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at</font>

347
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:26,790
counters right all right very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thank</font>

348
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:30,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next we</font>

349
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,649
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron Hughes from six connect</font>

350
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,770
hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoo that'll wake you up okay this</font>

351
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,170
presentation is on best current

352
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:14,220
practices which is not something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

353
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,750
discussed too often in nanog or<font color="#CCCCCC"> erin and</font>

354
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,710
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a gap between the two that's</font>

355
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:26,560
a funny thing to talk about so what's a

356
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">PCP today it's go to your qualified</font>

357
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,839
favorite search engine and search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

358
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,430
how to implement things it's hopping on

359
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,320
pound IX and talking to your buddies

360
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:39,280
maybe you know a subject matter expert

361
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,930
that knows better than you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you've</font>

362
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,850
got a whole heck of a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of patience</font>

363
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,250
you can search through presentations on

364
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,720
historical man odds and hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

365
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:51,430
presentation that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at is</font>

366
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,920
still current so what do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

367
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,689
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this well one option is nothing</font>

368
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,120
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we've been doing for a</font>

369
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,830
long time another option is actually to

370
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:05,100
do something about it and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

371
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,100
to create a repository of<font color="#E5E5E5"> living</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vcp s</font>

372
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:12,880
so the idea being to ask subject matter

373
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,980
experts to submit papers on topics so

374
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,000
you share<font color="#E5E5E5"> them with the community and to</font>

375
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:23,320
keep them<font color="#CCCCCC"> alive current accurate and</font>

376
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,340
searchable why do we do this well I and

377
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,520
others<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the community believes</font>

378
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,260
something like this needs to be done

379
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,470
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means that things start</font>

380
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,750
to get better as an example you know

381
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">better filters or subnetting or security</font>

382
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,070
cleaner registry information perhaps

383
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's more secure perhaps we can actually</font>

384
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">get people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement things like anti</font>

385
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,969
spoon filters and and hopefully we get a

386
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,830
better internet operator community out

387
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:52,960
of it so as an example as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

388
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I could write a document on the best</font>

389
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:59,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">current practice for submitting an ipv6</font>

390
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:01,450
/ 32 as an ISP I would submit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp to</font>

391
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,089
the site<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the community could either</font>

392
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,700
accept or reject or maybe you vote up or

393
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,050
down people could read it and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

394
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,880
know something better they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could update</font>

395
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,300
that document and resubmit it so it

396
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">stays current and more acumen document</font>

397
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,780
in theory gets better

398
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,180
over time and then someone who wouldn't

399
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:23,260
otherwise know how to do what evers been

400
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:27,670
written then builds a better network or

401
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:29,500
has a better operational practice so

402
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,540
where does it live<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is always</font>

403
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,550
the sticky point in this kind of

404
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:38,170
environment nano generally caters to the

405
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,959
twenty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the crowd that doesn't</font>

406
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:43,750
generally need vcpr<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCBs because they do</font>

407
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,680
it in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different way than the majority</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the companies with networks Aaron on</font>

409
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,079
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand could do it because their</font>

410
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,760
official party line is that if the

411
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wants to do it and they could</font>

412
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,350
host something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

413
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of scope creep and it's a fairly</font>

414
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:05,230
large audience to convince to make a

415

change to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron operates today I</font>

416
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,099
etfs an option they have a pretty good

417
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,660
management system for documents although

418
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,719
their timeline is fairly long and that

419
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,130
makes it a little difficult for<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs so</font>

420
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is to generate a</font>

421
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of organization a</font>

422
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:23,170
good neutral choice for where to put

423
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">BCPs and no this is not creating another</font>

424
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,620
meeting this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just creating an</font>

425
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:31,780
organization on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the site to host it and</font>

426
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:34,510
operate these practices so who's

427
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:38,320
involved well people from the community

428
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:41,260
like you hopefully enough neutral people

429
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,659
like somebody from an OPC somebody from

430
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a see somebody from Aaron board a</font>

431
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,920
few subject matter experts to actually

432
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,689
start writing some documents and anybody

433
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,100
who's interested in going to their time

434
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:54,970
to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> get something like this kicked</font>

435
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,770
off and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice to get a group</font>

436
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">of together of larger</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than the five</font>

437
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,360
people that started out with to have a

438
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:06,700
buff a good discussion hammer out the

439
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:09,219
details of how this actually operates so

440
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,080
I'm just looking for a show<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hands is</font>

441
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,450
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that people would be</font>

442
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:18,850
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing further support on</font>

443
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:21,610
you know doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something with okay okay</font>

444
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">so people like the idea of BCPs show of</font>

445
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,129
hands anybody says you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> find another</font>

446
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:30,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">hobby you're wasting our time</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">alright Liz one alright so the next</font>

448
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,960
steps I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have time to</font>

449
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,390
do this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> nano but the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of being</font>

450
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">a host of off to finalize the details I</font>

451
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,880
know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some space left available</font>

452
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:46,210
in the box tomorrow but i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

453
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,500
what it conflicts with there are there a

454
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,120
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

455
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,340
you know do we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a pending</font>

456
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,219
versus accepted kind of living document

457
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,919
distinction or draft horses live do one

458
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,390
limit who can post are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum</font>

459
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,120
number of requires for the posters do

460
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,090
anything's like authentication how does

461
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,010
a doc move from draft to live status all

462
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:08,139
kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions and that and that's</font>

463
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,000
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to have enough</font>

464
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,380
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room to sit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down together</font>

465
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,510
to hash it out so it's not a

466
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,370
dictatorship but it's a good common

467
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:20,800
decision from a nice slice of the

468
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:22,510
community and between now and then i'm

469
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,290
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and kick off an</font>

470
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:28,300
organization something neutral and it

471
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,760
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be renamed and I don't care where it</font>

472
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,210
lives after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can figure it out in the</font>

473
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:37,780
ball and start by publishing one

474
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:40,480
document as I mentioned in the example I

475
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,149
started writing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp for ipv6</font>

write a document kick it off figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

478
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:52,960
how to manage this process and put it up

on the site i started<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list and again I</font>

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really care where it lives but I</font>

that priority list of BCPs to publish

our why your<font color="#CCCCCC"> provider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add all</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers and its infrastructure</font>

498
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,340
and its servers and everything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

499
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,110
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would go a huge way to</font>

500
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,250
clearing up some of the messes that are

501
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,100
out there and some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller</font>

502
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,230
providers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do it so so part of the</font>

503
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,379
reason this kicked off is I gave a

504
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:05,200
presentation at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin on implementing v6</font>

505
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,520
for isps and and someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> got up to the</font>

506
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,250
mic and said well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a great</font>

507
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,720
kickoff for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bcp and had several people</font>

508
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,860
come up to me afterwards saying you know

509
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,110
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really looking for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a place where</font>

510
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,699
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find documents like this and it's</font>

511
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,189
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of subjects it's fairly widespread</font>

512
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,260
and I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that generally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking the</font>

513
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:23,380
content that's available here at nano is

514
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,480
not for beginners and and it isn't it is

515
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,360
very difficult to find documents to say

516
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,180
this is what's generally speaking the

517
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,040
best model for implementing X Y or Z and

518
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,630
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole idea behind this</font>

519
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,159
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I completely agree have I've just</font>

520
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,620
gone to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very recently</font>

521
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,050
where one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my partner's challenged me</font>

522
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,659
and said well if if using private

523
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,820
addresses on all of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> links between my</font>

524
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,140
sites and all that is so bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> why don't</font>

525
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,580
you show me all the documents on the

526
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,610
internet that say that's bad and you

527
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,770
know what yeah there's a nice number of

528
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,870
threads on manag that say why that's bad

529
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,330
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just a bunch of email and to</font>

530
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,340
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's you know has a/c in their</font>

531
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,620
title a bunch of email means nothing to

532
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,540
them but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll show me a nice document</font>

533
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,590
published by some standards organization

534
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,450
somewhere that says this is a bad idea

535
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,010
because clearly if no one said it's a

536
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,930
bad idea it must be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

537
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,330
well there's none let me tell you

538
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,470
there's not right and lots of

539
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,250
misinformation<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there on search</font>

540
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,720
engines I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help cheers thank you</font>

541
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,180
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Danny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> McPherson are just going to</font>

542
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">come in on the IETF side and I know that</font>

543
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,360
bcp publication the IHF is usually does

544
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,770
take quite a while but it's a lot

545
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,740
quicker than a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the standards</font>

546
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,360
track documents in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF and one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

547
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,650
the reasons it takes so long is because

548
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">bedding or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the community feedback</font>

549
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,040
process for that which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

550
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,480
huge challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> here because if there's</font>

551
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,060
disagreement what's the process around

552
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and sort of the publication means</font>

553
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,440
for everything from updates to that to

554
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,240
erratum to other things and so I

555
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,790
wouldn't completely discount the IETF

556
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,530
model I guess is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm asking and if</font>

557
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,330
there are things that need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move in</font>

558
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ITF I'm sure that the operations</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">area is Curie or wherever they reside in</font>

560
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,510
the ITF would be amenable to that as

561
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,159
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know it seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you kind</font>

562
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of shut that off and it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even an</font>

563
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,830
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of timelines when I think</font>

564
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,570
that there are things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

565
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,210
probably do within the ITF framework and

566
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,460
employ a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the IP IETF publication</font>

567
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,590
structure and you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their bcp</font>

568
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,690
publication framework and so forth so

569
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,250
anyway I oh I see it being discard here

570
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side of that too is the inter</font>

571
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,470
region function if you expect a pack or

572
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,060
Europe or other regions to be at employ

573
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,860
this one of them have feedback versus

574
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,290
this being specific to the Americas or

575
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,490
just north america as and so forth so

576
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,810
anyway I see it being blown off

577
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,460
completely here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think that's</font>

578
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,379
such a good idea because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

579
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,120
end up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of fragmented you</font>

580
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,530
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs in different regions and</font>

581
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:44,459
everybody's gonna have different update

582
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:46,899
procedures and so forth but anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

583
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,480
certainly contribute that to the list if

584
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,850
I ETF is the right place that's great if

585
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,010
there's an existing process that works

586
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:56,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">great if one needs modification and we</font>

587
00:23:54,010 --> 00:24:01,260
should modify it but something certainly

588
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:04,930
needs to change at a minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ITF bcp</font>

589
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:08,110
I guess I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut repository is not well</font>

590
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:10,420

591
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,719
know maybe the answer is we use that

592
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,830
piece of of an existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> process and give</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> some marketing in these other</font>

594
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,129
meetings I don't know what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is</font>

595
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,770
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying there's certainly a gap</font>

596
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:24,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">that needs to be filled and love to have</font>

597
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:30,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of input on the list to help</font>

598
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:32,620
out yeah Aaron um this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a great idea I</font>

599
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,420
don't like Danny I don't think the IETF

600
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,610
is a good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's a</font>

608
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,929
we've talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing this in the</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know kind of convergence on anything</font>

611
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,120
just that you know it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a work</font>

612
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:04,570
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been aware that it's something</font>

of Danny Reyes about what gets branded

<font color="#CCCCCC">without whatever this thing is and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

616
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,489
does that branding occur right<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big</font>

617
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,710
process deal and you know I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

618
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,200
it's insurmountable it just means that a

619
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,530
process would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be built and in</font>

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,419
order to in order to be effective and to

621
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,220
avoid the issues that you raised that

622
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:28,630
process would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be efficient</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

623
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,270
streamlined right because when the

624
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,919
problems with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF is you know bcp</font>

625
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,410
is a very formal piece of something

626
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and it goes through a lot of a lot</font>

627
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:42,460
of peer review levels of process in this

628
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:45,010
sort of thing right it again you know

629
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:48,340
best current practice in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8020 model</font>

630
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,840
doesn't require as much scrutiny this is

631
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,330
this is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the community</font>

632
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,230
that's not trying to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

633
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">right say this is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help the majority</font>

00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,130
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community not the minority I</font>

635
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,659
don't you know 701 1239 whatever they

636
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need bc fees they can figure their</font>

637
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:07,330
own stuff out right the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

638
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,830
room doesn't need this but the rest of

639
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,129
the community does you know you're

640
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,059
reminded me of one thing um there is

641
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:15,040
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of people who come to</font>

642
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:17,110
now now for the first time and they do

643
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,850
you know I mean I what I'm saying it's

644
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:23,229
done under sell the need for that at

645
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:27,209
nanog as well and Igor could you come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

646
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,210
when Mike that back one is really equity

647
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:39,820
funny that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I was</font>

648
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:43,360
standing last so as one of the people

649
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,850
part of putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> this together we don't</font>

650
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,250
mean to discount the ITF it very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

651
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:52,389
could be an option the big concern is

652
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:58,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the ITF ops area does not represent</font>

653
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:59,860
the operational community of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana and we</font>

00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:03,030

whether we adopt the publication process

of IETF and you know give it in a

658

different forum or whatnot these are

today in any region or

globally so this is just a start to try

00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,950
and make things better so this Danny one

today's point and some of the slowest

696

your slowness issues to to igors and so

697

00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,730
community side and some of the structure

724
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,429
contribute and don't spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much time</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea behind the v6 addressing is</font>

730
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,100
that it's a well-known current topic

731
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,570
that people have interest in so it's a

732
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,719
good place to start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out if the</font>

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,880
you'll end up building the same thing
