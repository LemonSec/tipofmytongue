00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:37,720
remember myself from last time when I

00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,520
announced the route the right laughs<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the launch of vibe labs that we started</font>

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,760
in September last year I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an update of that because last</font>

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:54,339
in the meantime there's actually a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,930
more content and more tools more you

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:00,519
know interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff happening on the</font>

web labs website just a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> in summary</font>

20
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,408
of what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> red laughs all those who are</font>

21
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:07,000
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of it it's um it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

22
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:09,370
community platform that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying to</font>

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,560
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the NCC that the NCC can use</font>

24
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,010
also to put out new ideas we have

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,720
prototypes new tools presented to the

26
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,300
community and find out if it's useful

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,250
and get gather some feedback and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,470
out if you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want us to develop</font>

29
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,409
it further or not but it's also meant

30
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,630
for members of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community to</font>

31
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:30,190
contribute anything you might find

<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting you know that you might</font>

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,509
think is interesting for others to use

34
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,719
like any measurements you're doing

35
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:39,369
research results tools you've been using

36

for your operations that you want to

41
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,949
briefly give you some snapshots of

42
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,839
what's currently on the side not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

43
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,649
to go into much detail and they're

00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,829
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resource explainer and was</font>

45
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,630
presented and demonstrated in detail

46
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:10,750
yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my colleagues in a</font>

Wilms who is who presented that during a

48
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:17,280
tool to track and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a quick</font>

49
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,799
summary it's a like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-stop shop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,020
anything you always wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know about</font>

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:28,000
IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> or is numbers it's linked</font>

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:30,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">to all the IR allocation later like 10</font>

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,800
years of routing histories behind it I'm

54
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,560
dns information reverse dns

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,730
it's linked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some black lists and some</font>

56
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,430
geo location as well so I take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font>

57
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,399
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some screenshots of various</font>

58
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:48,730
types of information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find</font>

59
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,310
it's linked from the labs website but

60
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:55,570
you can also get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it directly to Rex</font>

61
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:58,200
type net and yeah please let us know

62
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,090
what you think about it is this useful

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,760
anything else you're looking for you

64
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,590
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> could we improve that it's just a</font>

65
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,149
prototype at the moment I mean it's

66
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,820
working and stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still kind of</font>

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,130
playing with it so don't blame us if it

68
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,500
may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know breaks or if something</font>

69
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:18,400
as not as pretty as it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be at the</font>

70
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment a similar thing is I mean the</font>

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,250
ripe NCC has been doing your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

72
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,010
measurements over time like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the house</font>

73
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,500
count and test traffic measurements and

74
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,600
we put some pretty interface on that to

75
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,550
make it easier for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access all</font>

76
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,280
the data behind it it's called net sense

77
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:37,030
it's also explained on on the right labs

78
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,890
website what what it does and yeah you

79
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,750
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your eyes</font>

80
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:45,040
number in or your IP address in<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

81
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:48,220
what it shows you might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen the</font>

82
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,500
announcement of that on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano mailing</font>

83
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,359
list I announced that we done some

84
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,640
measurements for an hour but the

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,370
pollution of 1 / 8 just to see how much

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that even used actually we also use</font>

87
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,050
Rex for that and some other measurements

88
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,420
we've been doing internally and there is

89
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,989
a some statistics about that honorable

90
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:11,140
apps and web site and then a while ago

91
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:13,060
we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we're doing some rapid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

92
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,910
measurements also internally at the NCC

93
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,310
but we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> AM seen a lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

94
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the community of measuring various and</font>

95
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,650
our types of things traffic in our pants

96
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,810
popular websites other things so we put

97
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,299
together a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little like</font>

98
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,650
stuff like a compilation of them

99
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,419
measurements others are doing and I'm

100
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on a on a follow-up of that</font>

101
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,859
because in the meantime other people

102
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,410
have contacted me and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me</font>

103
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,080
if I wouldn't I want to include their

104
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,889
their work as well so if you're doing

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,300
something related to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 measurements</font>

106
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:51,150
you would like to have included<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

please let me know and recently we also

108
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,909
looked into<font color="#CCCCCC"> both the growth of our</font>

109
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,000

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,410
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting and for the ripe</font>

ripe ncc membership or in the right

112
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,830

follow-up<font color="#E5E5E5"> article we also looked at the</font>

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,380

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're looking bit more into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

121

maybe some speculation or why some of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the results are the way they are instead</font>

behaving properly and again based on

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,760
that we've done some and turn

132
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,950
measurements to an end and we publish

133

the results of that also on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the side so</font>

yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> browse around and see what some may</font>

be what may be of use or interest for

your particular work that's just the

working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a on a new layout a bit of</font>

easier structure for people to leave

comments and participate on the side at

things and forums and there are darlings

144
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:29,060
to forums on each article but then in a

145
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,080
couple of weeks hopefully have a new

146
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:36,169
lay out a new site ready were in Mexico

147
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:40,210
makes it more lively<font color="#CCCCCC"> and easier to leave</font>

148
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:43,159
comments so yeah that's all I wanted to

149
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,530

160
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,289
don't see anybody coming to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> light so</font>

161
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,880
thank you no questions but I'm sure

162
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,880
you'll be around if somebody has one

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,330
I always wonder how right does such good

164
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:48,400
work all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm John Waterman</font>

I'm actually not directly affiliated

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:08,410
for the specific autonomous system

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:10,530
number 19 26 to the top there's not a

191
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:16,870
line is CBL and xbl which tracks so

192
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,199
closely together you can hardly tell

193
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:22,170
them apart and at the target date which

194
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,750
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the little box there</font>

195
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:31,199
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a drop it's slight</font>

196
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,200
but it's noticeable so that might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

197
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:39,059
right and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another way of looking</font>

198
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:41,639
at it notice there's now a y-axis on the

199
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:46,170
right side that's volume has a number of

200
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:49,920
spam messages and an additional curve

201
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:52,559
which is spam volume we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from</font>

202
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,170
CBL they send us some custom data and we

203
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,319
really appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and on the spam</font>

204
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,628
volume well it's not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear I mean</font>

205
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:02,670
there is a brief spike down at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that date</font>

206
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:06,059
but it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell it from noise</font>

207
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:10,410
that's a little inconclusive here's

208
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:14,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">another one asn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6167 once again on the</font>

209
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:17,100
CBL and xbl data it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's</font>

210
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:20,099
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> decrease but it's Pam volume not</font>

211
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,069
really and even on the CBL on xbl post

212
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:29,910
data it goes now for a little while and

213
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:31,618
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes back up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so those two</font>

214
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,019
were we basically picked by just looking

215
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:35,759
for a SNS it had many<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDL listings we're</font>

216
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,759
favoring CBL here just because we have

217
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,829
the volume data from them but then we

218
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked for autonomous systems that</font>

219
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:46,399
actually had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> downtrend on the time</font>

220
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">period of interest and there's lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

221
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">AAS ends that don't have many listings a</font>

222
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,369
lot of educational<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs that happen to</font>

223
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,079
go down right<font color="#CCCCCC"> then but you know the</font>

224
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:58,170
numbers are so low and it varies so much

225
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:02,189
wasn't very interesting the top one was

226
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:07,378
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 9262 we already looked</font>

227
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:09,509
at but here's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one 70 15 and once</font>

228
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:15,059
again there's that downtrend at that

229
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:18,209
time on CBL and xbl now on the volume

230
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:20,360
well yeah maybe there was a spike down

231
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:22,920
at a time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if so it didn't last I</font>

232
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,959
mean you have to wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> if doing away</font>

233
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,969
with one botnet didn't let an even

234
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:35,579
spammy or one get in here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another SN</font>

235
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:36,579
7018 steeper down turn on CBL and xbl

236
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:41,859
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> phenom</font>

237
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:44,469
on the volume so ok let's try just

238
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,569
looking at the autonomous systems with

239
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,579
the highest volume numbers the volume

240
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:50,559
y-axis is on the left here just because

241
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:54,160
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only one we're showing and</font>

242
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:58,029
this is beginning to look like they all

243
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,209
showed a spike down all the top ones at

244
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:03,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that time and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there were spikes</font>

245
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:09,719
down on the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> of November and maybe</font>

246
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,720
on about the 27 / 28 of October which

247
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:15,549
makes us wonder if you guys do another

248
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:17,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">takedown around any of those dates we're</font>

249
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:19,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">very interested in more takedowns so</font>

250
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,100
that we can examine<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data and try to</font>

251
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,920
characterize what it really looks like

252
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:30,279
so anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is of that we're quite</font>

253
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:33,099
interested and here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another view we</font>

254
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,569
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have from CBL botnet data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

255
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,819
telling us what botnet they think

256
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:40,889
infests each IP address for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the volume</font>

257
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:45,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">data and we see the spikes down</font>

258
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:49,269
interestingly in almost all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> botnets</font>

259
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:51,730
which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little puzzling do botnets</font>

260
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,829
take vacations it's like you know we're

261
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:57,100
not going to spam today and as spammers

262
00:12:53,829 --> 00:13:02,799
have correlated the time periods<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

263
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:08,020
campaigns run-outs do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and cleaning</font>

264
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:12,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the pipes that might be it dude</font>

265
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:15,290
mmm<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right well and the botnet</font>

266
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's far i took down see way down in</font>

267
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,730
the bottom where I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it marked with</font>

268
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,599
the box that<font color="#E5E5E5"> little gold line that's the</font>

269
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:25,700
one they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and yes there is a</font>

270
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,200
decrease at the target time that stays

271
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,340
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the other</font>

272
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,670
decreases we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing look like</font>

273
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:36,410
they may be because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other botnets</font>

274
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:39,050
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously the next step is the</font>

275
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,819
botnets / autonomous system so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

276
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,199
investigate that directly this is a work

277
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,240
in progress we're just showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font>

Sammy and uni will be working on that

283
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:02,800
they're sitting here in the audience

3.5 million messages to eight point six

thousand at the target time factor for

290
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,550
that seems substantial and it did stay

291
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,230
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a couple of weeks with also</font>

over time they saw a similar decrease at

295
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:35,090
the same time their order of botnets

296
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,310
they're showing is different because you

297
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,050
know they're using different spam traps

298
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:43,010
but what we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> does seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to track</font>

modest here that they think what they

documenting this in detail and we're

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,770
going to dig in in greater detail so

317
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,120
that we can see more what's going on one

318

of the goals of this project is

319
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,610
eventually to produce a reputation

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:46,420
incorporate into an econometric model

325
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:49,210
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to show how this can</font>

provide economic incentives for everyone

to do better at cleaning and stuff up I

don't do that part we have professors to

come REE I mean it's just really

335
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,040
impressive what those guys do<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

in this presentation that's it questions

questions for John questions for

341
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,680
gentlemen anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a couple</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes maybe you're shy to get up at</font>

343
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:43,270
the mic this early in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning you're</font>

344
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:44,859
shaking off the equinox hangover okay

345
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:50,850
you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked a question oh but you</font>

346
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a presentation okay thanks John</font>

347
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,460
that's the lighter the light edition

348
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:16,269
as usual the mic at the nano podium is a

349
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:18,819
little too tall for me good morning

350
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:21,849
everybody welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Wednesday I'm</font>

351
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:25,148
surprised how many people are out here

352
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:26,408
and looking kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of awake I didn't go</font>

353
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:28,329
out late last night but I did go out

354
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:32,070
late Monday and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm still getting my</font>

355
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,070
voice back so please bear with me

00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:45,159
bind and<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP and a few other things we</font>

359
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:46,570
do like a DNS root server but I asked

360
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:51,489
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time this morning to talk about</font>

361
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">some technology in the v4 v6 coexistence</font>

362
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:56,100
area that we think is interesting and

363
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're making available to the community</font>

364
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:04,029
so we've all gotten the memo by now

365
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:06,450
unallocated ipv4 is running out at but

366
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:08,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">we probably have a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

367
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,049
functionally it's already gone for many

368
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,460
large operators people are coping today

369
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,470
with the fact that the next time they

370
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,840
want to go back for more addresses there

371
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:21,759
will not be previously unallocated ipv4

372
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:24,178
for them the issue there of course is

373
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that applications are not v6 enabled and</font>

374
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:30,519
users aren't using v6 there's an app for

375
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,100
that but it speaks before and it's going

376
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:36,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to for some time to come there's a very</font>

377
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:40,090
very long tail here content providers

378
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,590
are in kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same boat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and isp and</font>

379
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,789
access providers are going to be in the

380
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,789
position of having to bridge that gap

381
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:50,049
because you need address space to grow

382
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,049
networks but you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make your users</font>

00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:56,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">change so there's a need again not news</font>

384
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:58,570
for ipv4 ipv6 coexistence technologies

385
00:18:56,489 --> 00:19:01,450
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a variety of technologies</font>

386
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,009
being discussed a lot of development

that use it host-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual stack light</font>

will be

successful and we're here to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

396
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:31,220
on one particular technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual-stack</font>

397
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,180
light which has been developed within

00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:38,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RL there is the draft which</font>

be moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the next stage and its</font>

401
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:46,250
life as an RFC the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea behind</font>

402
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,190
dual-stack light is that it allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> v4</font>

403
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:52,750
applications to communicate with v for

404
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:55,210
servers and peers over v6 infrastructure

405
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:58,310
one address-family transition router

after can handle a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of clients the</font>

00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:04,159
basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into technical</font>

408
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:08,590
detail but the basic idea is you tunnel

409
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:13,540
v4 over v6 infrastructure and then NAT

410
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:13,540
to further v4 interactions

411
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,270
the basic idea from as to how it behaves

412
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,160
for users and providers the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network's it</font>

413
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,810
for them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network side from as a</font>

414
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,300
network operator which you see is both

415
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,879
v4 and v6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this is a v6</font>

delegation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer site there's</font>

a v4 delegation for the after the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tenth</font>

418
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,550
that the tunnel concentrator the

419
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,530
customer sees business as usual v6 our

420
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,870
applications can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6 it's</font>

421
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:55,389
completely transparent v4 only

422
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:57,729
applications also just work so what

423
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,740
we've done what I see is done is with

424

support<font color="#E5E5E5"> from comcast for which we're</font>

their networks they're going to be

various ways people are going to

443
00:21:52,780 --> 00:22:00,610
accommodate the issues around the need

444
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:04,390
to have v4 and v6 coexist in networks

445
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:05,709
for the foreseeable future dual stack

446
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,470
light is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one of the tools in the</font>

447
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:11,440
kit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do think that the use case</font>

448
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:15,400
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the initial use case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it was</font>

449
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,900
large access networks where there's love

450
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,030
there's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large installed base of</font>

451
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,060
users and applications that only know

452
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:25,389
before however we do think the use case

453
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,159
goes way beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you're growing a</font>

454
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:29,290
network pretty soon you're only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

455
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,309
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow a network with v6 public</font>

456

458

459
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:45,820
have to be looking at something like

460
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:47,649
this so we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be taking a</font>

461
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,259
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this it's open source it's</font>

462
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:52,870
freely available and we want to hear

463
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:56,009
from you we're setting up we have set up

464
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usual open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source support mechanisms</font>

465
00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:01,870
which you can find on the website the

466
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:05,168
usual mailing lists we're also setting

467
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:08,100
up the after forum which is based on the

468
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:12,909
forums we do around our other software

469
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:15,850
products it's a way for users to work

470
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:18,369
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us on development on funding on</font>

471
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:21,748
road maps for weather where the software

472
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:26,769
should go early access for testing and

473
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:29,230
benefits of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind we is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C is always</font>

474
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:32,169
here at nanog we go to our meetings or

475
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,610
at IETF we're in the community and we

476
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:35,710
would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you or just drop</font>

477
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:39,908
me or the product manager for after a

478
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:41,169
note and try it out let us<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what you</font>

479
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:43,720
think let us know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it could be more</font>

480
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:48,009
useful in this brave new world<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we're walking into and unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>
