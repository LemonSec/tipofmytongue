1
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:09,510
okay so before we get started I'll just

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,460
a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other bits of administrivia</font>

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,349
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the root server</font>

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,480
session in here so we're going to be

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,720
talking about unique basically

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,369
unix-based<font color="#E5E5E5"> root servers to some extent</font>

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,009
how they deployed<font color="#CCCCCC"> at exchanges but also</font>

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,810
just generally and if you're interested

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,369
so this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp sac</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buff that's</font>

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:32,699
in the room next door that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way through</font>

11
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,519
that through that wall yeah run<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the other thing is downstairs on</font>

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fourth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> floor so it's not on the same</font>

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,980
floor as here but then stairs there's

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,079
the we're calling it like the vent the

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,550
vendor collaboration suite but

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,309
everybody's like what the hell is that

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,050
what the hell is that about is it like

19
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,669
but where the vendors go to hang out and

20
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,649
collaborate at how much they can get

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money out of us actually it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,270
what we've got them there is the guys

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,239
from comcast and a couple of other

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,760
vendors they've got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> n2n v6 native</font>

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,798
dual stack stuff so if you remember the

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,658
demo that they did in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philadelphia this</font>

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an evolution of that they've got some</font>

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,000
more vendors involved there's some

29
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,590
demonstration of both v4 and v6 server

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,380
load balancing as well so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,020
some pretty new new appliances<font color="#CCCCCC"> too to do</font>

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,170
that so that's downstairs on the floor

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,570
below<font color="#E5E5E5"> um bit down the escalators</font>

34
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,850
basically so do go visit them during

35
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,929
things like coffee breaks and that kind

36
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,119
of stuff I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're wrapping up</font>

37
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,979
down there for for now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we'll get</font>

38
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,150
started I first speaker today is really

39
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:39,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">sad just insecure from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am-6 and chris</font>

40
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,500
from switching data and and it's chris

41
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,298
gonna do the talking or are you going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,250
do the talking your boca it's a double

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,680
act right and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

44
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,960
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some testing that they've that</font>

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">they did over at actually at the links</font>

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,179
and just generally a few months ago

47
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,340
actually doing some performance testing

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,530
of root servers and related to the

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,790
issues that have been seen particularly

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,790
in some of the bigger I axes

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,620
okay pinay she's lost her voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lost</font>

52
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:23,380
my voice exactly so I apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe</font>

53
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:24,700
not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak very clearly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

54
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so we're actually going to start</font>

55
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,839
out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of a general</font>

56
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,030
overview because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

57
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,300
people here actually know what a route

58
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,370
server is supposed to do or be because

59
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,290
this is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a topic actually</font>

60
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,489
important for internet exchanges at that

61
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,650
time where ya Chris and I both work at

62
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:47,200
internet exchanges so we've been busy

63
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,170
with this and so what we're going to do

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,060
is first tell you a little bit why do

65
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,488
people actually want route servers what

66
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,280
do they do and how are they useful to us

67
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,470
and and then a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little more on technical</font>

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,810
details what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to fulfill to</font>

69
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,780
actually make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and work in a</font>

70
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,870
fashion that that so they provide what

71
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,010
we what we want from them and then we're

72
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,130
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the interesting part</font>

73
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,260
where we're going to present<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

74
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,440
current open source implementations that

75
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:21,720
are out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that incorporate brought</font>

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,340
server functionalities three of them

77
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,329
yeah nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than those three</font>

78
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:32,489
actually and and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group that</font>

79
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:35,260
we've been active in so to speak that

80
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,299
was busy with testing those three

81
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,730
implementations and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

82
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:42,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they have their limits how they</font>

83
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,768
scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> or how how they function viewed a</font>

84
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:48,280
function and on that we're gonna have

85
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:51,130
some shiny graphs and test results and

86
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:55,230
things we've we've figured out at that

87
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start out why</font>

88
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,970
why do we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers so as I</font>

89
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,459
said internet exchanges appearing

90
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,049
platform where lots of parties

91
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,079
interconnect and want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appeal with</font>

92
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,260
each other and we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> them within the</font>

93
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,860
viewing platform

94
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,970
to make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier on people to actually</font>

95
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,690
exchanged the routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> with either with</font>

96
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,699
each other and the general issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

97
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,978
if you were are in an exchange point and

98
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:23,660
you have an open peering policy you want

99
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:26,449
to appear with as many parties as

100
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,729
possible which creates a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of overhead</font>

101
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:31,760
for you with maintaining all those

102
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:47,090
sessions configuring them all doing all

103
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:50,680
the ship to keep them up thank you you

104
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,679
get your talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mike when you talk</font>

105
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so what you can do with the route</font>

106
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:59,930
server is if it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a transparent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

107
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:03,138
note in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your platform</font>

108
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,660
basically and you set up one session to

109
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,460
it and it transparently forwards

110
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,169
everything that it receives<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that</font>

111
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,659
one session to every other party

112
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,940
connected so what you can do is you

113
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,880
reach a lot of parties with only one

114
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,880
session being at that exchange point it

115
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,250
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> helps you in cases like if you still</font>

116
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,530
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously you still probably want</font>

117
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have all your biggest peers under</font>

118
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">your control and directly it directly</font>

119
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,550
have sessions establish with them it

120
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,080
helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if that session dies for</font>

121
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,820
whatever reason you still have the route

122
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,690
server while you receive basically the

123
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,990
same prefixes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> two for redundancy</font>

124
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,520
purposes or in the other way around in

125
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,590
case the route server dies you still

126
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,419
have a direct session to another peer

127
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,580
that will still give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the same</font>

128
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,510
prefixes again so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

129
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:56,389
redundancy at<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange points or when</font>

130
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,909
when when you get in<font color="#E5E5E5"> into an internet</font>

131
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,199
exchange the first thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is</font>

132
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,120
set up a session for a route server

133
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,460
which will immediately give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

134
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,310
prefixes already and not take you all

135
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,750
that overhead of spending weeks on

136
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,390
emailing everyone telling them who I

137
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,120
with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like the</font>

138
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,780
global overview what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do with</font>

139
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,850
route<font color="#CCCCCC"> servers all clear so far everyone</font>

140
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:24,809
is typing away anyways so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite</font>

141
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:28,230
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so what do they do a</font>

142
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,570
little more details everyone here speaks

143
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,270
bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights so it basically it looks like</font>

144
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,370
PHP we receive normal updates now I

145
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have anything I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can point out here</font>

146
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:41,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I'm just gonna do I have something</font>

147
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:45,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">to point out here I'll just don't talk</font>

148
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:48,419
about it so so let's say we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a route</font>

149
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,360
server setup at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot one and now</font>

150
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:53,250
everyone sees where the IP addresses

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:07,050
where the packet that update went to

152
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:11,070
right oh I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do this school wait</font>

153
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:14,220
that doesn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we have a</font>

154
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:17,010
route server on 10 dot twenty-three dot

155
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,919
0 dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and we have another peer</font>

156
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:24,000
connected to it dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> five and another one</font>

157
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:27,180
but four and those both of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> sonia</font>

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and normal bgp update to the route</font>

159
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,340
server announcing their prefix and the

160
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:41,370
first case the dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> five sends me the</font>

161
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:45,390
route 22 dot 0 dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 and that somehow</font>

162
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:48,900
good slides and the dot 4 sends me down

163
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:51,810
here the route 22 dot 0 dot for its<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

164
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,989
24 so what the road server now does with

165
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,030
that it applies a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of filters</font>

166
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,610
because people still may want to decide

167
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,469
even though they can receive all those

168
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,690
prefixes from that one route server they

169
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,550
still may want to decide if they want

170
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,100
appear with a certain party or not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

171
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,600
can we can configure filters on what we

172
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,870
want to receive and who we want to

173
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">announce stuff too and after doing that</font>

174
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,850
it creates

175
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:25,969
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm and it performs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path</font>

176
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,520
selection puts in all the prefixes or

177
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:31,580
all the best paths into the rib for<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

178
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,929
thing up here why it has to do that for

179
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:39,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">each single peer is is related to the</font>

180
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:41,929
filtering so let's assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

181
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:45,050
person doesn't want to have routes from

182
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:47,479
one specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> ass but in the global best</font>

183
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,910
path selection that prefix would

184
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,100
actually show up as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best one going</font>

185
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">over a s that someone else may have</font>

186
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,920
blocked so the problem is in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal</font>

187
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,920
case he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not receive that prefix at</font>

188
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,599
all because we don't have at path yet so

189
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,780
he wouldn't get something like a second

190
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,730
choice or multiple choices so he

191
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't have he would be lost on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

192
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:14,060
one prefix completely so what route

193
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:16,430
servers do is they maintain a rib / /

194
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,079
Pierre they have connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do a best</font>

195
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,910
path selection for everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

196
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,460
taking into account their filtering

197
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:25,699
options and what they would like to

198
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:28,970
receive or not receive so we build a rip

199
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:31,490
for that pier and what we then do is the

200
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,910
routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> over basically forwards exactly</font>

201
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:38,630
the same route that it already received

202
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:40,520
to every single participant in our case

203
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,340
where we only have two<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers and two</font>

204
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:47,150
routes it would forward the route from

205
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:51,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">we previously received from dot 5 to the</font>

206
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:55,730
0 to 5 2 p.r 24 and it would forward the

207
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:58,699
220 for superior<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 taking into account</font>

208
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the route server itself is</font>

209
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,890
completely transparent so it does not

210
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">insert anything in today as path this is</font>

211
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,420
still exactly the same as it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font>

212
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,950
received and doesn't change any next

213
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,890
hops or anything anything it just

214
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:17,240
forwards it as it is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

215
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,140
down to all the other peers right<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

216
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,410
good

217
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:26,790
so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to visualize although</font>

218
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,469
this doesn't take into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

219
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually can have multiple local ribs</font>

220
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:34,740
here we get stumped from all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers</font>

221
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:37,800
we do our<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path selection we have</font>

222
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,589
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIP in in a proper route server case</font>

223
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,750
that actually has filtering included we

224
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:44,940
have multiple of those best path

225
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,750
selections and ribs and then it forwards

226
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:53,060
at all to the other peers<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected</font>

227
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:57,899
right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so currently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

228
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:03,290
all at least so far everyone has been

229
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:08,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">using quagga to to have a route server</font>

230
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:13,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">wagga has had some trouble say it like</font>

231
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:16,860
that where yeah it's basically not been

232
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:21,510
very well maintained lately and it had a

233
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:23,970
lot of issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a crushing box and</font>

234
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,189
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things Oh Chris knows a lot</font>

235
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,700
about that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was never designed to</font>

236
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:33,120
scale to what we're using it for today

237
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:36,779
yeah exactly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so then so then other</font>

238
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,700
options appeared which were so far or a

239
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:42,120
couple of years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were basically</font>

240
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:46,740
just open source implementations of BGP

241
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,510
speakers that didn't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all the</font>

242
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,760
capabilities that were that were needed

243
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a fully functional route server</font>

244
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,140
they had the transparency so they could

245
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">just forward everything to the other</font>

246
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,660
note what they didn't have was the

247
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,790
multiple ribs and with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you couldn't</font>

248
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,459
do any filtering on them so within the

249
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:08,219
last couple of years open bgp d and

250
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:11,699
birds who what<font color="#E5E5E5"> andre we'll talk about</font>

251
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,920
that some more later developed all those

252
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:16,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">features that are needed to to be run as</font>

253
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,719
a route server which put us into a spot

254
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,730
where we suddenly had three options to

255
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,060
choose from which one would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

256
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,620
use so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> those three and every</font>

257
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,199
internet exchange

258
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,570
well every lot of internet exchanges

259
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,610
started testing around and trying to

260
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,160
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be cool to use</font>

261
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,870
what what would be what scales what

262
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually functions what issues do they</font>

263
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,940
have or not and everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of started</font>

264
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:44,250
doing that on their own until at some

265
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,640
point we figured that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't really</font>

266
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:50,480
make any sense to all do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our own</font>

267
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:54,779
so we decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet up which is</font>

268
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:58,380
perfect yeah Willis in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

269
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:01,980
but he wasn't actually there yeah we

270
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,600
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let him come hang out yeah he</font>

271
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretended to be interested in route</font>

272
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:13,050
service to to go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for beers little</font>

273
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:16,140
silly so we organized this<font color="#E5E5E5"> week in</font>

274
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:19,709
London where<font color="#E5E5E5"> where Andy from Lana Chris</font>

275
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:23,189
from certain data myself more from links

276
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:26,430
who works<font color="#CCCCCC"> mike robert from plagues who's</font>

277
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:30,440
not here as a bastion from<font color="#E5E5E5"> d6 who's not</font>

278
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:34,680
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> either and both going from biggs</font>

279
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,470
met and we did an insane round off of

280
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,959
testing and I mean we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that that</font>

281
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting all your energy and forces</font>

282
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,729
together usually make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

283
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,740
you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more focused and into it</font>

284
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,050
and sitting there locked up with a group

285
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,029
of six seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> people without windows</font>

286
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,279
thanks Mike for providing the great

287
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:58,020
meeting room to us that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

288
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,820
to use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that week we played around</font>

289
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,040
and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what are the</font>

290
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:06,650
limits of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> boxes how far can we go</font>

291
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:10,020
what can we do with them and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

292
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:12,089
Chris you continue I've talked enough

293
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">are you sure yeah your voice told</font>

294
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:20,810
although it's coming back I'm voice is

295
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:20,810
coming back I'm shorter than she is

296
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:34,460
okay so so the week in London was was

297
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:37,190
really interesting this this week

298
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:40,070
launched is a switch and data official

299
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:42,290
launch for all of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> out servers and</font>

300
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,540
that trip for me was a big learning

301
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:49,370
experience as we were initially<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

302
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:54,079
deploy quagga and that doesn't work so

303
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:55,550
well but seriously all three of these

304
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,850
route servers have their advantages and

305
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,189
disadvantages if you when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get right</font>

306
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,330
down to it quagga will work for you if

307
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,040
you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a lot of routes</font>

308
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,350
if you don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ribs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

309
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,170
configuration is easy you know open beat

310
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,960
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp d has its advantages and quote</font>

311
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,719
and bird does as well I'll kind of walk

312
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:18,230
you through a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of this we use</font>

313
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,570
three labs in this testing as a lab in

314
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,640
palo alto for switching data we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

315
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:26,900
servers they're running freebsd and

316
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:29,750
linux we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> lab in no we didn't run</font>

317
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:34,130
open gifts me oh yeah we did no not not

318
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:37,460
no oh yeah we did sorry we ran two

319
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:39,980
openbsd boxes and for linux boxes are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24</font>

320
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,290
for freebsd buses to open vs need for

321
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:46,060
free via boxes and again all the birds

322
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:50,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and quagga stuff on freebsd you and</font>

323
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:53,060
correct and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> lo my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 people here</font>

324
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,829
anyway ya know from links had a couple

325
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,819
of oxes as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

326
00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:00,950
running linux and robert from<font color="#E5E5E5"> plex had</font>

327
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,290
several boxes and several routers and

328
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:06,680
his lab in<font color="#E5E5E5"> poland that we used as well</font>

329
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:13,280
we did a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the attribute testing</font>

330
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:17,000
with his systems so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted</font>

331
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,740
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if a s430 cubed asn was</font>

332
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,830
completely functional if it was

333
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,720
transparent in compatibility mode if it

334
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,459
worked in native mode and all three

335
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,379
versions do you support and

336
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:31,638
and through a variety of tests proved to

337
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:34,759
properly pass attributes if they were

338
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:39,170
running a non 32-bit asn or if they were

339
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:42,439
running 32-bit asn that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn did work</font>

340
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,240
properly on v6 this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">those ones where we were coming in that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">got to London and so we're really</font>

345
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,639
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to be v6</font>

346
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,639
problems especially with quagga we had

347
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,509
had heard reports that some of the bugs

348
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:06,199
that were fixed orange fixed properly

349
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:09,669
but when we tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all of them do</font>

350
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:12,140
support v6 natively supported well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

351
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:14,270
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> highly advise you if you're</font>

352
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:18,549
running pretty much any version whether

it's opened<font color="#E5E5E5"> be gpd quagga or burg to run</font>

the summer last year physics<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 36 um a special notice no</font>

361
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:48,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah are you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure ok you can have more</font>

362
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:51,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">time right but the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last bullet ports</font>

363
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:53,029
are definitely ill-advised because when

364
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,969
you when you get into the configuration

365
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:57,890
on of these guys there are configuration

366
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,100
tweaks in the config file that you may

367
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:03,370
not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make for your implementation</font>

368
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,959
the ports are not super duper good

369
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,639
scalability this is where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

370
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,630
start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

that we have here<font color="#CCCCCC"> will have 5 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

373
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,029
session set up from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Onyxia five hundred</font>

374
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:22,309
or a thousand prefixes and then we had

375
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:24,890
regenerated random flaps throughout the

376
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,240
evening and overnight while we were

377
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,890
doing overnight testing to see what

378
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,419
would happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we tried to generate as</font>

379
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,600
close to a lab condition where we could

380
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:36,690
get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> large-scale internet flap over a</font>

381
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,030
period of time

382
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,790
there's we also did additional testing

383
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:45,030
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to you know up to 10,000</font>

384
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:47,010
20,000 prefixes per session to see what

385
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,530
the scaling point where the memory

386
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,320
limitations were their memory bugs if

387
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,520
you went crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the number of routes</font>

388
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,500
that you were willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give to your</font>

389
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,660

390
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,100
quagga one of the things that when we

391
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,410
were heading<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> London that we really</font>

393
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,760
inherently performed better from our

394
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,260
initial looks at it because it has its

multi-threaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're clogged as a single</font>

396

process it has a session thread which

397
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,070
will keep your sessions alive and send

keep lives<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the route decision</font>

399
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,120
threat is running and I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that</font>

400
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,860
when we get to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP d but quagga is</font>

401
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,909
a single thread and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to</font>

402
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:32,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">have much scheduling in it so it really</font>

403
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,260
when you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of updates and a lot</font>

404
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:37,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">of sessions being created it you get</font>

405
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:40,980
race conditions where it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gone it</font>

406
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:45,080
it's a descending spiral of death once

407
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,580
once you get there there's there's

408
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,679
several bugs in this in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font>

409
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,919
that when you start to get into you a

410
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:57,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">decent amount of routes that would say</font>

411
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:59,850
10,000 or more and you inject flaps or

412
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,430
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even injecting all that many flaps</font>

413
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:06,600
if you just you know start creating more

414
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:09,150
sessions and the route decision aspect

415
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,459
of the the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts taking over it</font>

416
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,830
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're bugs that will</font>

417
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:19,500
just it runs away on the memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when</font>

418
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:24,500
you're done so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU graph of</font>

419
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:27,210

422
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,340
when it comes up it seems to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

423
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,190
get your updates from the from the

424
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:41,100
flapping and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just in the CPU just</font>

425
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,960
stays pegged other than it sometimes

426
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,559
calms down there's no real rhyme or

427
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,230
reason to this graph

428
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,928

00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:58,240
the time dropping other sessions while

while they're in it the spiral the

435
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,158
this is twice as many prefixes twice as

441
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,309
it only has two threads route decision

442
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:28,480
and sessions so they do get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

443
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:30,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">of advantage there but if you look at</font>

444
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,409
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU graph on this thing it's just</font>

night and day<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same flat patterns</font>

bgp he just sits there and yeah what do

448
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:47,679
you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me bird CPU kind of similar</font>

449
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:49,360
it consistent you'll see where the flaps

450
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,950
are generated he's take a cpu spike

451
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,498
where the flaps generated settles back

452
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,769
down and it just generally hide right

around there this<font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the open bgp d</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cpu the boxes were fairly close this</font>

455
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:05,408
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> is only 500 prefixes per session</font>

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:08,469
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> prefix the number of prefixes</font>

457
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:11,740
didn't radically affect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU of bird</font>

458
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:16,960

460
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,029
covered the open bgp d is multi-threaded

461
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:25,299
the session thread is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge advantage</font>

462
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:27,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">in in open bgp d it's in my humble</font>

463
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:29,499
opinion the strongest advantage for open

464
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:32,440
bgp d is is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't have</font>

465
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:34,330
to worry about your sessions which when

466
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,740
you get into quagga and you start losing

467
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,830
sessions because you don't have keep

468
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:41,169
alives anymore you get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a race</font>

470
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:45,100
open bgp d solves that by just keeping

471
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,678
the sessions up so you don't add

472
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:52,049
additional flapping because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

how big a route server you have right

for every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer you have if you</font>

actually have if you have like 200 peers

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> every one with its own rib imagine</font>

490
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,630
that that its routing table is basically

491
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,930
multiplied<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 times and it has to store</font>

492
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:46,690
that somewhere in memory and we've we've

493
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,670
seen situations where the memory usage

494
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:52,600
goes up really really quickly if you

495
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:55,120
start using multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> ribs and in terms</font>

496
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,399
of how we did our testing every peer

497
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,979
every session that was was in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exia</font>

498
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,800
had its own rib so in all these tests

499
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,390
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred ribs created and all</font>

500
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,080
the routes were advertised in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

501
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:11,020
each rib so it basically was a hundred

502
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,560
times a thousand times 100 in terms of

503
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:17,830
the hash that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to keep so it was it</font>

504
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,720
was a pretty intensive test<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I can't</font>

505
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,970
imagine a route server today that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

506
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:27,090
reach the limitations of an open<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d</font>

507
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:27,090
on i386 and certainly none on amd64

508
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:36,160
memory usage on open bgp d fairly

509
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,030
consistent for the thousand prefixes at

510
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">100 sessions it it just chunked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

511
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:44,290
along even in flapping it held its

512
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,240
memory pretty constant it didn't free it

513
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,820
super fast you can see a little bit of

514
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,150
jitter there but for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most part once</font>

515
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:55,240
it's up it's running it just stays

516
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,470
pretty constant quagga this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

517
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,550
where you can really start to see the

518
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,030
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between clogged and the</font>

519
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:02,800
others you get flaps you know it starts

520
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,720
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the memory then all of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden it</font>

521
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,139
frees a bunch of memory then it comes

522
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,930
back

523
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:12,190
good and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cycle of death and</font>

524
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:14,950
you're done so this is this is a pretty

525
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:17,470
typical quagga you saw the CPU graph

526
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:21,460
earlier you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> command pre grab this is</font>

527
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:23,260
this is what happens that's what fun um

528
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,570
the other thing that we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in choir</font>

529
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">just in our deployment as well outside</font>

530
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:30,730
of a test that in production is you just

531
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:32,919
slowly see memory leaking away their

532
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,140
other it there's obviously some dirty

533
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,330
dirty ends in the code where the just

overloaded with new sessions coming up

549
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:21,940
with flaps it'll deal with the routes

and slowly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surely bring more</font>

gets what it wants it holds it and it

580
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:43,959
doesn't release it it just sits there

581
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,029
that's it doesn't matter what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">questions after Andres presentation and</font>

00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:04,750
then maybe a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes for discussion</font>

00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:08,860
as well if we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got something before</font>

route watch your mixture mixture what

595
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:28,080
was your distribution like our

596
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:31,269
distribution basically we took and I

597
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:35,980
believe that we I broke it up is a

598
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:37,480
certain percentage of / AIT's a certain

599
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:41,470
percentage of / 16 is a certain

600
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:46,269
percentage of / 24 s and distributed it

601
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:47,769
across a range of space so I was trying

of routes the highest number of routes

609
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:09,309
we went to on each pier was about 50,000

610
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,830
and this was bird that that was bird the

611
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:13,418
the one catch<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say there is that</font>

612
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,309
when we were at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that many routes we</font>

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at that moment it's been</font>

615
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,070
that was in the first week of<font color="#CCCCCC"> december</font>

616
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,690
so i don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the test</font>

617
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:26,720
scenario we had but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

618
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,970
at one point we had bird up to somewhere

619
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,799
around a half million rounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

620
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">what was a memory to a primitive level</font>

621
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,439
yeah we only won one caveat on open<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

622
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:42,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">d we couldn't get that far on it but</font>

623
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was because i only had a AMD I 386</font>

625
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:51,259
amd64 boxes to test it on this curious

626
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:53,210
has to in the past when we've run route

627
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:57,320
servers we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get close to</font>

628
00:29:53,210 --> 00:30:01,879
100 years with at the time fault default

629
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:04,730
free feeds remember that we're running

630
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:07,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">100 ribs as well right right so I</font>

631
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:14,120
understand and we also were running a

632
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:16,490
rib purrpurr and I think the memory

633
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:22,239
usage<font color="#CCCCCC"> though at the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was running on</font>

635
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:30,049

636
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:33,830
these newer route servers implements

637
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:36,019
about scaling and lobsters although the

638
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:37,279
elite so much more memory one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

639
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:38,629
that's that's one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

640
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,029
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in our next round of testing</font>

641
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:45,230
is actually find out based on the the

642
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:48,470
distribution of types of route so length

643
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:51,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">of prefix and such as to exactly how</font>

644
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,509
much space each prefixes or if it

645
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,690
prefixes the previous of the prefix how

646
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:58,070
are they Howard power than the

647
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:01,070
implementations hashing that and then

648
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:06,080
storing it and determining kind of like

649
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:07,519
a miles per gallon a bicycle route so we

650
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,439
could see you know which was more

651
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,080
efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of we have a</font>

652
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,240
predictable pattern for if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

653
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have 200,000 routes on this route</font>

654

server this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how much memory you have</font>

655
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,509
if you plan on<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to 400,000 by five</font>

656
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">years this is how much memory you're</font>

657
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:25,100
going to need for that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would love</font>

658
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:26,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to have that a little bit</font>

more

granular data and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual data as to</font>

661
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:37,800
how that's implemented but I we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ran</font>

662
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:39,210
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time just a comment I want to say</font>

663
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,649
on the free memory thing don't worry

664
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that too much you won't free it</font>

665
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:44,730
until something else requests right so

666
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,140
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason was in freeing this</font>

667
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,640
because nothing else needed it you want

668
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,490
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the scanner e we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email</font>

669

boundary like the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can we test it</font>

670
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,640
he's like that don't worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

671
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:58,560
you'll see it on solaris with other

672
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:00,120
stuff were you redoing the extra

673
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,070
processing of inbound rod filtering

674
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,360
making sure you know any other

675
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,570
processing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that packet or was it just</font>

676
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">accept all rats no we didn't we did not</font>

677
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:13,050
do any filter testing on that I don't

678
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:15,540
yes we did communities on that community

679
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,310
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we didn't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

680
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,780
we didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the filtering the</font>

681
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:23,120
last day we were going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

682
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,120
prefix filtering and we ran out of time

683
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:31,680
basically you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> six geeks into a Roman</font>

684
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:33,210
it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but everything we</font>

685
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,280
wanted five days and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you get</font>

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything we did it we need to be</font>

687
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,700
needed a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> more weeks to get</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">everything that that we really wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

689
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:44,960
get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them it was it was</font>

690
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting thanks Mike for hosting us</font>

anybody else have any questions cool

692
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:56,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so it does no further questions</font>

708
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:48,800
that's a reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking out the root</font>

709
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:51,290
server software well I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure if</font>

710
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,419
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> having here to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some company</font>

711
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:56,300
introduction but just just very briefly

712
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:58,400
I didn't prepare any slides Susanna is

713
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:02,180
as I said it's a theory operator we are

714
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:05,300
very active in in DNS SEC that more

715
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:08,600
importantly we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have we are involved in</font>

716
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:12,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">many projects are driven by Internet</font>

717
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:17,060
community and they may be related to DNS

718
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:20,178
SEC to DNS at all or also to ISP and I

719
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:22,759
XP business we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are hosting also some</font>

720
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:29,000
events related to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet community</font>

721
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:32,960
maybe some of you attended ITF meeting

722
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,940
in prac right was in 2007 and maybe some

723
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,090
of you who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in European a</font>

724
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:40,639
first plans to happen to attend a right

725
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:45,800
meeting and I think in two months in

726
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:52,820
prac so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are welcome but big back to</font>

727
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:55,550
write back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to berk the Oh Chris and</font>

728
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:58,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">ELISA talk a lot about the roots of a</font>

729
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:01,100
part i will introduce birth from scratch

730
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,089
so how it sorted what what are the main

731
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:07,348
features because it's common

732
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:10,290
rooting them on project it's not just

733
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:12,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">directed focus in route service so</font>

734
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:15,869
although you probably didn't know the

735
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,000
project it's quite old it started at the

736
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:21,390
end of the last century so it will

737
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,730
became a teenager<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon it started as a</font>

738
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:28,379
school project at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the charles university</font>

739
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:32,520
it's up almost 700 years medieval

743
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:42,000
finished the school<font color="#CCCCCC"> project we could</font>

744
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:45,150
create and we stopped contributing in

745
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:50,099
that so we we didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

746
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">while so the project slept and with some</font>

747
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:56,130
small exceptions when when I saw that

748
00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:01,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is something broken and needs to</font>

749
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:03,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">be fixed but it became fully active by</font>

750
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:05,970
the end of two thousand eight when it

751
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">became part of the season Eclipse</font>

more projects mainly related to DNS SEC

755
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:24,780
that this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key projects of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> laboratories that time and please</font>

757
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:32,670
remember it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1999 we set up some</font>

758
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:34,558
goals basically in simple words to have

759
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:38,069
the best internet reaching them all in

760
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:41,549
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and that times it seemed to be</font>

761
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:45,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">very easy because quagga was just in the</font>

762
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:49,700
beginning what we wanted to focus was

763
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:52,530
efficiency so we wanted to have a some

764
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:56,339
software or some routing them on that is

765
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:59,730
small tiny that is very efficient that

766
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:03,089
can be run on also devices with limited

767
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:08,290
resources we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have portable and</font>

768
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:10,860
module Damon so you you are able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font>

769
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:14,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and other routing protocols easily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font>

770
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:18,190
we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support current routing</font>

771
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:21,640
protocols at that time and one thing

772
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:23,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we put into the design and which</font>

773
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,240
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little bit minute strange is</font>

774
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:28,020
that we wrote that<font color="#E5E5E5"> code in that way that</font>

775
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">we wrote both ipv4 and ipv6</font>

776
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:34,270
implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance so it means that</font>

777
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:37,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have an ipv4 demone you</font>

778
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:40,330
just compile it if you want to have ipv6

779
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:42,549
Devon support that supports ipv6 you

780
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:47,650
compile it with compile option enable

781
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:52,240
ipv6 so it ipv4 and ipv6 implementation

782
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:54,010
is in a single source code so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

783
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,319
the current status or what the main

784
00:37:54,010 --> 00:38:01,690
feature does it have now it's very

785
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:04,900
portable but honestly the only operating

786
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:08,410
system that people requested for linux

787
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:11,320
and all variants of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ESDS its supposed</font>

788
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:13,240
idea for<font color="#E5E5E5"> acoustics of course of course</font>

789
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:17,530
it supports static routing how

790
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:21,069
surprising<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then all the three major</font>

791
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:23,770
major routing protocols probably not

792
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:27,970
very you sleep but in all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> variants</font>

793
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:32,500
in version 2 and next<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation we have</font>

794
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:37,569
both OS PS version to version 3 and of

795
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:39,790
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp as a some more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> features that</font>

796
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:42,160
are related to those protocols but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i bet</font>

797
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:49,090
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you can watch the web pages</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to go for further details it deployments</font>

799
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:56,110
BGP route reflector and what its most

800
00:38:52,810 --> 00:39:00,430
important for this this track is the

801
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:03,990
root server we support 32-bit essence

802
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:09,160
and md5 authentication and many other

803
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:10,930
bgp related things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also you can you</font>

messages you're receiving and cetera

806
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:20,890
what may be different from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the others a</font>

visa of multiple routing tables multiple

808
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:27,819
ribs that in a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> different way than</font>

809
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:30,819
the others you can also synchronize

810
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:35,109
those routing tables with operating

813
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:42,450
that supports multi routing tables you

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> synchronize them independently with</font>

817
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,779
pipe it's a protocol design to

818
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:58,990
interconnect to routing tables and some

819
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:01,839
so that those two routing tables became

820
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:08,379
synchronized but some filters may be

821
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:12,759
applied in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> process that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

828
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:34,689
how you want to synchronize the routing

829
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:35,859
tables among those those protocols we

830
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,990
believe we have very powerful

831
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:41,848
configuration although it's probably

832
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:46,029
pretty different from the current ones

833
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:49,839
it a little bit looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a programming</font>

834
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:53,970
language we have very<font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful filter in</font>

835
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:57,060
which I will discuss that<font color="#E5E5E5"> father later</font>

836
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:59,520
and we have a common line interface

837
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,890
that's probably also not jerking to that

838
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,150
the problem is the configuration the way

839
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:08,040
it's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be set up or changed</font>

840
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:12,200
and on command line so the command line

841

goes through a configuration file it is

853
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to find differences between the new</font>

854
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:51,270
and old version and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> in turn figures</font>

855
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:53,520
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parts that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been</font>

856
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:56,099
changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for example if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you add a</font>

857
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,540
protocol it just starts a new protocol

858
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it doesn't affect the other</font>

859
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:02,790
instances etc so even if it's it's not

860
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:05,759
country group from command line it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

861
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:08,670
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to see the differences and</font>

862
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:13,880
automatically just study the effective

863
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:17,910
instances of routing protocols so that's

864
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,800
our simples came out how work can be

865
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,720
configured and but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said the</font>

866
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:27,210
possibilities are<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost unlimited in</font>

867
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:31,560
that perfect this is a for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example a</font>

868
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:33,780
typical routine demo as can be for

869
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:38,220
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> quag out very easily configured</font>

870
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,440
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP ospf some static routes in</font>

871
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,359
that that everything is connected to a

872
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,609
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table and then in</font>

873
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:47,848
synchronized to Colonel two operating

874
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:51,810
systems routing table the difference

875
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:54,510
what can be done by by<font color="#E5E5E5"> bird is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

876
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:56,670
add also the pride protocol so you can

877
00:42:54,510 --> 00:43:00,080
have a separate routing table with a

878
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:03,570
separate instances of

879
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:06,090
routing protocols and those can be

880
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:09,210
somehow synchronized and you can build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

881
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:13,170
very complicated network inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the</font>

882
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:15,750
single-bird process so that's that's

883
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:17,700
something that makes a bird very

884
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,980
configurable and you know all those

885
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,790
stages you can see you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply filters</font>

886
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:27,830
somehow so now how the configuration

887
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:30,300
looks what's the philosophy it has

888
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:33,779
multiple sections but there is no fixed

889
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,430
order in what you have to configure it

890
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,560
that of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you there are some</font>

891
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:41,160
comments related general to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> diamond</font>

892
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:44,190
like word do send the locks with the

893
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:48,060
route ID yet cetera there are some some

894
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:50,640
protocol sections that defines instances

895
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:55,009
of various protocol and it's like his

896
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:58,379
example of static routing and and bgp

897
00:43:55,010 --> 00:44:01,950
and there are also filters which can be

898
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:04,710
freely written everywhere and as you see

899
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:06,899
the the filter language<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really looks</font>

900
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a programming language so you can</font>

901
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:12,390
have if then statements statements you

902
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:16,140
have you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have case we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not support</font>

903
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:22,319
cycles but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the language of the</font>

904
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:25,940
configuration is really broad enrich the

905
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:30,180
command-line interface as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said it's</font>

906
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:33,600
not probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> very complicated some a lot</font>

907
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:36,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">of show commands you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can list protocols</font>

908
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:41,400
show the<font color="#CCCCCC"> status of the daemon</font>

909
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:44,308
and so on you can of course list the

910
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,470
routing table important thing the

911
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:49,769
routing table is able to not just carry

912
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:53,368
the most optimal route but a lot of

913
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:57,538
others which is widely used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in food</font>

914
00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:58,890
service again probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you as a</font>

915
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:04,769
networking guys nothing nothing

916
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:08,009
surprising you can list the routing

917
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:09,390
table all you can you can list specific

918
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:11,970
routing table as I said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

919
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:15,598
more of them you can list specific

920
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:18,868
protocols that what would routes it

921
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:21,779
added to the routing table and there is

922
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:24,960
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more you can look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

923
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:33,630
route for a specific IP number so you

924
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:38,160
see what what route applies to such to

925
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:41,309
such IP number you can also look to the

926
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,799
routing table and apply some filter

927
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:46,859
that's very handy especially if you look

928
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:48,299
for some specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> info information very</font>

929
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:51,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">often so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can in configuration</font>

930
00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:55,288
<font color="#CCCCCC">predefine your own filter and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

931
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:59,038
can use that filter for looking into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

932
00:45:55,289 --> 00:46:00,809
routing table another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you can</font>

933
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,109
look at the roots that are exported to

934
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:05,940
some protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the last two lines</font>

935
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:08,690
there are two examples they do the same

936
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:12,299
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's just to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you how</font>

937
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:14,940
complicated maybe and complicated also

938
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:16,499
means powerful in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case how powerful</font>

939
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:20,489
maybe the command line if you want to

940
00:46:16,499 --> 00:46:23,189
look for some information so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font>

941
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:27,749
what routes include the specific IP

942
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:29,999
number which is this line is a little

943
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:31,709
bit simple that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

944
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:35,368
complicated which is the last line so

945
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:37,670
you can you can write<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole language</font>

946
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:40,099
who filters into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the command</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line two</font>

947
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:44,569
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to pick up some specific</font>

948
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:46,040
information you need and now a little

949
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:48,680
bit style is the roots travelpod but

950
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:52,520
it's still about Burke generally that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

951
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:56,569
prepared an example of a filter that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

952
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:58,849
widely used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in root servers on the</font>

953
00:46:56,569 --> 00:47:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">screen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see the root server</font>

954
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:03,020
police say that this is specifically

955
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:05,540
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> nicks is it about the park</font>

956
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:08,180
internet exchange but it generally this

957
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:13,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the canon of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best practice for</font>

958
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:17,390
for many IXPs so by sending communities

959
00:47:13,309 --> 00:47:20,480
bgp communities you signal to what peers

960
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:24,680
you want to export<font color="#E5E5E5"> your router so or not</font>

961
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:27,290
so probably you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that scheme in your</font>

962
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,029
internet exchange and if you want to

963
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:31,430
configure configure or if you want to

964
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:34,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply this routing policy to for example</font>

965
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:36,740
quagga it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> low configuration with</font>

966
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:39,829
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines because you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to type</font>

967
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:42,709
specific line for<font color="#CCCCCC"> of specific lines for</font>

968
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:46,400
for every bgp instance for every bgp

969
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">peer that implementation in very is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

970
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,190
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we have a very as i said</font>

971
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:54,140
rich filtering language so the

972
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:57,410
implementation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy is just</font>

973
00:47:54,140 --> 00:48:00,618
those eight lines in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

974
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:04,819
part the rest is just another<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

975
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:07,549
instance so we we may use defines which

976
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:09,890
is nice you don't have to repeat all

977
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:12,079
numbers that you are later not not vary

978
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,000
with what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are from and more</font>

979
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:18,530
importantly we can use variables in

980
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:21,740
filters or in functions so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font>

981
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:25,059
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP instance just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cause that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

982
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:27,770
function and then it directly knows and

983
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:30,890
applied as a filter so it decides

984
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:35,900
whether the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route is exported</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to another</font>

985
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:38,839
instance or not so let's to to see the

986
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:43,040
powerful of all the filters and other

987
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:44,480
good thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> viana we don't have just</font>

988
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,420
compressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

989
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,750
of two values we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

990
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,880
member of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set or member of a member of</font>

991
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:55,369
a set and it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or set of</font>

992
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,790
prefixes it can be a set of all

993
00:48:55,369 --> 00:49:01,520
tournament systems so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example this</font>

994
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:05,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how to avoid some networks you</font>

995
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:08,000
probably don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to import and the</font>

996
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:09,799
beauty of the configuration and the

997
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,530
beauty of that this approach is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

998
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:15,200
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not line by line configuration but</font>

999
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:17,210
we can compile it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance so from</font>

1000
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:22,549
this set of prefixes we built a binary

1001
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:24,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">tree so the computing complexity of that</font>

1002
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:28,790
filter is not linear as in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

1003
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:30,500
demons like quagga or open bgp but its

1004
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:32,630
its logo it makes so it's much faster

1005
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:35,270
especially if you have very large set of

1006
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:37,400
s numbers or prefixes you want to filter

1007
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:41,600
so that's very handy especially for good

1008
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:43,910
service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> net</font>

1009
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,069
statement the same the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> for eyes</font>

1010
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:49,460
numbers just in with the difference that

1011
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:51,140
you can also have ranges of numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1012
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,960
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if it's really useful for in</font>

1013
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:57,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">that case but there's also one</font>

1014
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:02,180
possibility and again we built a binary

1015
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:05,000
tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the search time in such lists is</font>

1016
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:08,540
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast and the computing</font>

1017
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,950
capacity is very very low and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

1018
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:12,320
they are root servers and there are

1019
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:15,279
peers that have thousands of affairs

1020
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:19,000
numbers and and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs filter them</font>

1021
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:22,310
precisely so that's that's handy and

1022
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,640
another and last example from the filter

1023
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:28,940
language is the case statement this

1024
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually looks at the originator of the</font>

1025
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:37,430
optimum of the root who is the last in

1026
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:40,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP path and again and again it's</font>

1027
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:44,210
also implemented by binary search tree

1028
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:47,000
so it's also very fast and this is very

1029
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:50,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for example if you very precisely</font>

1030
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,740
filter<font color="#CCCCCC"> s number and its prefixes you</font>

1031
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:53,580
want to control<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everything was</font>

1032
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:57,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">written in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roots</font>

1033
00:50:53,580 --> 00:51:01,100
database is also announced by bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1034
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:03,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">some ixp do this and without without the</font>

1035
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,759
minorities it would take a lot of

1036
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:08,190
computing power on the root server and

1037
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:13,200
it takes a lot of computing with quagga

1038
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:17,720
for example so now what let's switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1039
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:21,480
the root servers I prepared for you out

1040
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:24,750
some so for skin how a root server may

1041
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,160
look with birth it's I say may because

1042
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:30,810
some some people use different

1043
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:33,450
approaches but this is how the majority

1044
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:36,330
of IX please look at the configuration

1045
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:38,910
of food source of vicksburg so what do

1046
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:40,620
you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the picture is that you have</font>

1047
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:43,710
a routing tables that are the blue

1048
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:46,950
circles sorry routing tables look blue

1049
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:50,640
circles for every a s number every

1050
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:54,359
pairing s number as these s number may

1051
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:59,400
have more more<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pierce more and more IP</font>

1052
00:51:54,360 --> 00:52:02,220
addresses those how to help the green I

1053
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:05,750
don't know the green stuff they are

1054
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:09,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">connected all to a single routing table</font>

1055
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:11,850
we don't apply filters on at that stage

1056
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:14,880
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see exactly what those people are</font>

1057
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:16,680
sending us but those routing tables

1058
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,960
develop those local routing tables are

1059
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:21,540
connected by five protocols to the

1060
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">master routing table and then the whole</font>

1061
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">furthering is supplied</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the pipe</font>

1062
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:33,509
protocols in the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know it's</font>

1063
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:36,600
purple red color term things so you see

1064
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:39,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything but it's announced to you you</font>

1065
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:43,259
filter just just those prefixes that are

1066
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:47,970
all pay according to the described

1067
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:51,210
policy in the in the database are a DB

1068
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:53,669
or whatever you wills and in the master

1069
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:56,520
table then you apply again exporting

1070
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:59,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">filters so you expose everything back to</font>

1071
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:02,630
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the routing tables so that</font>

1072
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:06,369
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this number of is numbers you</font>

1073
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:09,940
either the memory consumption for every

1074
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:13,130
44 every number but on the other hand

1075
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:14,900
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> full control what is announcing</font>

1076
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:21,349
what is everybody announcing to you you

1077
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:23,599
see what routes are comes to the master

1078
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:26,329
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> would are exported back by applying</font>

1079
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:28,400
the the routing policy aside this

1080
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:33,430
product later so this is typical scheme

1081
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:36,920
how how this is built and now to the

1082
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:39,680
concrete implementation the first

1083
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,200
implementation of birth is as a root

1084
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:45,640
server was done at lone up<font color="#E5E5E5"> those guys</font>

1085
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:50,868
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very brave and helped us a lot with</font>

1086
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:56,000
with debugging or with adding some some

1087
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:59,690
features that are necessary for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for root</font>

1088
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,900
server they aspinal they run to road

1089
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:07,400
service one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bert and 1's open bgp d</font>

1090
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:09,349
and they run it for I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 100</font>

1091
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,799
1000 prefixes dead days I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

1092
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:15,349
what's the current status but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1093
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:18,559
recommend and this is I think something

1094
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:20,720
I usually recommend you know every

1095
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,660
software as a boxer don't run stages

1096
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,269
with one root server you should have at

1097
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:28,690
least you and it's handy and it's good

1098
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:32,660
if you can have multiple implementations

1099
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:34,549
because if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> just two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

1100
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:38,269
same ones they usually crash at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

1101
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:45,099
moment that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very helpful the</font>

1102
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:50,808
second implementation was ethnic<font color="#CCCCCC"> sees it</font>

1103
00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:53,960
surprisingly the setup is the same we

1104
00:54:50,809 --> 00:55:00,049
run burton linux and and quagga<font color="#E5E5E5"> quagga</font>

1105
00:54:53,960 --> 00:55:01,609
on freebsd our experience is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1106
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:04,800
extensive experience is the personal

1107
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:08,370
Britt's not crashing since the release

1108
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:12,300
we have approximately 6,000 I've if you

1109
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:14,940
pray ipv4 prefixes and the memory

1110
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:22,230
consumption is quite low much much lower

1111
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:24,240
than quagga another one this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1112
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:27,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">different so that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm picking it</font>

1113
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:32,160
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fix the Vienna internet exchange</font>

1114
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:36,330
they also use bird but they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1115
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,640
have a little bit maybe strange or

1116
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:41,580
what's a different schema of the pie

1117
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,730
protocols as maybe you remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

1118
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:46,650
every bgp instant is connected to some

1119
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:48,420
local routing table and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

1120
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:50,880
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PI protocol to master</font>

1121
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:52,890
routing table what weeks does is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1122
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,680
they use PI protocol for connecting

1123
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:59,819
every routing table with each other so

1124
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,980
they have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and n times n PI</font>

1125
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:04,350
protocols in wolf in that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a</font>

1126
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:07,380
possibility as i said the it's free

1127
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:10,100
Maduro and configurable so you can you

1128
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:13,050
can do whatever you want with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1129
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:16,170
seems to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for them and they</font>

1130
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:24,030
have currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 12 peers in the</font>

1132
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:31,380
started last month and after were long

1133
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:33,379
and careful testing they replaced

<font color="#E5E5E5">quacker with birth and</font>

1135
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:38,730
as far i understood the messages from

1136
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:47,570
the end it seems to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> satisfied with</font>

1137
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:53,150
that they have a about 40,000 ipv4

1140
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:04,020
I say they do a lot of testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> better i</font>

1141
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:07,110
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the presentation that the</font>

1142
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:13,320
crease<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know is that it's quite useless</font>

1143
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:16,110
to show you those grass as it will set

1144
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:18,480
brought is free let's say conservative

1145
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:22,410
in the memory consumption it consumes

1146
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,810
just really needed memory however but no

1147
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:28,350
it's almost never released the memory

1148
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:32,190
the idea is that if it's a routing them

1149
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:34,560
or a root server it probably will if you

1150
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:37,770
have enough memory so why don't why not

1151
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:40,290
consume it and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably need it</font>

1152
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:44,250
next time for example if just some some

1153
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:46,830
appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> pipes and it's not very good to</font>

1154
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:48,270
release memory and then take it back for

1155
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:51,170
the stability is much better to cook

1156
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:56,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">those memory and be ready for reusing it</font>

1157
00:57:51,170 --> 00:58:01,770
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how memory consumption looks</font>

it's a it's wednesday morning european

1204
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:44,170
them I did some we did some small test

1205
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:46,839
but we were quite careful

1206
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:48,700
doing those because it's much much

1207
01:00:46,839 --> 01:00:53,619
better if some<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party people do</font>

1208
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:56,200
testing instead of you so we just

1209
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:59,260
prepared a simple test about the memory

1210
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:02,618
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU consumption in earnest in a</font>

1212
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:08,470
whole bgp table and that's also we

1213
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:11,650
measured the memory consumption and the

1215
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:19,510

1216
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:22,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">cpu time was we tested quagga and open</font>

1218
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:27,460
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> fair because certain bgp d is</font>

1219
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:31,450
not really designed to run on<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux so</font>

1220
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:34,809
it may have some problems we did two

1221
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:38,549
tests first one was to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> ups a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">truther</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with synchronization with the</font>

1224
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:47,439
open bgp didn't work in that scenario

1225
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:51,549
because as I said it's it's not linux

1226
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:54,849
focus project so we couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it but</font>

1227
01:01:51,549 --> 01:01:57,040
anyway from it was a simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> test but you</font>

1228
01:01:54,849 --> 01:01:59,410
can see the memory consumption is I

1229
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:03,040
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know six times small compared to</font>

one of the daemon one of the process and

1237
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:29,790
as you see the memory consumption of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP d process remains almost the same</font>

1240
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:39,069

01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:41,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">is no reason to change but of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">CPU time because we</font>

1243
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:47,439
didn't have to synchronize with with

1245

1249
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:14,740
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not recommend using a very</font>

old OPPD version on a Linux system I

1251
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:22,600
agree they made so many changes to that

01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:29,310
though yeah i'm close to 3m so the

<font color="#CCCCCC">bye-bye more and more exchange points</font>

you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see with you about monthly races</font>

1258
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:45,160
we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on some</font>

improvements in ospf like or paralysis

1260

and such stuff because bird is used by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

we are very open to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> de su</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> marine</font>

1279
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:49,130
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> broad has</font>

1280
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:52,060
awful and configuration filter language

1281
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:56,510
it's lightweight and very efficient

1282
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:59,990
routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> lemon it's developed by people</font>

1283
01:04:56,510 --> 01:05:04,370
from the isp community and we hope that

1284
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:05,930
we can say we are quite active one

1285
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:08,480
problem is that we have unusual

1286
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:10,970
configuration language but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it may be you</font>

1287
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,130
understand now why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really necessary</font>

1288
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:16,490
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to do very efficient</font>

1289
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:18,410
filtering maybe we are still missing

1290
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:21,500
some feature for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we never</font>

1292
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:28,700
protocols one thing that may be strange

1293
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:34,040
for you is that separation of ipv4 and

1294
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:35,660
ipv6 instances and last<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put a question</font>

1295
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:39,230
mark there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that single threat</font>

1296
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:40,759
application but really instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1297
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:43,910
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> more single or multi</font>

1298
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:46,220
threat it's better to stop testing look

1299
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:49,129
at the performance of the diamond and

1300
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:52,279
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will see that there is no real</font>

1301
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:54,710
need for for multi-threading because the

1302
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:57,250
performance that movie<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 may add to the</font>

1303
01:05:54,710 --> 01:06:01,250
design that broad has is a little bit

1304
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:02,780
it's a question actually so because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1305
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:05,030
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement a lot of walking</font>

1306
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:07,790
and other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't do in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1307
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:10,520
single threat and maybe the gain of of

1308
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:12,710
that wouldn't be so that's so nice so

1309
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:14,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all if you need some more</font>

they have a dedicated team working i

awesome john kemp for reviews one issue

1322
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:58,210
we have is when we're riding out ribs so

1323
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,930
every two hours we dumped the entire rib

1324
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:04,420
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wondered if that was ever looked</font>

bird you mean you explore the routing

1327
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:16,660
table we write it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the</font>

1328
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:18,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">best way is to what's come together and</font>

try that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1331
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">could could we have in that the routing</font>

1332
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:34,200
table export or if you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1333
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:36,850
export routing table to do disc is done

1334
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:38,950
it just takes the CPU time that is not

1335
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:41,710
used by the routing instances so it

1336
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:45,250
shouldn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know make the system</font>

1337
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:46,810
slower it should work really probably

1338
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:50,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best ways to try and we will see</font>

1339
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:54,670
what issues we can have with it and one

1340
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:59,140
general question for feedback for the

1341
01:07:54,670 --> 01:08:02,320
quagga people what is the programming

1342

method you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you think gives</font>

1343
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:06,370
you the better performance than quagga<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1344
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:09,130
sort of understand how they're doing

1345
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:11,500
their threading and they give access to

1346
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:14,860
a thread and that thread can just hold

1347
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:17,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu i assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys are doing</font>

1348
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:20,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's more event-driven yes</font>

1349
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly you know in a route server</font>

1352
01:08:25,299 --> 01:08:30,609
and in general in quagga it's not it's

1353
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:33,609
not only just that you have event<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU</font>

1354
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:34,810
issues that drive the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU you also have</font>

1367
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:08,109
efficient I think the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference is</font>

01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:10,150
the design we've are not tied with any

completely different<font color="#CCCCCC"> I and also to do</font>

1373
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:24,609
even I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> every routing lemon has to</font>

1374
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:26,800
be even driven because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there are no</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's really no much work to do this</font>

1377
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:35,858
as a routing them on so you anyway wait

1378
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:40,510
for some some external events or events

1379
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:42,490
caused by timers but yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all and</font>

1380
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,950
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I make make a comment on that as</font>

1381
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:48,279
well just from our experience with<font color="#CCCCCC"> quoc</font>

01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:27,949
upon what you're doing to use the route

1416
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:31,839
servers as a way to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> your user</font>

1417
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:34,009
community for instance one thing we

1418
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:39,250
provide it was the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monitor</font>

1419
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:42,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">appearance sessions for all the peers ok</font>

1420
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:44,660
switch and data are our implementation

1421
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:47,120
is completely automated so you don't

1422
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:49,309
actually have our people logging into

1423
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:51,219
the route service themselves we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1424
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:54,380
provisioning database that maintains the

1425
01:11:51,219 --> 01:11:56,210
ASAS set and IP address for all the

1426
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:58,219
customers when they want to activate

01:11:56,210 --> 01:12:00,770
their relative recession the email the

1428

1430
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:07,880
they plug the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS set in it goes out walk</font>

1431
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:10,669
cir gets all the routes thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> razz for</font>

1432
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:13,310
that by the way gift all the routes we

1433
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:15,890
build a prefix list /<font color="#CCCCCC"> pierre and set the</font>

1434
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:17,220
session up as a passive session so are

1435
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:22,700
you configuring my medical

1436
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:25,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we we update we update every every</font>

1437
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:30,240
route servers config about every five

1438
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:33,000
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow yeah so same pretty much</font>

1439
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:35,250
same forensics we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a database in</font>

1440
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,480
which we basically just take he wants to

1441
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,070
appear with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route server and it</font>

1442
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:42,719
catches all the data out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the database</font>

1443
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:45,420
and we get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s set for the filtering</font>

1444
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:50,120
we base our filtering on import export

1445
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:52,830
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> assets and it catches that</font>

1446
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:56,880
automatically for a newly added here and

1447
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:58,740
then it readers at every six hours for

1448
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:02,040
basically filtering changes or something

1449
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:05,190
like that might have happened and for

1450
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:07,920
the burger<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bird developer um I'm</font>

1451
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:09,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry or the operators what tools are</font>

1452
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,270
you using to generate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> birds and</font>

1453
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:16,080
shakes we we wrote our own scripts in

1454
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:18,030
house to do that in my opinion there's

1455
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,590
not really a good in for bird in

1456
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:21,570
particular there's not really a good

1457
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:23,250
automated config generator you're pretty

1458
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:27,240
much going to have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

1459
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:30,000
we only<font color="#E5E5E5"> use prefix lists and some some</font>

1460
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:32,490
exchanges use prefix list and

1461
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,960
communities some only<font color="#E5E5E5"> use communities so</font>

1462
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:35,490
it's really going to be specific to the

1463
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,650
way that you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and how you're</font>

1464
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:39,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking you're seeing like it the Vics</font>

1465
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:41,280
they do the way that they do ribs is

1466
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:43,830
different than the way that am-6 does

1467
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:45,090
ribs and we only use one rib so when you

1468
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:47,190
get into that and you're starting to

1469
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:49,050
pipe between different tables and such

1470
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:51,780
the config is going to be radically

1471
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,890
different for each exchange the biggest

1472
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:55,200
can think we were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about earlier</font>

1473
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:56,490
was about 4 Meg's our biggest one at

1474
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,800
switching data is about it I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1475
01:13:56,490 --> 01:14:01,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">to half Oh actually it's be good to 11</font>

1476
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,320
mix<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 night</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1477
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:07,200
size changes significantly and you get

1478
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:09,570
in one second you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1479
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,880
get into configs that are this large on

1480
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,769
such a wide deployment there's no way

1481
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,630
that you can do this manually absolutely

1482
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:17,220
not it has to be automated and it all

1483
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:17,679
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do your filtering in</font>

1484
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,300
the end

1485
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,159
configuring a couple of neighbors that's

1486
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,749
a couple of lines and it's all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

1487
01:14:21,159 --> 01:14:25,749
all the time and if you have the IP

1488
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:29,050
address somewhere you can write<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

1489
01:14:25,749 --> 01:14:30,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">reliance right so the filtering thing is</font>

1490
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:33,070
the thing that matters the most for

1491
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:36,670
automation and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do any prefix</font>

1492
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:38,079
ill during we only filter on which<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SS</font>

1493
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:42,340
people would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to import and export</font>

1494
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:45,268
ooh so our conflict is very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I</font>

1495
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:47,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wonder there's no general 24 for</font>

1496
01:14:45,269 --> 01:14:49,829
making the configuration I know that

1497
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:53,679
every ixp has its homegrown system

1498
01:14:49,829 --> 01:14:55,570
usually some parallel another scripting

1499
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:58,659
language that takes care of that and

1500
01:14:55,570 --> 01:15:00,400
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually taken from the rule one</font>

1501
01:14:58,659 --> 01:15:03,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing database like right DB you are a</font>

1502
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:06,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">DV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and such the flexibility that birds</font>

1503
01:15:03,639 --> 01:15:10,809
configuration language<font color="#E5E5E5"> leet offers leads</font>

1504
01:15:06,999 --> 01:15:13,420
to widespread configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> variance</font>

1505
01:15:10,809 --> 01:15:16,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">where clog is very Cisco like you're</font>

1506
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:19,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">very fixed style of configuration it's</font>

1507
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:21,549
easier to generate configs from a tool

1508
01:15:19,719 --> 01:15:23,349
we're in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> language you have so many</font>

1509
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:25,739
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have you know you have</font>

1510
01:15:23,349 --> 01:15:28,269
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ribs and pipes and and</font>

01:15:25,739 --> 01:15:32,919
communities<font color="#E5E5E5"> no communities pre fits no</font>

1512
01:15:28,269 --> 01:15:35,530
prefix if you took the let's say 8i XPS

1513
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:37,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know they're either using bird or</font>

1514
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:39,280
going towards bird and you looked at

1515
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:41,438
their config every one of them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1516
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:46,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be probably significantly different</font>

1517
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:48,189
from every other one just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my</font>

1518
01:15:46,449 --> 01:15:49,839
links points of view yeah we generate

1519
01:15:48,189 --> 01:15:52,719
all that config with our own homegrown

1520
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,820
scripts that are basically quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> tightly</font>

1521
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:58,869
integrated with our backend provisioning

1522
01:15:54,820 --> 01:16:00,159
database as well so we didn't when it

1523
01:15:58,869 --> 01:16:02,860
was written it was rented to a job

1524
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:05,978
rather than to be portable so it's not

1525
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:09,369
been written to be abstracted into other

1526
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:11,139
environment yeah we had mixed use it if

1527
01:16:09,369 --> 01:16:14,380
i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak on behalf on except we</font>

1528
01:16:11,139 --> 01:16:16,479
generate also configs based on the

1529
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:19,059
prefix layers and layers number is and

1530
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:21,579
we do it automatically every I don't

1531
01:16:19,059 --> 01:16:23,979
know had six hours

1532
01:16:21,579 --> 01:16:26,789
and for those distance rappers are

1533
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:31,780
looking to possibly run route servers

1534
01:16:26,789 --> 01:16:34,959
may want more shows a<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking solution</font>

1535
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:36,789
have you thought about talking to where

1536
01:16:34,959 --> 01:16:39,760
we spin in some of the efforts that were

1537
01:16:36,789 --> 01:16:43,030
done with our virtual set for instance I

1538
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:45,099
mean when we ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob servers of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Merit we</font>

1539
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:47,079
used a are a tool set which became my

1540
01:16:45,099 --> 01:16:49,719
virtual set and get our automatic

1541
01:16:47,079 --> 01:16:52,259
configs that way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously I said</font>

1542
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:56,229
both configuration is much more

1543
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:59,679
sophisticated and flexible however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

1544
01:16:56,229 --> 01:17:02,530
imagine that there might be some freak

1545
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:04,209
and a solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be at least</font>

1546
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:06,129
available for those who want to quickly

1547
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:08,349
start up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get a rough suburban I i</font>

1548
01:17:06,129 --> 01:17:12,010
would offer you two suggestions in that

1549
01:17:08,349 --> 01:17:14,079
there are things out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron hughes</font>

1550
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:17,469
rights has written a great peering tool

1551
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:21,549
that we use pieces of that as part of

1552
01:17:17,469 --> 01:17:25,329
our glue I our PT is great we've put

1553
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:27,070
that to generate v4 prefix lists so yeah

1554
01:17:25,329 --> 01:17:29,259
there are canned stuff that goes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1555
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:31,478
but once you get down to your your base

1556
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:33,099
implementation when we really started

1557
01:17:31,479 --> 01:17:35,260
looking seriously at rolling bird

1558
01:17:33,099 --> 01:17:38,679
honestly the other IXPs were our best

1559
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:41,109

1604
01:19:41,619 --> 01:19:46,749
I would prefer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that but kind of</font>

1605
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:51,760
curious how your customers are seeing

1606
01:19:46,749 --> 01:19:54,130
math and honestly I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1607
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,900

1608
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:57,219
do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same as you prefer my private</font>

1609
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:59,978
connection to them and then use the

1610
01:19:57,219 --> 01:20:02,079
route server as a backup and it

1611
01:19:59,979 --> 01:20:05,079
transparently forwards everything else

1612
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:07,900
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to set any prefs or</font>

1613
01:20:05,079 --> 01:20:09,579
something on it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can basically set</font>

1614
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:13,690
it up as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for which one you</font>

1615
01:20:09,579 --> 01:20:15,308
would like to choose first I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

1616
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:17,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">a quick comment about how people doing</font>

1617
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:20,619
the path selection where they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

1618
01:20:17,289 --> 01:20:22,690
piano<font color="#CCCCCC"> in place they tend to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just have</font>

1619
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:25,360
direct peering over that pni and local

1620
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:27,518
preference learned via that that tends

1621
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,589
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a common common hack to go and do</font>

1622
01:20:27,519 --> 01:20:30,949
that so rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to work it</font>

1623
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:33,019
out of the root servers

1624
01:20:30,949 --> 01:20:34,728
obviously you wouldn't in theory you

1625
01:20:33,019 --> 01:20:38,119
anything that you learn over the root

1626
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:39,679
servers should have a next top on the

1627
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:42,860
shared medium as well it shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1628
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:45,050
a next top somewhere else yeah correct

1629
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:47,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just we've had some</font>

1630
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:48,619
conversations internally where it's you

1631
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:51,499
know it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice they have the two</font>

1632
01:20:48,619 --> 01:20:52,999
paths that's just do we you know do we

1633
01:20:51,499 --> 01:20:55,039
choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a dedicated path and then</font>

1634
01:20:52,999 --> 01:20:56,510
on the reverse path how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we control</font>

1635
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:58,518
that person<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other side where we</font>

1636
01:20:56,510 --> 01:21:04,369
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily you known their router</font>

1637
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:07,070
do we do adding additional you know

1638
01:21:04,369 --> 01:21:08,478
prepend to a route server or or what

1639
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:10,820
have you and have you actually

1640
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:13,639
considered just slapping a pretent on

1641
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:15,829
everybody coming in with their a s on

1642
01:21:13,639 --> 01:21:17,690
the inbound would that address the issue

1643
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:19,699
globally without having to make any

1644
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:21,409
special configs for all the customers i

1645
01:21:19,699 --> 01:21:24,619
would i<font color="#CCCCCC"> would think that exchanges that</font>

1646
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:26,539
except communities that you you know you

1647
01:21:24,619 --> 01:21:28,070
if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they allow you to change</font>

1648
01:21:26,539 --> 01:21:30,380
local proof that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would now that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

1649
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:32,420
work I you could just<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no export</font>

1650
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:35,090

1653
01:21:39,469 --> 01:21:44,479
like motivational now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this isn't</font>

1654
01:21:41,869 --> 01:21:46,130
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new problem you know we</font>

1655
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:48,380
certainly in London we have lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1656
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:49,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">people with multiple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions and it on</font>

1657
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:51,619
the roots there on the root servers

1658
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:54,289
there are cables they've got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

1659
01:21:51,619 --> 01:21:56,179
stuff and battery local preference is

1660
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:59,539
kind of generally too big a hammer for

1661
01:21:56,179 --> 01:22:03,110
this kind of manipulation people do or

1662
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:04,579
complicate things yeah it's caused a lot

1663
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:07,989
of problems as well if you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

1664
01:22:04,579 --> 01:22:07,989
at interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

1665
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:17,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we've had a bit the discussion</font>

1666
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,470
as well there so we're going to say do

1667
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:20,570
you want any more general discussion I

1668
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:22,820
think we've kind of had that and and I

1669
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:24,230
keep seeing lots of comments on IRC that

1670
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:26,299
people keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying smelled barbecue</font>

1671
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:30,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">which kind of means the food might be</font>

1683
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:09,050
