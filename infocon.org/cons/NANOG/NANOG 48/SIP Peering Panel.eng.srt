00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:11,040
good morning everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> my name is Sonia</font>

2
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,710
sakovich<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm with sprint on the peering</font>

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,299
coordinator the panel we're going to do

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,369
next is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIP peering panel discussing</font>

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,560
operational experiences from various

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,720
perspectives you don't have to tell you

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,130
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> came down here this morning and you</font>

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,419
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's here a little bit early and I</font>

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,788
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the hallway</font>

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,560
outside and I noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these people</font>

11
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,530
in suits walking down toward the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,410
end of the the the way there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,719
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I you know was in the Seinfeld</font>

14
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,309
bizarro world of nanog because all these

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,020
people who were<font color="#CCCCCC"> in suits and everything</font>

16
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,849
just wouldn't be this group that were

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,620
that was here so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually part</font>

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,000
of a different conference so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt a</font>

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,660
lot more comfortable when I saw people

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,039
in normal tire start walking around so

21
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:57,569
anyway so I've been hearing coordinated

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,390
with sprint for about a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:05,729
months and back in the fall I had a

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,010
request come to me for peering for voice

25
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,729
bearing which I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't familiar</font>

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,340
with and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as everyone tells me</font>

27
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,960
those sprint standard response is always

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,250
when someone else you're preparing

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,720
anybody know what that is well usually

30
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nell's first time around that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,780
they tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise so I brought the</font>

32
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,270
request over to my associate ye who is

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,960
involved in sip invoice peering for

34
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,039
sprint and he filled me in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,140
on the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what it's all</font>

56
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,620
know in preparing this pic for this

57
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,920
panel i was reviewing a network a

58
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,810
network world article in a December

59
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,849
issue which discussed some of the

60
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:47,150
predictions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 2009 for voice and ni p</font>

61
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:49,099
as well as some of the results and i

62
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,019
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of those</font>

63
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:54,768
predictions and results that either came

64
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:56,810
true<font color="#CCCCCC"> or didn't and one was that 4g apps</font>

65
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:59,299
were supposed to be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big but</font>

66
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,840
apparently they weren't very<font color="#E5E5E5"> big in 2009</font>

67
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:04,250
another one was that infrastructure

68
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,280
suppliers were going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus less on</font>

69
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,810
innovation and more in execution with an

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,739
emphasis being on the user experience

71
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that really did happen and as these</font>

72

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,108
their stories how they match up with

74
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,299
some of these predictions or not and

75
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:22,310
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going to list a couple</font>

76
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,590
of the 2010 predictions that were in the

77
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,720
network world article it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually</font>

79
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,250
convergence and voice VoIP alert that's

80
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,540
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> article was and we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

81
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask some questions and open it up for</font>

82
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,099
discussion so with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll bring it</font>

with until appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're an enhanced</font>

95
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,819
voice application service provider our

96
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,539
core business is the wholesale<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry two</font>

97
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,539
carrier type things

98
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,960
so

99
00:05:47,610 --> 00:06:03,180
pardoning so the brief history down sip

100
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:03,180
is a application you can read this slide

101
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,679
sorry thank you

102
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:33,810
so within sip you've got various Network

103
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:36,060
elements the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI you know uniform</font>

104
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:40,910
resource indicator<font color="#CCCCCC"> Universal resources</font>

105
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,910
and hitter user agent

106
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:08,050
so here to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what keeps us up</font>

107
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:15,250
at night things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a sip operator I</font>

108
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:19,500
have to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a daily basis so</font>

109
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:23,830
there's zip standards and various

110
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:27,400
interpretations of their standards like

111
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:31,120
a lot of protocols you know proprietary

112
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:36,820
things are good for the vendor who wrote

113
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:39,550
it for me it leads to lots of

114
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:45,550
interesting issues between different

115
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:47,800
vendors it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder between to do</font>

116
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:54,550
multiple vendors then you know it

117
00:07:47,800 --> 00:08:01,110
probably should be for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the way</font>

118
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:01,110
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sonus you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customize the DTMF</font>

119
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:08,230
type and the codec for you know

120
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:11,830
individual service profiles and the

121
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:18,910
sonus you can't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other vendors</font>

122
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:20,380
so you know it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreed to details</font>

123
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,990
when you're turning up when you're

124
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">testing and retesting and the the</font>

125
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:30,250
interop is really quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> time-consuming</font>

126
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:33,449
and it often still doesn't work the

127
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,679
testing trunk group will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> configured</font>

128
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:41,320
different than the production trunk

129
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:44,189
group and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it leads to having to</font>

130
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:49,420
sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at the traffic and</font>

131
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:53,230
decide Oh chief they<font color="#E5E5E5"> change something or</font>

132
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,349
we change something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now it doesn't</font>

133
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,350
work

134
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:10,310
you know and going between codex is

135
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:16,620
really quite resource-intensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> G 729</font>

136
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:19,699
lots of short calls makes it really hard

137
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,700
on the switch

138
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:37,990
so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep all running right some</font>

139
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:49,810
tools buy some tools rewrite by some

140
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:51,760
other tools yelled as it says it on my

141
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,680
network it's kind of a hodgepodge we've

142
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,060
got different things looking at

143
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">different pieces and you know sometimes</font>

144
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:04,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">they work together sometimes they don't</font>

145
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">I unfortunately don't have an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

146
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:15,480
the CDR but it's I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I think 60</font>

147
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:21,940
fields<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comma</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> separated value</font>

148
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:24,640
pretty ugly upgrading between various

149
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,260
room you know upgrading from one patch

150
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,180
release to another one major release

151
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:34,990
will sometimes change the value of some

152
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:39,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the fields so rewriting and then</font>

153
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,720
figuring out so this IP events caused

154
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,230
this voice event or did this voice

155
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:52,210
events like the correlation between is

156
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:56,200
quite difficult sometimes certain tools

157
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:58,930
will focus well on you know certain

158
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:03,160
parts of it but they have no visibility

159
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:08,040
or there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way of getting visibility</font>

160
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,040
into another part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it with that tool</font>

161
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,930
and then you have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

162
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,430
looking at the tools so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

163
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:27,790
voice people<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the voice stuff</font>

164
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:31,209
and the IP people understand you know

165
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:33,339
the infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure</font>

166
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:40,870
out who's responsible and who to talk to

167
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:44,950
and how to talk to them has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been an</font>

168
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:49,530
interesting challenge because sure it's

169
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:51,760
a night the application but you know

170
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,280
someone who understands what each of

171
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:59,830
those 60 different fields and the the

172
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:02,130
CDR means to me it isn't as interesting

173
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,130
but

174
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:14,450
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the odd things when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I started</font>

175
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:19,610
was chasing down some intermittent

176
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:22,670
packet loss you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a very very</font>

177
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:28,430
small percentage and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past it</font>

178
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:33,439
wouldn't have mattered but the the way

179
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:37,609
our network then nerve or network

180
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:43,910
hardware allocated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cues didn't work</font>

181
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:49,100
quite the way that the traffic mix need

182
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:50,420
it so running<font color="#E5E5E5"> around in circles trying</font>

183
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:57,920
to figure out you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

184
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:59,630
problem is this really a problem so have

185
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work very closely with the vendors</font>

186
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:07,150
each time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go through an upgrade make</font>

187
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the log formats are the same</font>

188
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,050
several log knowing projects to try and

189
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">improve the correlation between the</font>

190
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,140
voice events and the IP events and

191
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:23,600
standardizing the the communication

192
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:25,160
making it a language or figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

193
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,820
language that you know each group can

194
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:35,870
understand writing things down rewriting

195
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:37,640
them educating testing more testing you

196
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,440
know we're a small company but we've

197
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen a lot of growth in the past couple</font>

198
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:47,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">of years so one of the big projects has</font>

199
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:50,420
been to move out of our small you know

200
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:59,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple cabinet type space into some</font>

201
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:59,199
larger dedicated cages and you know it

202
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,990
yeah sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get this life so I'm</font>

203
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,490
sure a lot of you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been through</font>

204
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:15,370
migrations unfortunately it hasn't quite

205
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:19,050
as easy as just you know flipping one

206
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:21,759
switch off and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one on yeah we</font>

207
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:32,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build until but it's expensive</font>

208
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:34,240
and time-consuming so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last one and</font>

209
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:35,709
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> few are going to be a little</font>

210
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:42,300
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of building till and a little bit of</font>

211
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:42,300
just it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of coordinated mayhem</font>

212
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:59,440
so as a small provider you know going

213
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,000
and talking to larger providers and

214
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,959
saying hey do you want to peer do you

215
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:12,130
want to exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> us if it's a really</font>

216
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:16,599
different paradigm the the old PSTN

217
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,959
voice paradigm is a lot of most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

218
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:24,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">co-workers come from that background and</font>

219
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:30,130
the you know sip application IP doesn't

220
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:32,500
really make sense in terms of you know

221
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:37,029
why should we peer vs let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just turn up</font>

222
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:42,009
another circuit and you know some of the

223
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:44,920
larger people that we work with they

224
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:47,560
won't be paid for the circuit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

225
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:57,279
minutes so it gets to be kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

226
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:58,719
expensive expensive proposition so one

227
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,019
of the things I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on is</font>

228
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,120
trying to educate both people within my

229
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:10,540
company and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the people that they</font>

230
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:14,949
talk to figure out you know does peering

231
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:19,349
as you know the ISP thinks of it makes

232
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:19,349
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> or or dots</font>

233
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:36,569
questions come in flames can probably

234
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">hold the questions</font>

235
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:53,880
you're saying

236
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:56,610
I do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one comment aunt acapella 45</font>

237
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,310
minus data<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting here in Seamus's look</font>

238
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:03,180
a lot like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> IFC with a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

239
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">interop problems I just I'm and I'm</font>

240
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:10,740
naive and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know why sip is more</font>

241
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:13,679
interesting than standard I sup MTP

242
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever that we already have I don't</font>

243
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to know what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> word is sip come</font>

244
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:27,780
into the game for already is kind of an

245
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:30,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">IFC operation but I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sip is</font>

246
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,690
basically an ss7 signaling replacement

247
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,250
and i'm using sip on top of an IP

248
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,110
network allows you to use a commercial

249
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">network you know i'm a dedicated TDM</font>

250
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,280
based ss7 based network that's running

251
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,650
in parallel to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your IP</font>

252
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,080
network said you can throw voice on top

253
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:50,130
of an IP network basically operating as

254
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,620
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> application simply new especially for</font>

255
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,750
inter carrier signal right I think we're

256
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,719
kind of maturing through that process

257
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:00,450
right now vendors are maturing through

258
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,070
that process and ultimately you know

259
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,500
sipped<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop i think is a little</font>

260
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,678
easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> than it is today but we have to</font>

261
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:12,900
we have to cut our teeth<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

262
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you for your comment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so my</font>

263
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,760
name is Tim codeine from from new star

264
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,990
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about enum and more</font>

265
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,309
specifically against number<font color="#E5E5E5"> portability</font>

266
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,390
and how you route services over IP so

267
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing is really how does this</font>

268
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,840
concept called carry you know work

269
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,850
there's different flavors of e nom

270
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,570
there's a concept called public enum

271
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,918
which really hasn't gone anywhere what

272
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,540
we're seeing that it really started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

273
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,030
take off as a concept called carrier you

274
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,760
know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the effectively the</font>

275
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,100
carrier that owns a telephone number

276
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:47,970
around the world will populate the data

277
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,949
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a registry very much like DNS too</font>

278
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,860
babe effectively associate telephone

279
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:55,220
numbers with services over IP so to make

280

<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work you need a kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a tier 0</font>

registry

282
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,590
and right now there's a couple of them

283
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,889
out there but the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

285
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,870
the GSA which is the kind of the Trade

286

Organization for the gsm carriers it

287
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:12,449
represents I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of billion</font>

telephone numbers around the world today

289
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:18,430
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of where the tier 0</font>

00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,960
concept called tier 1 and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where</font>

292
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,450
could be different countries regulatory

293
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">bodies get involved and state and this</font>

294
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,650
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the tier 1 registry for</font>

295
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,900
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> country in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States we've</font>

296
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,940
got a couple of registries that that are

297
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,980
still we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out what</font>

298
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,190
which one's going to do what one is

299
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,050
called cc1 enum and<font color="#CCCCCC"> another is called</font>

300
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,020
the impact a number portability database

301
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:45,070
which actually is used to route

302
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,230
telephone calls voice calls today with

303
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,179
portability and then lastly you've got

304
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,140
the tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 registry and this is where</font>

305
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,190
your actual route information could be

306
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,950
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the issues you've got to</font>

307
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got to worry about is based upon</font>

308
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,570
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a complete discussion not</font>

309
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,280
for here but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've seen with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pierre</font>

310
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">ii is it's not necessarily a technical</font>

311
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,510
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think technically as Josh</font>

312
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,159
mentioned there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop problems or</font>

313
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,960
those kind of things but what we really

314
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,110
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the issue is is on the</font>

315
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,870
business side voice has a hundred year

316
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,189
legacy for good or bad and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

317
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,070
of issues with intercarrier compensation

318
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:23,800
that kind of thing so carriers may or

319
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,600
may not want to expose routes to other

320
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,580
carriers they may say you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

321
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,469
want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to receive instant</font>

322
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,720
messaging traffic from this carrier or

323
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,610
this survivor so what the tier<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

324
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,680
registries do is they apply policy and

325
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:40,270
let you decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> who you're going to make</font>

326
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,860
your routes available to as mentioned

327
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,090
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> number portability is a big big</font>

328
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal because one of the things behind</font>

329
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,340
enum<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the RFC in case anybody</font>

330
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,190
doesn't know is RFC 37 61 is kind of the

331
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:54,459
overarching RFC but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

332
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:57,250
people with enum is based on telephone

333
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,170
numbers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your to get back to use</font>

334
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,059
multiple IP addresses with certainly

335
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">service routes attached to them</font>

336
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:05,110
there's billions of telephone numbers

337
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:06,850
today amazingly we actually have a

338
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,340
standard for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this e dot one sixty four</font>

339
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,748
that everybody in the world agrees to so

340
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,309
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to reinvent the wheel</font>

341
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:14,769
and come up with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> different standard</font>

342
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,879
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> user name enum kind of uses the</font>

343
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:18,610
assumption that the telephone number

344
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:20,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user name so today number</font>

345
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,449
portability has been implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 55</font>

346
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,700
countries every solution is different

347
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,940
and they generally sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> are costly</font>

348
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:30,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">a complex and costly to deliver traffic</font>

349
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,559
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a of an example of</font>

350
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:34,029
this global inconsistencies so you've

351
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,070
kind of got a number record holder a

352
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:38,200
number holder and so if I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a call</font>

353
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,428
we're i'm going to originate and utterly

354
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,610
care how originated the call whether

355
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:44,470
it's TDM IP whatever i'm going to go

356
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,049
through an international carrier hub to

357
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,269
get it to the other side<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

358
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:51,369
recipient is you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

359
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:53,259
down at the bottom but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to have</font>

360
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:56,199
to go through the number range holder to

361
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:57,789
get to the recipient so just use an

362
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,429
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the united states if i wanted</font>

363
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:03,009
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a call the number holder</font>

364
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:05,860
original number holder was AT&T but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

365
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:07,119
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that call to verizon that's</font>

366
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,729
who actually the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of imported from</font>

367
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,320
AT&T to<font color="#CCCCCC"> verizon well if i don't use a</font>

368
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,269
number portability database i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

369
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,139
send that call to AT&T and then 18t is

370
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:16,450
going to have to forward it on to

371
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:18,129
verizon and what's going to happen is 18

372
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,830
he's going to charge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> verizon's going</font>

373
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:23,408
to charge so it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more effective if</font>

374
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,178
you knew up front where the destination

375
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:26,830
was if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew the destination was</font>

376
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,960
verizon you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it directly to</font>

377
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,820
them and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why these number</font>

378
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,429
portability databases are important even

379
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,960
in IP world because it gets really

380
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:38,619
tricky an IP world where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could have</font>

381
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,789
multiple services attached to a sequel

382
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:42,490
telephone number and these services

383
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:44,440
could spread across multiple service

384
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,879
providers or carriers so i could have

385
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,529
instant messaging with google i could

386
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:49,629
have voice with verizon I could have

387
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:51,249
video with comcast I could have you know

388
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:53,080
I'd have by presence information from

389
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:55,960
another carrier and so how am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

390
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,259
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to another user especially with</font>

391
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">my numbers porting around so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

392
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:02,590
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> example kind of talk to this</font>

393
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:04,960
with routing challenges so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm an</font>

394
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,490
originating carrier depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on where</font>

395
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,980
i'm sitting the call to or the

396
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:11,889
communication session i may use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

397
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,340
different hub to get there based upon my

398
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:16,049
business relationships

399
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:20,129
so in this example if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sending it to</font>

400
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:21,658
two carriers a or b I need to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

401
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,399
a certain hub and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if i don't know</font>

402
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the number has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been ported to a</font>

403
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:26,610
different carrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> i may send it through</font>

404
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,140
the wrong hub provider call may not get

405
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,340
there or the session may not get there

406
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:35,970
or it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there but it's pretty</font>

407
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive so transition phase you know</font>

408
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,370
the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> portability obvious that's</font>

409
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,529
very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this data in one</font>

410
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:45,479
spot and today is typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> accessed</font>

411
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:47,309
using ss7 or c7 overseas and there's

412
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,200
there's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 55 countries</font>

413
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:51,178
around the world so you definitely don't

414
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,580
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go and do business with 55</font>

415
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,510
different countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

416
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,939
interesting rules about how you get

417
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,559
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that data so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gsma is</font>

418
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,690
trying to do is aggregate this data into

419
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">one spot so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it's number</font>

420
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,049
portability data for France or England

421
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:07,260
or Spain or Portugal or the United

422
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:10,260
States or Brazil or wherever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is put</font>

423
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,320
that one spot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then as IP routes get</font>

424
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:16,440
populated these registries for whatever

425
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,230
service you may envision SMS<font color="#E5E5E5"> MMS voice</font>

426
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,140
video I am whatever you put these<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

427
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,850
single spot so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a single dip so</font>

428
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,860
you do one query using enum<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

429
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">get back multiple routes and then you</font>

430
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,889

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:34,860
destination or that service so some

432
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:37,049
operational issues we've seen one thing

433
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,750
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen is is a lack of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

434
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:43,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">Haiti this is a very TDM term a lack of</font>

435
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:45,210
a class for IP network carriers do not

436
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,649
that there's a constant n squared

437
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,570
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> carriers do not want to do</font>

438
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:51,209
bilateral agreements with every other

439
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,740
carrier on earth they would prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

440
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,510
have certain number of bilateral

441
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,100
agreements based upon in strategic of

442
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,850
businesses but they would ultimately

443
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:03,149
like to be able to route traffic to one

444
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,740
or several class<font color="#CCCCCC"> four networks and let</font>

445
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:06,418
them take care of getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic to</font>

446
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,710
where it needs to go so that's one of

447
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we see number portability which</font>

448
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:12,750
I've really talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about usage of</font>

449
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:16,500
existing routing voice routing databases

450
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,360
so today for for text messaging or mms

451
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,820
we download content recent picture to

452
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,370
somebody today those applications use

453
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,570
the voice routing databases so in the

454
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">United States they use a thing called</font>

455
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,700
alert

456
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,039
and they use something called the impact

457
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,409
a report ability database to find out

458
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,600
where this owns a telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number and</font>

459
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:36,570
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route the problem with</font>

460
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is these databases were designed</font>

461
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:41,760
for routing information called<font color="#CCCCCC"> lrn and</font>

462
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">lr in has nothing to do with voice or</font>

463
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,559
estimate or SMS or mms so they route off

464
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,779
a thing called a spit it's basically a

465
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,270
carrier ID and says I want to route this

466
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:53,220
to AT&T this is a tease carrier ID

467
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:56,100
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I'm what about it the problem</font>

468
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,159
is carrier IDs not always accurate for

469
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:01,110
many reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> carriers may acquire</font>

470
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,640
another carrier they may do do certain

471
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,678
things so there's a variety of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

472
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,840
things and then lastly need a single

473
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,270
authoritative registry kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like you</font>

474
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,389
know I can to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this</font>

475
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:14,700
information in one spot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

476
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of quick ones with registers you</font>

477
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,690
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to control your inbound</font>

478
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:21,990
traffic so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you can go and change</font>

479
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,309
IP addresses so so carrier queries your

480
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,649
telephone number today they route into

481
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:27,210
one to one IP address you go change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

482
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:28,439
in registry all your period partners

483
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,820
will automatically get that data and

484
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,210
then they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> route to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your new IP</font>

485
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:35,309
address different routes for different

486
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,470
service providers so you may want to say

487
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,840
for my voice routes I want to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

488
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,390
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to appear with AT&T or verizon or</font>

489
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,949
sprint with my IM routes I don't want to

490
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,750
pair with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google for voice by doing up</font>

491
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,399
here with him for I am so they can get

492
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">different routes based upon on who's</font>

493
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:54,389
making the query SMS to wireline cares

494
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:55,408
is this is a big deal wireline carriers

495
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,880
want to be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> offer texting</font>

496
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:59,730
services but like I said they use these

497
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,039
public databases today and by definition

498
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:05,429
wireless service providers will not send

499
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,870
a SMS to a wireline provider so you need

500
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:08,039
a way to override that data and that's

501
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,918
where these registries come into place

502
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,980
as well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just as soon as you can</font>

503
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:16,110
see this how it works SMS operates<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

504
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,419
mms is next hop routing there is no

505
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,010
direct<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairing between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say AT&T</font>

506
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and Verizon today and it probably will</font>

507
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,908
not be any direct peering for that

508
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,010
services with them and then just summary

509
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,690
you know enum is a technology to<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

510
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,149
this data whether it's number

511

portability data or services over IP

512
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:34,489
routing information and that's all I had

513
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:44,950
does anybody have any questions right

514
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:47,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">now or do you want to wait spin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

hi my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt Krause problem with</font>

517
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,490
comcast cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> international engineering</font>

00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:01,510
technical operations organization for

519
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,970
about the last three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font>

520
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:07,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">really focused on sip interconnects and</font>

521
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:09,400
exchanging voice traffic i'm using sips

522
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:12,880
or comcast is built out our

523
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:15,640
infrastructure sip and using enum

524
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,289
protocol for phone call routing we built

525
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,419
that out internally used it for on at

526
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:22,929
traffic and now our you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know pushing it</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> intercarrier voice traffic exchange</font>

528
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:27,610
so touch on four points today the value

529
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:29,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">behind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> voice pairing you know why it's</font>

531
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,000
architecture will go through you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know an</font>

532
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,980
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that shows kind of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">interworking between sip and bgp and</font>

534
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:42,280
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick slide on some tools that</font>

00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,100
comcast is using so value behind voice

<font color="#CCCCCC">appearing um you know it's somewhat</font>

537
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">self-evident i guess but that they</font>

really exchanging traffic with another

<font color="#E5E5E5">carrier there are a lot of Tim mentioned</font>

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,870
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the intercarrier compensation</font>

541

545
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:09,159
day and agent and honestly a lot more

546
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:11,230
complicated than<font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to be so like</font>

547
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:13,450
changing traffic with a trusted pier

548
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,179
when you have a balanced traffic to

549
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:18,480
exchange then you know it's beneficial

550
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:20,740
to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct relationship and</font>

551
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,679
ultimately you're removing expense from

00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,470
your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> so using sip and bgp you</font>

553
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,789
know what enables that to happen so

554
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:31,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to some more background on</font>

555
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:33,070
on why you know this it's meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

556
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:35,500
condoms show how complicated it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but</font>

557
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,870
we have all these legacy rate elements

line from the intercarrier compensation

561
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:49,780
regime the you know the these terms had

562
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,700
value but in today's day and age the

563
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,020
technology is different really that the

564
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,570
access networks are different things

00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">just you know they don't mean the same</font>

from raiding<font color="#CCCCCC"> building compensation</font>

charging each other the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same amount and</font>

potentially even who to<font color="#CCCCCC"> dispute a bill</font>

578
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,840
with right you end up you know wasting

579
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,790
all that energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your net revenue</font>

580
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,689
associated to to the whole process<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

581
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero there's also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cannon providers</font>

582
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,290
involved in the situation and as transit

583
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:38,840
providers they definitely provide value

584
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,580
but if you have the right sweet spot

585
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,919
with appear where you have a lot of

586
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,320
traffic then it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to go to</font>

587
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,750
them so how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who would appear</font>

588
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,030
with Tim mentioned number portability

589
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,410
and at least in North America it's very

590
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,030
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to account for a number</font>

591
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,790
portability correction so you want to

592
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:58,730
look at where your minutes are going and

593
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:02,180
these are you know area codes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> PN X X</font>

594
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:05,120
exchanges<font color="#E5E5E5"> are corrected for number</font>

595
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:08,120
portability and track your minutes by by

596
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,969
destination so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Comcast's case this</font>

597
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:14,179
the shows are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chart here on the rise</font>

598
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:18,290
our distribution of our top not top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 98%</font>

599
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:21,560

600
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:23,540

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">only 63 different voice providers in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

603
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,290
United States you can find from

604
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:32,330
appearing perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> we find you know</font>

605
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:34,129
what your sweet spot is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many minutes</font>

606
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,050
you're sending you know to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers</font>

607
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:39,560
and that's who you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

608
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:41,930
approaching some cases the technology

609
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,060
may not be in place<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the prospective</font>

610
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,010
pair so so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a challenge from that</font>

611
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,620
perspective other you may have

612
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,060
disagreements on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the agreement</font>

613
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,000
you know that you know share the same

614
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,679
vision but you know you have top talk

615
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,050
through those issues with the

616
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,520
prospective peers and then you know

617
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:01,100
approach them with the technical

618
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,560
solution so in Comcast's case i think

619
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 75 to 90 percent of our</font>

620
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,000
minutes is it was real we're approaching

621
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,740
it and the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long tailed</font>

622
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,990
distribution you know we're more than

623
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,880
happy to work with transit providers to

624
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,210
get the

625
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,480
minutes where they need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how</font>

626
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,640
does comcast do it we have you know

627
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,490
comcast is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cable company so we have a</font>

628
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:27,010
packet cable based voice network as you

629
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,540
know access to our customer butts

630
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:32,320
appearing can work with any type of

631
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:34,780
provider wireline wireless cable etc so

632
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,899
are our network on on the left there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

633
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,820
specific to an MSO environment where

634
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,530
we've added the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routed voice routing</font>

635
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,840
intelligence is really in the middle

636
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,480
this this facility we have called it as

637
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,100
an ape a pop as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> application point of</font>

638
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,930
presence it's a pop for all of our

639
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,510
application servers so we have an

640
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:54,520
intelligent<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing database there with</font>

641
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,050
a sipper out proxy and our session

642
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,850
border controller so session border

643
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:00,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">controller is kind of like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a voice</font>

644
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,830
firewall provides topology hiding

645
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:05,110
features so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't have to</font>

646
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,639
advertise<font color="#E5E5E5"> out all of our customer IP</font>

647
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:11,379
address space we only have to advertise

648
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:14,890
out on SBC IP address space so it helps

649
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:18,580
protect us from you know those attacks

650
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,050
we aggregate<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling and media through</font>

651
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,610
the session border controller so it

652
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,460
provides you know the protection

653
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:26,469
function from there the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cipa proxy is</font>

654
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,090
somewhat is kind of like a sip load

655
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:31,450
balancer a little bit you know that

656
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:34,659
we're really taking invites from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

657
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:36,280
our CMS is our call management server is

00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,040
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> equivalent of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> class five</font>

660
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,450
CMS is making an initial routing

661
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,610
decision usually a local routing

662
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,710
decision so it's only looking in at the

663
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:50,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">MPN x-axis within a specific geographic</font>

666
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:58,600
the CM essence the sip invite to the

667
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:00,760
cipro proxy supra proxy does an enum dip

668
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,129
into our intelligent routing database

669
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,140
were defining which which phone numbers

670
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:08,830
point to really which destinations in

terms of peers session border controller

672
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,659
so what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that egress path is defined</font>

673
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,460
then it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know at that point in</font>

686
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,699
you'll see you know team say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

687
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,989
where the network letter guys really

688
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:51,578
need to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the application layer</font>

689

guys and sometimes application letter

00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:56,379
guys have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same mentality so it</font>

691
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:58,859
should just work but what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> found is</font>

692
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:01,089
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand</font>

693
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:03,190
physically where you put your session

694
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:06,250
border controllers in your network of

695
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:09,069
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> species are located in our a pops</font>

696
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:11,740
but our major a pops are within you know

697
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:13,960
three or four router hops from all of

698
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:17,709
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> backbone peering points so that you</font>

699
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,540
know we couple our peering circuits the

00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,180
physical interconnections with the pier

701
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,950
with the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> SPC's in the same city so</font>

702
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,868
so you know we make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

703
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,598
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a deterministic path an</font>

example we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go across the Chicago</font>

706
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,720
parenting link not a New York peering

707

708
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,890
that's for you know the vast majority of

709
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:40,750
time so you avoid a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hair painting</font>

710
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:42,670
all across the nation just to get you

711
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:45,220
know these voice and media packets

712
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,740
between each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other so it's important</font>

713
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the two teams your voice team and</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm making those decisions and that</font>

they understand the impacts<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each</font>

the the traffic from a BGP perspective

00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,910
the links<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see that the traffic</font>

737
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,940
shifted from to other sites and actually

738

shifted and an asymmetric manner the

750
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:24,190
BGP is rican verging quickly enough that

751
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:27,100
customers aren't experiencing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead air</font>

753
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,110
enough that the wait a couple seconds

758
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,700
it's hard to there's really no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

759
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:48,040
detect that automatically a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hang up as a</font>

760
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,350
normal end of a voice conversation right

761
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,270
so you don't know what normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> hang ups</font>

762
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,920
are occurring<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus which which</font>

763
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,570
customer hang ups are occurring due to

764
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,520
some type of an outer so correlating

765
00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:01,540
between the two can can definitely be a

766
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:05,490
challenge so what I did is overlaid this

767
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:09,100
pairing<font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Giggy link volume and the</font>

768
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:11,290
little hard to pick up<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the the graph</font>

769
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,819
behind it are the concurrent session

770
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,890
counts on the session border controller

771
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:17,230
so you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Giggy link</font>

772
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,790
outage events didn't have an impact on

773
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,590
how much traffic was being carried on

774
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">the session border controller we are</font>

775
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:26,470
still keeping calls active throughout

776
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,210
this outage event so BGP is basically

777
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,330
doing what it's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to without</font>

778
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:34,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">creating an impact at this at the</font>

779
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:37,779
application layer there was the second

780
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:40,450
event<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 1010 is the one instance where</font>

781
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,100
we see that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the you know</font>

782
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,750
customers would have experienced<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

783
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:47,529
and hung<font color="#E5E5E5"> up their phone and we see a</font>

784
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:48,570
sharp volume on a decrease of calls on

785
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,660
the session border

786
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:55,780
so so a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that are helping us</font>

787
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:57,730
bgp we have bgp hello timer sip options

788
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">paying is doing essentially the same</font>

789
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,930
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sip level well the</font>

790
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,850
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three or more minutes right so</font>

791
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,529
none of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to help us from</font>

792
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,700
a customer experience perspective the

793
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,010
customer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to wait three</font>

794
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:13,060
minutes right before they they hang up

795
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:15,190
the phone so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really falls back to be</font>

796
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:18,520
you peak emergence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP convergence</font>

797
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:21,310
time is quick enough then customer

798
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:24,790
experiences as effectively you know as

799
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:26,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's transparent to them I guess how</font>

800
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:29,020
else were protected at the application

801
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,700
layer is not so much for active calls

802
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:35,530
but for new calls that get established

803
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:37,240
so the sip invite timer is you know

804
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,520
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a four second timer you're</font>

805
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,799
sending out three sip invites if the

806
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,390
invite first in light doesn't reach up

807
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,310
here second invite doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach and</font>

808
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:47,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">peer 30</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might doesn't reach up here then</font>

809
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,910
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intelligence you want to build</font>

810
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:51,250
in your network is to try a different

811
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:53,500
path or even more so potentially even a

812
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:55,420
different carrier so you as a peer as

813
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,820
your first preferred path you can't

814
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,220
reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pier then you are you know</font>

815
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,320
route<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance basically to to a transit</font>

816
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,490
provider so you have you're going to

817
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,320
increase the availability of your

818
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:07,060
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may add in a you know a</font>

819
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,680
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of expense but you're doing</font>

820
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:14,770
that you know to improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> your customer</font>

821
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:17,410
experience some so some tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

822
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:19,540
in comcast a lot of them you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

823
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:23,170
is based on SNMP poll and so we're

824
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:25,119
bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in SNMP data and in this</font>

825
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:28,750
example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> session border controller is</font>

826
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,060
you know from those sip invites if three

827
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:35,740
sipping lights are sent no response is

828
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:38,650
is received from your peer then SBC

829
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:41,379
generates a sip 500 message a server

830
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:44,530
server failure which is equivalent to

831
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:47,680
like a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> at 34 or a router manse</font>

832
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:51,040
message in a voice TM world so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

833
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,750
track these sip 500 messages at 503 for

834
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,240
example and trend them at the same time

835
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:59,750
and day of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous week and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

837
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:04,530
spikes compared to the previous week

838
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,290
trigger and alarm are at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

841
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,830
customer service impacting because we

842
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,410
have chosen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to route advance to transit</font>

845
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,150
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the customer experience</font>

00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,770
will continue to stay positive in

847
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,810
addition to helping us control our

848
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,160
expense because the transit providers

849
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:33,420
are not necessarily our lowest cost

850
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:35,339
route so in closing you kind of

00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,730

you down to the weeds now in my

presentation get down to the bits and

886
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:32,420
bytes just kind of give you a connection

00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:35,029
see story about a conflict all

888
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:40,190
coincidence of a bite choice by pattern

889
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:46,900
choice which has some interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact</font>

890
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:49,940
to how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass engineer IV pear pod so</font>

891
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:54,880
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened was there was some sort of</font>

892
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:59,089
congestion event and this is the diagram

893
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:02,180
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually came and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the George talked</font>

894
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:04,339
talked about the voice guys and you know

895
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:06,109
IP guys they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't always actually the</font>

896
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:08,660
importance of boys guys and I think I

897
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:10,578
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to each other in during this</font>

898
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,229
event<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually it's pretty hard for</font>

899
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:14,930
the voice guys are getting a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

900
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:17,629
tickets you know complaints from

901
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:20,149
customer and they couldn't figure out

902
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,910
why and it took them in a couple of days

903
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:28,910
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> nail down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the I in heaven IV guy says</font>

904
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:31,940
okay that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your problem so so you know</font>

905
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:37,729
obvious from this child use year that

906
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:40,910
traffic is clipping and so we also

907
00:44:37,729 --> 00:44:43,879
notice that there's a asymmetric traffic

908
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:47,348
the ingress is clipping the egress is

909
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:50,059
not so you know it happened that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

910
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:53,359
multiple pathways and a part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

911
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:56,660
not really balanced the well so problem

912
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:59,058
solved just by dealing you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

913
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:04,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">load balancing two directions of the</font>

914
00:44:59,059 --> 00:45:08,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">traffic but what what strange to me is</font>

915
00:45:04,249 --> 00:45:10,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the clipping seems to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

916
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit earlier than</font>

917
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:15,160
you know usually you will see you would

918
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:18,038
expect it's like it around<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty five</font>

919
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent right usually you in the IP pipe</font>

920
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:23,469
you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a clipping at the 90-95</font>

921
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:28,479
send it so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal but 85 is way too</font>

922
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:32,559
early so little bit background on this

923
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:35,319
pipe is in OC 48 pipe and mostly I know

924
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,719
on this rod and an extent of traffic is

925
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:40,869
a VoIP traffic so when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

926
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:43,959
symmetric and on voice application well

927
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:46,449
no it's g.711 encoding low silence

928
00:45:43,959 --> 00:45:49,629
suppression funny millisecond

929
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:53,679
packetization this actually helps me to

930
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:56,829
calculate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packet per second so at</font>

931
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:59,589
first so we were kind of suspect it's

932
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:04,390
the rod car that the packet processing

933
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:06,578
is the culprit right but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end we</font>

934
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:11,109
did a calculation the packet per second

935
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:16,089
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so so what so I</font>

936
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:20,109
asked Ron and Peter actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

937
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:22,538
something about the hdlc framing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

938
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:26,259
might have something to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that so</font>

939
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:29,920
I looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the hdlc framing and what</font>

940
00:46:26,259 --> 00:46:33,069
it is what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> find fun is that there's an</font>

941
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,189
interesting thing about the flag so

942
00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:41,890
hdl-c its variable frame size

943
00:46:36,189 --> 00:46:46,390
encapsulation so so the flag is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7e and</font>

944
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:49,328
so in in the data portion of that frame

945
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,788
you have to escape that so 7e one bite

946
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:55,449
of 70 you basically need to buy two

947
00:46:51,789 --> 00:47:00,339
turns hold it on the wire it becomes a

948
00:46:55,449 --> 00:47:04,869
70 and 5e and then you at need to escape

949
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:09,249
seven DMD becomes innocent unified d so

950
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:11,890
that is the hdlc for any standard then

951
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:14,529
next I looked at actually had to you

952
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:19,180
know we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a live</font>

953
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:21,370
you know data sniffing data from network

954
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:26,830
so i had to call up the lab and they did

955
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:29,080
the lab capture of this 7-eleven he said

956
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:36,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">will capture what I know this is yeah</font>

957
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:36,569
okay if you notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a lot of 7e</font>

958
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:50,080
yeah so so a lot of 7 dns enemy so why

959
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:56,080
the questions why right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if these</font>

960
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:58,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">fights are in the hdlc frame then you</font>

961
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:04,000
need two packages for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one bite and</font>

962
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:08,020
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause a problem so again</font>

963
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,360
I asked around and my you know college

964
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:13,000
professor they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> Peter from the</font>

965
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:16,660
University of Kansas actually he was one

966
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,710
of the you know patent holders of adpcm

967
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:23,859
so he knows a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about voicing holdings</font>

968
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:27,180
so from this perspective it's just a

969
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:30,790
regular voice encoding it indicates a

970
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:34,990
low voice energy meaning you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

971
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:37,240
talking so I also looked at that you say

972
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:43,000
I mean laments back and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

973
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:46,540
there is in this respects 7yi<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7d yeah</font>

974
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,730
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are basically silence hearing so</font>

975
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:51,490
what turns out is that it's pretty

976
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:53,980
interesting when you're not talking on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

977
00:48:51,490 --> 00:49:02,379
wire we're using double the bits to

978
00:48:53,980 --> 00:49:05,200
transport on on the positives<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

979
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of the older you know data guys and</font>

980
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,879
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if either whatever they probably</font>

981
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:15,160
knew about it but in a new guys like<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

982
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:17,760
it really was a surprise and further<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

983
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:21,970
also did some calculation based on the

984
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,760
ether real capture basically on during

985
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:27,459
the silence period we are using about in

986
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,640
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty self send more bits down the</font>

987
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,380
wall

988
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:36,750
just to transport to your silence packet

989
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:40,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you're not talking so that the</font>

990
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:44,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">imputation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is ur when you do the</font>

991
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:47,590
capacity planning on your on your paws

992
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:51,130
links you really need to leave some

993
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:53,920
extra head rooms because of this effect

994
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:56,650
I think you know if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

995
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,750
enterprise probably the codecs are not 7

996
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:03,280
11 but on the all the carriers are the

997
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:07,090
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his semi 11 and I also looked at</font>

998
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:10,300
you know when these standards were made

999
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:13,900
right semi levels in the 80s and HDFC in

1000
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:16,420
the 1990s so kind of soup boxes so when

1001
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,970
the hdlc guys when they make the in a

1002
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,710
selection of this training by they could

1003
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:24,549
choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different by pattern you know</font>

1004
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:27,010
and we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that problem but</font>

1005
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway so here's just the kind of an</font>

1006
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:33,520
interesting art artifacts and it came to

1007
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:39,450
me as a surprise that and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to</font>

1008
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">share with you guys and that's it</font>

1009
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,100

offering inexpensive voice services will

1022
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,609
find more success a second one that I

1023
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:48,710
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting was that for</font>

00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:18,400
like the panelists to comment on these

1040
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:33,079
in this this year and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the some of</font>

1043
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:44,029
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll start actually let's</font>

1044
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:46,390
start with Tim so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing is</font>

1045
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:49,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

nontraditional wireless wireline

1047
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:54,140
carriers basically will not be able to

1048
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:55,819
tap into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the into the SMS world they see</font>

1049
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:57,618
all these wireless guys in verizon

1050
00:52:55,819 --> 00:53:02,029
wireless ATT making a ton of money off

1051
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:03,589
of off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> texting and and in some</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless operators are saying that at</font>

1053
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:06,589
some point in the next couple of years

1054
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:09,589
they're going to make more money<font color="#E5E5E5"> off of</font>

1055
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:11,680

1058
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:17,118
off of messaging so that's one key area

1059
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,629
we're seeing his wire line operators

1060
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">went to tap</font>

1061
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:23,450
that world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> another is enterprises</font>

1062
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:25,519
want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to a lot of enterprises</font>

1063
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,410
have these great really<font color="#E5E5E5"> full-featured IP</font>

1065
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:31,609
beyond voice however they generally

1066
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,140
don't do anything beyond voice outside

1067
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:35,509
their enterprise so if they can do video

1068
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:37,640
calls between<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise aid</font>

1070
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,730
share presence information those kind of

1071
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:45,109
things or trends we're seeing that that

1072
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:51,740
we think are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen in 2010 and</font>

1073
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:55,098
beyond from from Sprint's perspective

1074
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:58,279
all the voice<font color="#CCCCCC"> side that it's really has</font>

1075
00:53:55,099 --> 00:54:02,329
to do with cost-cutting so the sip VoIP

1076
00:53:58,279 --> 00:54:07,700
of voice over IP is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost-effective</font>

1077
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:11,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that's what we are going on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sales</font>

1078
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:15,740
side we do see a lot of opportunities<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,869
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise the IP PBX and that's</font>

1080
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:23,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">also well there is were carrying a</font>

1081
00:54:17,869 --> 00:54:24,950
litter yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think comcast services</font>

1082
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:27,500
team is looking at the same thing

1083
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:30,740
providing your septic<font color="#E5E5E5"> trunk to Tanner</font>

1084
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:33,230
prizes internal to the network so maybe

1085
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:36,410
less transparent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think externally but</font>

1086
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:38,839
um you know just using<font color="#CCCCCC"> sip for</font>

1087
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:41,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">intelligent voice call routing starting</font>

1088
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:44,569

1089
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:46,910
equivalent type things you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a as</font>

1090
00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:50,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">an operator that you know sit becomes a</font>

1091
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:54,019
nice replacement protocol to do that so

1092
00:54:50,859 --> 00:54:57,078
at least right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now um you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see it</font>

1093
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:59,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">more as a replacement protocol yes then</font>

1094
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:03,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">potentially a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> revenue generating</font>

1096
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:08,660
it's a it's a very it's a very nice

1097
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:12,500
replacement protocol and while there are

1098
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:14,899
a lot of inter carrier interrupt is as

1099
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:18,049
you start working those out internal to

1100
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:20,350
your own network that you become much

1101
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:23,770
much better<font color="#CCCCCC"> versed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font>

00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,770
external carriers

1103
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:42,970
pardon me yeah we're seeing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1104
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:47,790
growth in to the the application like

1105
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:51,609
using sip for lots of interesting

1106
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:54,070
different things and you know voice

1107
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">being just a small piece of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the enterprise is all wanting to go</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay any questions from the audience</font>

1112
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:28,520
hi during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past year we had a number</font>

1113
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:32,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of our clients who wanted to move over</font>

1114
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:36,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a void based solution as a call</font>

1115
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:38,480
gateway and they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do it beyond</font>

1116
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,610
just cost savings measures day you

1117
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to do it for the versatility and</font>

1118
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:46,580
the flexibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it offered one</font>

1119
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:50,900
hundred percent of these customers

1120
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:55,580
rolled back to using PR<font color="#E5E5E5"> i--'s because of</font>

1121
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:59,030
the experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could tell you that our</font>

1122
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:01,700
network has very little jitter very

1123
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:04,850
little latency what their experience was

1124
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:09,710
still horrible nonetheless is there a

1125
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:13,069
standard for doing voice qos that could

1126
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:18,460
be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> intercarrier so that it would</font>

1127
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:22,730
facilitate the use a void and set

1128
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:24,830
between carriers and use be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to make</font>

1129
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:34,220
they used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gateways more</font>

1130
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:37,970
effective yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think on the nail</font>

1131
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:41,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Walker we do have those probes and that</font>

1132
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:46,129
can measure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-to-end voice quality</font>

1133
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:49,300
and actually that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the ways for</font>

1134
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:52,760
the voice lock to pinpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP prob</font>

1135
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:57,250
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a first day if they find out that</font>

1136
00:57:52,760 --> 00:58:01,400
the latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jilly issues and</font>

1137
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:04,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's hard comes to them so for the end</font>

1138
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:07,330
user application probably it's it comes

1139
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:11,380
out the cost issue how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1140
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:14,810
proactively measure this type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> God</font>

1141
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:18,400
yeah well I I guess the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question I'm</font>

1142
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:22,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking goes beyond measuring it goes to</font>

1143
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:26,030
you guys are tier<font color="#CCCCCC"> one provider and you</font>

1144
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:28,010
you have a lot of flexibility that the

1145
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:30,560
folks that are delivering the consumer

1146
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:32,750
grade the folks that our business

1147
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:37,070
clients are connecting to as call

1148

gateways don't have how can we deliver

1149
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:41,840
those services or how can we deliver

1150
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:47,420
better services through these call

1151
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:50,090
gateway organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver these</font>

1152
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:52,160
types of services a I don't know sprint

1153
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:54,380
offers it to small and<font color="#E5E5E5"> midsize</font>

1154
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,940
businesses but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a number of</font>

1155
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:59,630
organizations out there that do offer

1156
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:07,940
that but the experience has not been a

1157
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:09,590
good one right<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they to the qos is</font>

1158
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,400
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a network element</font>

1159
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:14,810
problem it's an end-to-end problem and

1160
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,580
there to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not aware of it</font>

1161
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:18,020
it really standards out there I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1162
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,029
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these I've seen is obviously making</font>

1163
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,890
sure your codecs are in sync but even

1164
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:24,530
codec implementations even if they say

1165
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:26,000
they're g.711 the chipset to implement

1166
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:27,050
at 7-eleven for this one vendor is a

1167
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,620
little bit different than the one that

1168
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:32,090
the other vendor so it's a difficult

1169
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,400
problem especially for voice because

1170
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:36,650
voice is so sensitive to jitter and

1171
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,150
everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I guess the answer</font>

1172
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,550
your question is no real good standard

1173
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:43,280
it can keep it on one network as much as

1174
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:45,050
possible that's good you keep as much

1175
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,070
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> over it but as soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as it starts</font>

1176
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,960
hitting other networks and other

1177
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:49,610
networks it becomes difficult I mean

1178
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,010
there's you know there's things to

1179
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:54,620
measure with Moff scores to see what the

1180
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:55,880
voice quality is but there's no really

1181
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:58,660
clear standard it really is

1182
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,660
interoperability issue

1183
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:10,610
ya think it's all about figuring out

1184
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:13,820
what works best for that one instance I

1185
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:16,080
kind of alluded to that in my slides of

1186
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:20,760
each vendor has their own implementation

1187
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:23,069
ensure there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are standards but the way</font>

1188
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they implement the standard doesn't</font>

1189
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:30,000
necessarily align with the next vendor

1190
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:32,100
and you know they're the proprietary way

1191
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,350
of doing it so they're special messaging

1192
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:38,540
is going to you know provide the better

1193
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:41,970
quality but you have to have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1194
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:45,150
that one vendor to do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1195
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:47,700
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and convert from one codec</font>

1196
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:49,680
to a different codec and you know turn

1197
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:54,210
on a feature here turn off a future

1198
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:56,669
there it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes a real mess and it</font>

1199
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:58,470
takes a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

1200
01:00:56,670 --> 01:01:03,140
painful trying to make it work<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1201
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:05,660
trying to replicate the quality of the

1202
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:08,520
people have come to expect from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PSTN</font>

1203
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:12,480
but at the same time people are also

1204
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:19,259
learning to expect less from you know

1205
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:21,210
their mobile phone yeah so Tom Daley

1206
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:25,010
from dining this is a specific question

1207
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:28,110
format you were using you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot of</font>

1208
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:29,640
sip-based failover techniques to route

1209
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:31,500
around outages in your network when you

1210
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,330
have it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have an issue I'm just</font>

1211
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">curious you know you're essentially</font>

1212
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,410
looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sonic grade failover</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our new</font>

anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gets you to that level or</font>

1216
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,930
is just not there yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't tested</font>

1217
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:48,690
it look what is that sound they could be

1218
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:50,250
a price not protected to answer it so

1219
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:52,230
I'm probably I'm closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1220
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,840
application side<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am to the BGC</font>

1221
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:57,780
side but our approach has been you know

1222
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">very basic and we're not changing any</font>

1223
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:02,580
really the default configurations we're

1224
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:04,529
not trying to force bgp to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

1225
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:08,220
that it's not already very good at and

1226
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:10,770
we add in availability redundancy at the

1227
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:12,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">SIP layer as almost an insurance policy</font>

1228
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:14,730
right you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1229
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:16,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">to route advanced you know to second</font>

1230
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:18,780
carrier very often but in the event we

1231
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:22,290
need to it's there so why not take

1232
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:23,880
advantage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that intelligence how about</font>

1233
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:27,390
just in terms of trying to keep the

1234
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:30,480
calls that are in progress up well in

1235
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:31,950
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so the bgp convergence</font>

1236
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,890
time becomes you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're addressing the</font>

1243

appear multiple locations and your

multiple transit providers we can afford

01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:58,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right that we have that</font>

luxury thanks aunt acapellas five lines

1248
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:03,030

<font color="#E5E5E5">direction where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can kind of signal</font>

1250
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:09,060
you know a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> codecs we have a</font>

1251
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,890
choice you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know at 7-11 729 and a lot of</font>

1252
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:12,299
you mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know some of the</font>

1253
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:14,730
troubles but some of the benefits have

1254
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:18,150
certainly been that flexibility with

1255
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:20,640
that in mind it strikes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that you know</font>

1256
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:23,700
we could maybe enjoy some<font color="#CCCCCC"> AMR why band</font>

1257
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,350
or g 7 22 at some point if this is going

01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to kind of be the way things are</font>

1260
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:32,220
happening from customer interest yet or

1261
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,600
corporate certainly a multi-site

1262
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:36,959
teleconferencing and things like that

1263
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:40,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">seem just right along side this maybe</font>

1264
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,570
somewhere yeah definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1267
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:51,120
i think it's easy to do internal to the

1268
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:52,859
network much like we have you know

challenges on the sip printer outside

1270
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:57,810
you have to have that sip<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop in</font>

1271
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:59,670
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> first and then integrate add HD</font>

find a sip trunk person who will even

1285
01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:30,869
accept that codec in in the stp so it

1286
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,040
doesn't get very far yeah it seems like

1287

it shouldn't have a reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1290
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:44,189
the codec on a per session basis so as

1291
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:46,560
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as both ends can talk HD you know</font>

1292
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:49,140
then it's fine but I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1293
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,910
think there's been enough of a market

1294
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:52,470
demand for it yet to<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive you know</font>

1295

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years thanks from the carrier side</font>

1298
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:02,069
the codec the DSP chip is the most

1299
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:04,349
expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> component so we try to dump it</font>

1300

on as much as possible maybe that's a

1301
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:12,780
why in the middle of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and you</font>

1312
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:52,800
subtract ship traffic yeah yes so it's a

1313
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:54,359
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Falls we're trying to do there</font>

1314
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">two problems solved one is the routing</font>

1315
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:58,529
side of it and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the is the actual</font>

1316
01:05:56,010 --> 01:06:00,480
interconnexion function so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that</font>

1317
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">my company's person we work with</font>

1318
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,740
companies like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is here you try</font>

1319
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,109
to have them facilitate the actual bear

1320
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:08,368
traffic and then new star was actually

1321
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:10,980
working on the routing the side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1322
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:13,079
so but but to physically answer your

1323
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,190
question nothing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> large-scale</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exists</font>

1324
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:17,150
right now this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of was my point</font>

1325
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:19,740
about we need a class for IP network

1326
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:22,300
those still need to be out there

1327
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:25,810
in the confirm that many carriers have

1328
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:29,920
already changed their back down but I

1329
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:32,230
POS<font color="#CCCCCC"> re voice backbone to IP and it's a</font>

1330
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,940
dedicated IP network and they are they

1331
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:36,190
are planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to interconnect these</font>

1332
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:38,500
correct yeah the issue in the United

1333
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">States is it goes back I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think every day</font>

1334
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,210
the point intercarrier compensation it's

1335
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,850
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technical problem it's a business</font>

1336
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:49,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and regulatory problem it actually are</font>

1337
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:59,350
