1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,310
yes

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:09,970
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to welcome you to our</font>

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,969
next session we will have three items

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:17,060
first we will start out with

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,890
that was five panel in a little moment

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:25,650
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we will hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about some asian</font>

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:30,090
network design and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will</font>

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:33,269
have lightning talks in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end so but</font>

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,930
first we will for the next half hour try

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:42,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and discuss the demands on multi service</font>

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:47,100
network operations yes so first let me

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,500
introduce my panelists here first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,360
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you about how we will</font>

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,840
do this panel<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll mainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be like a</font>

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,440
question and I will pass a question and

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,890
we will have the panelist answer and we

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,619
would like the audience very much too if

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,649
you have any questions go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

19
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,930
microphone and pass them as we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> along</font>

20
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:12,180
there will not be a question-and-answer

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,119
session in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end we want the questions</font>

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:20,100
within so it may turn out to be some

23
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:23,939
interaction but for my first question to

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">my panelist is so who are you and why is</font>

25
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,460
it relevant for you to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

26
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:34,309
multi-service networks panel start with

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:37,259
Ted hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm ted celia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> orchids print</font>

28
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,659
why am i up run a multi-service panel

29
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,829
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we deliver multiple services of</font>

30
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,359
our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> or we carry multiple</font>

31
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:47,100
services primarily singing voice also

32
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,309
some voice data we do wholesale

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,259
termination point termination carry some

34
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,630
broadcast video for some people

35
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,630
customers so that's why I'm here

36
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:07,880
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> joe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provo IT software more from an</font>

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,010
bring to this panel is the fact that in

47
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,250
the last few years we've doing a lot

48
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">more live broadcast video life line</font>

49

we do now thank you and finally well

well<font color="#E5E5E5"> but really again more of the end</font>

62
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,690
where we're really focusing our work

63
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,870
right now in four different delivery of

64
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,090
four different services being IPTV which

65
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,150
course has got a significant multicast

66
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,920
component behind it sip peering between

67
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,820
universities which of course basically

68
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,040
has got all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your RTP type</font>

69
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,350
requirements building control systems

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,299
we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a project with NIST the</font>

71
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,940
National Institute of Standards

72
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,590
technology allowing external first

73
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,750
responders to interface with building

74
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,370
control systems and again that really

75
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,860
has more of a latency component to it

76
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,560
and then we've also been part of the

77
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">next generation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 911 deployment which</font>

including what Police Fire ambulance 911

81
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,870
call centers and public entities that

82
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,160
have their own first responder such as

83
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,430
universities

84
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,440
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing to create again one network</font>

85
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,880
that does everything instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having</font>

86
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:25,100
the multiple silo networks well thank

87
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so yeah I put down a few key words</font>

88
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,390
of what people have been saying here

89
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,919
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a little bit more but</font>

90
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,919
this is just for your information if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

91
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a review the slides later so the</font>

92
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,110
overall question that this panel is

93
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:42,650
trying to discuss is what challenges

94
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,560
what new challenges do we have operating

95
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,750
a multi-service<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and I'm trying</font>

96
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">to put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out in a few more questions</font>

97
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,720
that more specific questions but if you

98
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,920
guys have any other questions please

99
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,410
come up and say them the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,870
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to discuss is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network tuning</font>

101
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,930
like what additional demands to multiple

102
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,360
services put on your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

103
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:15,500
measures do take to meet the additional

104
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:21,590
demands<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you take any and yeah I would</font>

105
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:24,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Chris to start haha so one of the</font>

106
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,159
areas that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that was a critical</font>

107
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,090
was having a lot of very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-defined</font>

108
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,440
infrastructure on your network to be

109
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,210
able to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> the services you intend</font>

110
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,640
to do for instance having one cause

111
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,210
model that is implemented the edge in

112
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,789
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cure in the core making sure that</font>

113
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:44,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of your deployment models know how</font>

114
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,490
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this many scripts use it we use</font>

115
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,380
XP beds with mpls for instance and

116
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,070
making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're Bob behaviors</font>

117
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:56,210
are accurate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> reflect the stuff that</font>

118
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:58,460
you're selling we carry everything over

119
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:02,289
mpls for instance it makes it a lot

120
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,299
easier to deploying your services

121
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:05,558
though we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run uncongested network was</font>

122
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,969
just an important you do have to

123
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:11,229
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure scenarios for instance</font>

124
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:13,509
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues that we've had though</font>

125
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:16,058
for instance is validating<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rooter</font>

126
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,680
features for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a mostly</font>

127
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:20,619
cisco network of variety of platforms

128
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:26,099
but not all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS is a corrected equal</font>

129
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:27,969
you have to have a very rigorous

130
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:31,029
validation of the software you're going

131
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:33,248
to use and we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> six-month software</font>

132
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:34,808
roadmap cycle that we validate features

133
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:36,430
for and we know which version we're

134
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:40,419
going to have at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere in</font>

135
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:42,939
the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's interesting so</font>

136
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,339
who would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow up oh I'll take</font>

137
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:47,259
it next on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one you know every time</font>

138
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">we bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into application to the network</font>

139
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:50,680
again as we go through the third or

140
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:52,300
fourth round of<font color="#E5E5E5"> convergence you know and</font>

141
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,889
obviously we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> started off with data</font>

142
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,089
and that was pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> straightforward I</font>

143
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I guys know how to do that pretty</font>

144
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:59,020
well started adding video conferencing

145
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,059
all of a sudden our data folks are

146
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,219
suddenly introduced into this concept of

147
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:05,020
jitter yeah woody what do we do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

148
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:07,569
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage manage and control it</font>

149
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,959
and then of course IPTV added the whole

150
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:13,120
aspect of multicast and now with the ng

151
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,719
911 stuff it looks like we're adding

152
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,999
ipv6 to the mix as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatly</font>

153
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,949
enhancing the requirements for security

154
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:22,180
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> every one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these cases Oh in</font>

155
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,499
building control systems they've been a

156
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,019
whole challenge all into themselves

157
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:27,699
again not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only for security reasons but</font>

158
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:30,039
most of them are kind of designed around

159
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:32,169
you know IBM<font color="#CCCCCC"> SNA type architectures</font>

160
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,479
where it's a polling system which is

161
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:36,039
very very very latency sensitive and if

162
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,449
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have all that controlled in</font>

163
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,580
essence things start to crater pretty

164
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,680
quickly so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> every case it's been a</font>

165
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,779
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of responding figuring out what</font>

166
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,039
the application wants and needs and then

167
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:47,949
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fine tune</font>

168
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,628
<font color="#CCCCCC">your network to be able to to support it</font>

169
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:52,209
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't end up in a situation where</font>

170
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:54,189
the applications guys are saying if your

171
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:55,749
network didn't stink we'd be fine here

172
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:57,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then the guy network eyes saying</font>

173
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:58,930
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> if your application was in poorly</font>

174
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:02,289
designed we wouldn't have issues either

175
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,459
so we mainly end up doing being the

176
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,889
Switzerland here trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

177
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:07,910
negotiations between between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:09,770
sides to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to try to come up to</font>

179
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,330
to a reasonable middle ground but for

180
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,120
the most part<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to say it's</font>

181
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,090
been very proactive and very you know

182
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">pre-emptive but the reality is it it</font>

183
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,780
breaks and we figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to fix it</font>

184
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,510
Ted I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing here but</font>

185
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,919
from an operational aspect one of the

186
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,539
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see all quite often is when</font>

00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,580
you roll into the service out<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

have your sales people selling SLA is

190
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,900
that your operations people<font color="#E5E5E5"> know nothing</font>

191
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,070
about it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a common problem so</font>

192
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,000
that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest demands you</font>

193
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,650
have is to make sure when your

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,059
salespeople glassell something that

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really becoming prevalent is</font>

198
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,430
with all of the promised new Ethernet

199
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,520

don't exist yet for Ethernet services

202
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,790
it's kind of interesting at least here

203
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,020
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> States so that's one of the big</font>

204
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,730
challenges we're seeing these days is

205
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,800
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually made how do you marry</font>

206
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,060
up the essays for Ethernet services that

207
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're selling from Ethan and services</font>

208
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,010
you're buying and it's quite a challenge

209
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,660
and I kind of laughed at Joe and he said

210
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,780
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

211
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:22,250
he's absolutely right it's funny how

212
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything comes back around so that's a</font>

213
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,430
big challenge from an operational

214
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:30,530
perspective huge one and a lot of their

215
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,359
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the comments from Walt</font>

216
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:36,010
could have been straight from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kirk from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">my day job we have we have a lot of</font>

218
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:43,400
since we carry a lot of what some might

219
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,690
consider unusual protocols the second

220
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,800
third order effects of data loss or

221
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:53,880
delay becomes apparent in

222
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,829
real-world effects of lack of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,709
lack of seat availability for somebody

booking a flight that winds up being

226
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:10,050
strict SLA is similar to similar to what

227
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:12,450
Ted was describing and and we have even

228
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,000
even compared to strict ISP change

229
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:18,450
control we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an extremely strict</font>

235
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,100
so on and so forth for every change it's

236
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,990
a quite a different environment than a

nice p environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> operation side that</font>

238

way yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you kind of jumped a little</font>

239
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:51,329
bit ahead of some of my questions

240
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,970
starting with the change control<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:59,910
technical tuning of your protocols do

243
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:06,060
you have any additional demand sorry

244
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:09,199
suggest business as usual the doing

245
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:13,410
doing accelerated spanning tree stuff

246
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,300
having to go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor specific layer</font>

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:25,859
meats and the availability guidelines we

250
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:28,200
migrated a bunch of internal payload

251
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,260
traffic to multicast so well you can

252
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,620
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect jitter in a video or audio</font>

253
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,939
stream as it's happening I had to

254
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,490
educate a lot of the engineers about

<font color="#CCCCCC">easier you know for example from what</font>

262
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:58,680
I've seen I have yet to see a reliable

reasonable multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool that in</font>

264
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,670
essence really took it right up to the

265
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,990
multicast level across multiple vendors

266
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,209
multiple environments that where you

267
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,090
actually understood when all of a sudden

268
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:11,070
for example join on a remote network

269
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,630
suddenly no longer worked so what

270
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,850
happens now is when all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a sudden</font>

271
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,220
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to fail it ends up with a</font>

272
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,900
lot of manual troubleshooting that

273
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,700
literally can take in two hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

274
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,490
hours of trying to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

275
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,890
along the process where along the

276
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,270
process the thing is cratered with that

277
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,189
type of thing basically hopefully

278
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,199
hopefully we'll see some reasonable

279
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,180
tools coming out in that space might not

280
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,760
be as much of an issue for for the

<font color="#E5E5E5">carrier's in that day in essence really</font>

control the entire multicast within

their entire entire network I think

284
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,530
that's a discussion we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,490
five layer hierarchy where you've got

295
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,709
from end to end and trying to

296
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,600
troubleshoot in that type of world is

297
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,880
pretty tough I think ultimately though

298
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,410
that's probably where hopefully most

299
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,410
services will ultimately end up going

300
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay anybody else</font>

301
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:27,789
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put up a slide now with the</font>

305
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,609
talk much about quality of service

306
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:44,559
that's one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have</font>

316

get a break it down into categories an

317
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:13,669
internal customer set which in this case

318
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:15,529
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be for us would be our wireless</font>

people or our intro network control

00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:20,239
people and as the external segment which

321
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:23,029
is the customer base customers of course

324
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,929

325
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:34,039
customizable for<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much whatever</font>

326
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:35,449
the customer wants internally when the

327
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,279
control network says we move more and

328
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:39,049
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of those move more and more</font>

329
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,119
towards the packet domain then will we

330
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:42,259
will ultimately have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run part of the</font>

331
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,220
service in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coiler network which is</font>

332
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,869
not really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to do right</font>

333
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,309
because you want to get two choices

334
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:49,869
right you can forward packets or you can

335
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:52,189
count packets but you can't do both and

336
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:55,159
we're headed that direction ultimately

337
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:57,139
there's no way around it it's just it's

338
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,749
just reality as the convergence

339
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,639
continues to happen but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is</font>

340
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:03,049
yes but in terms of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

341
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,279
buzzwords you want to try and keep it

342
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:08,119
simple because you got to operate it

343
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:10,429
right not it you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't all maybe</font>

344
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:13,879
we all came from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NOC but we all want</font>

345
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:16,608
to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and work on the knob right so</font>

346
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,439
the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is yes but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing to</font>

347
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:19,429
do is you do logical overlays and one

348
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,069
thing that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> missing here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font>

349
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:24,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">I said is is one of the tricks of the</font>

350
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:27,169
trade is use private addresses in your

351
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:29,240
network to your advantage right because

352
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:31,819
you can veil things that way very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily</font>

353
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,140
right and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of everyone says</font>

354
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,100
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to do that but we</font>

355
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:39,860
all do that so yes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer your</font>

356
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,709
question it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you yeah</font>

357
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,570
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also kind of hoping that</font>

358
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,790
hopefully within the next year year and

359
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,740
a half is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wireless carriers start to</font>

360
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,410
roll out IMS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really start to see</font>

361
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,540
the ability to in essence one of the

362
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:57,829
inherent advantages of IMS is that it

363
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:00,500
has ability to honor honor qos

364
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,970
parameters from one carrier's network to

365
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,310
another carrier's network now whether or

366
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,050
not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually ends up being deployed</font>

367
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,300
that way or being implemented that way

368
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,010
is yet to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen but for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first time</font>

369
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,319
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got a capability that</font>

370
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,970
looks pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome not only to be able</font>

371
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go from here area to carrier be but</font>

372
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,000
also go from carrier a carrier be to

373
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,870
enterprise a to enterprise be as well so

374
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,730
for the first time ever is the

375
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,050
enterprise we're kind of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

376
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,420
considered as<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of the network</font>

377
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:31,540
instead of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just thing sitting</font>

378
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,540
outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud if it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

379
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:43,349
any questions from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> others at this</font>

380
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:45,660
point so Joe you were no sorry that was

381
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:49,290
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> early but I was thinking</font>

382
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring I know the monitoring systems</font>

383
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:57,480
that we use in our network<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is mostly</font>

384
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:59,400
reactive systems to do see you have new

385
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,450
demands and you need new monies from

386
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,879
tools for these services yeah I started

387
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:10,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">to allude to it before that there's that</font>

388
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,430
there's um seeing we see cascading

389
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,280
effects when there's errors on the

390
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,710
network that translate into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

391
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:24,829
bread and butter of the of the

392
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:27,540
applications so we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a lot of</font>

393
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:33,179
monitoring built<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the applications</font>

394
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:36,420
to allow them to actually to actually

00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:39,570
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> signaling within the system in</font>

397
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:45,480
have been working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on coupling some of</font>

398
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:48,420
the specific feedback loops that we have

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,650
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that area in addition to</font>

400
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:56,610
standard like automated<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT monitors</font>

402
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:02,699
perf and and doing like some test runs

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,050
with trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll at BW</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bandwidth</font>

405
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,230
tool as a good multicast testbed like

406
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:11,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">you were saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's not a</font>

407
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:13,970
lot of useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> Diagnostics there in the</font>

408
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,970
vendor space

409
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,900
good in that same light to you know

410
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,610
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been looking desperately for again</font>

411
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,040
for years for reasonable tools that will

412
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,449
deal with application looking at the

413
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,550
application side of as well because like

414
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said to be between the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video guys and</font>

415
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data guys for years we've had battle</font>

416
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,920
go same thing with the application side

417
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,810
of it for years the application guys

418
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,520
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been saying well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if your network</font>

419
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,200
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stink my application to running</font>

420
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,820
fine and the network guys are going well

421
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,980
if your application was properly tuned

422
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,840
it wouldn't be an issue as well so being

423
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,730
able to get in to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> some refereeing</font>

424
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,669
tools this in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be</font>

425
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,230
great so one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

426
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,180
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more involved in</font>

427
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,310
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data with transporting for</font>

00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,620

429
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,810
traffic we're actually controlling the

430
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,209
Codex at either end of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link and they</font>

levels how many frames been drops the

433
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,510
jitter and so on and we have a section

00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,850
that it's within a certain set

437
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,320
parameters and if it isn't they have the

438
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">big red phone to the various other parts</font>

439
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,290
of the operations department to make

440
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,420
sure those issues get resolved quickly

441
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,860
it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things where if there's</font>

442
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">a major sporting event</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you don't</font>

443
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,159
want your screens to freeze because

444
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">people start losing jobs when that</font>

445
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,430
happens

446
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:37,150
my two cents worth literally so speaking

447
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,800
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big carrier perspective in the</font>

448
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,320
big carrier world if it's critical you

449
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">still do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in twos we're done this full</font>

450
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,570
time one of us have backed up its air

451
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,080
etc from the customer perspective some

452
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:51,700
of them do that when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to voice</font>

453
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,449
termination and voip termination

454
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:58,090
primarily the operations reaction times

455
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,440
are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good enough the problem is</font>

456
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,610
when you when you when you come from the

457
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,840
internet space and you run a packet

458
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and you just doing the big big</font>

459
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,179
internet which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is cool and you start</font>

460
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,159
putting all these real services<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it</font>

461
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,530
your operations staff don't transition

462
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,880
that quickly to that and so the reaction

463
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,129
times aren't always as quick as you'd

464
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,440
like to see the understanding of

465
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:17,290
maintenance activities making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

466
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,610
you metric up certain links out of

467
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,710
service before you do your<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

468
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,120
your mains<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolutions and cleanly and</font>

469
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,010
easily shift traffic back and forth

470
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,270
still is lost on people because they

471
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,410
come from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world of well we have two</font>

475
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,080
proactive monitoring isn't really there

00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,750
that you wishes would be there it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

477
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,520
there right the reality is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is all</font>

478
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,890
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> new stuff still we're only</font>

479
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking what five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years the most of the</font>

480
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,970
stuff is that so video hasn't been

481
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,670
riding over the internet for five years

482
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,140
in broadcast quality so we'll get there

483
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,580
but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there yet so there's</font>

484
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:59,020
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lag as well I guess what I'm</font>

485
00:20:51,580 --> 00:21:01,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">really saying yeah I think</font>

486
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:05,379
so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the monies for muster all</font>

487
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,940
too sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> my Segway going for the</font>

488
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,740
monitoring over to the change management

489
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:13,420
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gil was mentoring get a little</font>

490
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:15,820
bit and you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean can you can you</font>

491
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">elaborate more about have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you tightening</font>

492
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,530
your juice I mean you if you're

493
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:23,350
running a video /<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the the network</font>

494
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,149
does speak events change management

495
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,129
controls have changed drastically the

496
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,450
the days of everyone having an able

497
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:32,290
we'll go ahead and login and change it

498
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:34,090
over you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> are gone the change</font>

499
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,010
management procedure is very very very

500
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,020
rigorous usually two to three weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

501
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,790
what used to be a day hey I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

502
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,090
bounce this guy tomorrow night all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

503
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:45,760
you know that's gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in the number</font>

504
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:48,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">of what you called national events where</font>

505
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,870
no changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network are allowed seems</font>

506
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:56,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doubling every year I don't know</font>

507
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:58,209
why but it is so yeah there's in the

508
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,590
last bullet is there such a thing as I

509
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean it's a revolution with no customer</font>

510
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,500
impact of it yes there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if everything</font>

511
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">works perfectly yeah nine times out of</font>

512
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,890
ten it doesn't you know and someone

513
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,810
always forgets to notify somebody or

514
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:14,020
they didn't read the email is usually

515
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:15,520
what happens right you know and and then

516
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:23,590
that and we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net result</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

517
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:25,240
that yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as part of the fire</font>

518
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,560
control service that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're currently</font>

519
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,120
running up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the UK one of the</font>

520
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,320
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ADF head for us</font>

521
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:35,469
was ISO 20000 27001 and compliance which

522
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,419
is scary<font color="#CCCCCC"> iso stuff mostly it's</font>

523
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,180
procedural but it's talking about

524
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:43,150
explicit management controls over change

525
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,770
on your network who has access when do

526
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,620
they have access under what

527
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,870
circumstances who needs to sign it off

528
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,580
and in what sort of time scales but

529
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,250
additionally there's a huge customer

530
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,990
focus in change control how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

531
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,650
top customers need to give positive

532
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,030
feedback before you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a change</font>

533
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:03,170
one of the issues there then is that you

534
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,910
then have to negotiate early we

535
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,490
changes can be with a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

536
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,410
customer if<font color="#E5E5E5"> their customers live on four</font>

537
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,880
continents at the same time they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

538
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,500
very picky<font color="#CCCCCC"> about when you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

539
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,500
changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that affect their service and</font>

540
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,570
again about the no customer impact it's

541
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,490
it's a risk thing and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

542
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,350
make changes have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to evaluate</font>

543
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,910
the risk that a change has and the

544
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,469
change control in your management and

545
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,450
everybody else have to come to an

546
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:35,180
evaluation on can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make this change</font>

547
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:37,250
and when can we make it i mentioned

548
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:41,780
before a bit about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

549
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:44,630
strip<font color="#CCCCCC"> CM rules that exist we also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

550
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:48,889
tightly tight customer notification

551
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:52,280
integration similar to press we have to

552
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,840
do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of aggressive positive</font>

553
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,590
acknowledgement versus<font color="#E5E5E5"> just fire off the</font>

554
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:01,959
email and hope they read it a lot of a

555
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:08,439
lot of negotiation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for timing the multi</font>

556
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:10,700
with with specific customers multi

executive level of approval<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe I</font>

558
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned and and we have instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

559
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:20,840
increasing number of national events we

560
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:22,670
tend to have freezes based around a big

561
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,459
travel holidays since we're treble

562
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,690
oriented and that kind of gets in the

563
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,710
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of actually getting a lot of work</font>

564
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:32,810
done sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get from the</font>

565
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">University side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the reality there is</font>

566
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,889
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of adopt the best practices</font>

567
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,540
of the carriers and we're probably a few

568
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">years behind you guys in terms of most</font>

569
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,170
implementation but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the major</font>

570
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,630
changes that we've seen over the last

571
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,250
few years is that more and more

572
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,350
educational institutions are becoming

573
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,750
multinational so for example we've now

574
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,010
got a campus and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Qatar as well sooner</font>

575
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,660
you start all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden opening up</font>

576
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,910
campuses in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Middle East and things</font>

577
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,190
like that now you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with 10 our</font>

578
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,560
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone differences in different days</font>

579
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,750
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually take their weekend</font>

580
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,399
than we do so our<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunities for</font>

581
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,320
extended maintenance outages and stuff

582
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,850
like that things for for first server

583
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,010
updates and everything else is almost

584
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,070
gone away so it's gotten to be it's

585
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,529
getting to be more and

586
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:16,710
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge to try to figure out when</font>

587
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:18,630
the services when is your downtime it's

588
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:22,019
almost it's almost getting to the point

589
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:26,070
where the downtime is never okay thank

590
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:28,350
you at this point I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see to</font>

591
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,269
hear if did we cover everything that you

592
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:33,769
guys need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I want to know about</font>

593
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:33,769
running most of service networks

594
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:42,750
apparently we did I have a second last

595
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:45,000
question though and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is about the</font>

596
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">future how do you guys look at the</font>

597
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">future do you think that can we can</font>

598
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,970
continue this what we're doing right now

599
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">just putting on another new service that</font>

600
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,740
has different demands from the other

601
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">services on the IP network or do we have</font>

602
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:05,159
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that song sometime I think for</font>

603
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:12,449
the foreseeable future the answer is yes

604
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:13,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I you know the the vendors that supply</font>

605
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,600
the equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soon to be able to</font>

606
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:19,110
actually have kept up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this point with</font>

607
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,840
the demands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like we have</font>

608
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">another paradigm jump in technology</font>

609
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,129
heading down or coming our way the next

610
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:28,500
18 to 24 months which will help that

611
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:31,709
even further and further so probably the

612
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,960
answer is yes as long as the it's really

613
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:36,179
more an expectation management game

614
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,610
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're we're we're basically taking</font>

615
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:40,340
a protocol that wasn't designed for this

616
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:43,918
unfortunate to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

617
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:49,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it wasn't designed to do and it doesn't</font>

618
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:50,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">always work the way we expect it to yeah</font>

619
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that our vendor</font>

620
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:54,059
support is one of the key issues

621
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:56,450
especially if you're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

622
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:58,710
homogeneous across your entire network

623
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,990
but additionally we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

624
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,190
cause issues where there may come a

625
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,710
point where it's just not cost-effective

626
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,210
to use cause ports in your code the core

627
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,220
of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and if you need to run</font>

628
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,720
congested ports you won't be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

629
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the same network simple as that</font>

630
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:18,380
from our aspect the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time</font>

631
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:22,010
traffic in the high bandwidth traffic

632
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:24,590
such as grid computing and links to the

633
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,430
large hadron collider and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Suren and</font>

634
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,199
stuff like that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font>

635
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,640
pull it just is we can't afford to build

636
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,520
separate networks much as it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

637
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,110
nice but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you big convenience it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

638
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,150
going to happen yeah we have a question

639
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:40,370
have you seen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CM process go from</font>

640
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:46,700
speak now or forever hold your peace to

641
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:47,989
everyone must check<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the box yes next</font>

642
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,520
would you like router vendors to quit

643
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,760
talking about bits per second a sort of

644
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,710
how about packets per second sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> dude</font>

645
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,510
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> router vendors to</font>

646
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,040
quit talking about bits per second and

647
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:02,870
start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about packet processing</font>

648
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspective many of them do I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

649
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:11,530
definitely matters to me that's in in

650
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:14,090
question of the final point<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

651
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:17,660
future and traffic growth and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

652
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:22,250
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think yes it you know the real</font>

653
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:25,300
time services can and so far they do

654
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:27,650
coexist them I know hurt pretty well and

655
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,169
you know to waltz point they have to if

656
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,980
we can't we can't duplicate

657
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,760
infrastructure it's just not

658
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,760
economically feasible

659
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:42,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i think any final words ok I</font>

660
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,300
think this was the end of the multi

661
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,190
service network panel and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font>

662
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">to thank you all for coming up here and</font>

663
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:53,750
discuss it I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really interesting</font>

664
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:56,630
i hope the organs do as well so we are

665
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:03,350
about ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our next session so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

666
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:07,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to ask sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeffrey clean</font>

667
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,899
in from pacnet they are to come up here

668
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,180
thank you
