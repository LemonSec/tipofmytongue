149
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:30,219
they're just spot-on we have a lot of

00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,889
registrations from Texas and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

151
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:37,990
first-time attendees so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think overall</font>

152
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:39,219
this is a it's already been worth it we

153
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,110
hope the conference is worth it to you

154
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:42,460
too and we hope that you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see some</font>

of the cool sites that are available in

156
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:50,739
Austin got some unique things around

157
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:53,259
here that we hope you enjoy a benefit of

158
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,699
hosting is that I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few minutes to</font>

nineteen ninety when I started college

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:21,969
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is staggering how much how rich and</font>

173
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:32,169
come to the meetings like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana to make</font>

174
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,490
personal connections but we use the

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,569
internet to maintain those connections

176
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:40,329
and to do so much more but I'm nervous

177
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:43,390
I'm nervous about losing the open

178
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:46,599
Internet and I'm nervous about losing

<font color="#E5E5E5">this amazing world</font>

182
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,609
so net neutrality is obviously the huge

183
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:04,380
issue today the opening presentation

say that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it would preserve the</font>

188
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:17,070
end-to-end principle and it would keep

189
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,020
backbones and ISPs from picking which

190

applications technologies or even

191
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,760
individual companies we're going to be

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,819
our network if you shove this down our

195

throat so when we have important things

196
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,580
to do and it might even<font color="#E5E5E5"> stifle</font>

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,530
feel is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important in the whole</font>

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,400
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the FCC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is proposing a</font>

new net neutrality rule which would

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,520
require non discriminatory practices

under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proposed rule network</font>

214
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,930
providers would not be allowed to

quote reasonable network management this

218
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,720
would allow even some copyright

filtering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> prioritizing of quote</font>

221
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,120
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> will maintain the end to end but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

the same time let network operators run

reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> people might argue around it</font>

225
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,890
but the basic idea sounds pretty sound

226
00:10:51,089 --> 00:11:01,070
right am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> still nervous yeah I am</font>

227

nervous what about privacy

the non-discriminatory<font color="#CCCCCC"> rule supported by</font>

net neutrality advocates and the FCC's

exceptions could end up destroying

privacy implementing the

232
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:21,790
non-discriminatory rule would require

233
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:25,420
ISPs to look at and identify specific

234
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:28,630
content and applications implementing

235
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:32,199
network management would require ISPs to

dreamed about here in the United States

315
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:02,370

years ago at right listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Randy Bush</font>

talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6 and I asked him I</font>

318
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:16,230

323
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:39,119
time warner's helped us out on here so

324
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:42,540
using that's keep it on surfing the

325
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,589
