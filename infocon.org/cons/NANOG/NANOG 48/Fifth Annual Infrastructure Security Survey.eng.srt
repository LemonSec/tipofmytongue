<font color="#E5E5E5">most of the market has shifted or</font>

shifted to using commercial detection

tools detect attacks whether they're

offering a clean pipe service or just

156

last year the results haven't changed

157
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,120
much that as we asked questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

158
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,240
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of the attacks are reported to</font>

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,560
law enforcement as it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been true in</font>

160
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,840
previous years very few I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,210
something like what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results are</font>

162
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,760
sixty seventy percent reported five or

163
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,469
fewer attacks and as we asked questions

164
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,780
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't attacks being reported</font>

165
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,940
the answer is range from jurisdictional

166
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,070
issues you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FBI</font>

170
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,370
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sheer volume of attacks made it</font>

171
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:27,690
impractical to actually report everyone

172
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,030
well switch a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in the</font>

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,020
last three remaining slides into just

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,820
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I find the most</font>

175
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting and that's sort of the</font>

176
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,200
freeform responses we get as part of the

177
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,090
survey I think these do a better job of

178
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,349
giving a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit more insight into</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the you know into thinking into the mood</font>

00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:48,300
of the community as we talk about

181
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,280
different security issues as it came up

182
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,740
on last year a survey there's continues

183
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,780
to be a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern preps frustration</font>

184
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,370
might be a better<font color="#CCCCCC"> word with vendor</font>

185
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,960

a lack filtering at<font color="#CCCCCC"> highline speed</font>

number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles and a lot of responses</font>

189
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,000
this year around v6 basically ranging

190
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,560
from you know my security vendor my

work or they still have a long long way

195
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:29,820
to go with parity with some of the IP IP

196
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:33,150
v4 features you know leading into the

197
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:35,309
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think as we've seen a lot of</font>

198
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,780
folks actually for the first time ipv6

199
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:39,089
is actually something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks a</font>

200
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,419
beginning to plan around the better part

201
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:45,750
of last<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1012</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ipv6 was much more of</font>

202
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,189
a checkbox on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFP now folks are</font>

203
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,030
actually beginning to deploy kit

204
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,860
procedures to deploy it

205
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,870
but there's growing concern about the

206
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability for the network's their vendors</font>

207
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,070
to support it and again we have a quote

208
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,290
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom just I think which echoes</font>

209
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,900
some of the concern around even if your

210
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,060
router vendor switch vendor firewall

211
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,610
supports it do your internal network

212
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,819
procedures support v6 can you roll it

213
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:13,250
out do the same monitoring and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

214
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,860
a lot of concern round b6 and questions

215
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,050
on is the internet really ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

216
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,060
large volume of traffic luckily there's

217
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,250
yet to be a large volume<font color="#CCCCCC"> of traffic so</font>

218
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,849
we're probably okay for a little bit but

219
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,320
clearly a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concern I should</font>

220
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention too that you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

if it was the economy the<font color="#CCCCCC"> weather the</font>

222
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,850
state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry but a lot of the</font>

223
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,610
freeform comments this year tended

224
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,280
towards I think more of frustration

225
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,740
little more towards the melodrama

226
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:46,100
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of concern around v6 lot</font>

227
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,020
of concern around 4-byte asn a lot of

228
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,120
concern about just the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

229
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,370
engineering security groups to respond

230
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,630
and a continuing theme the lack of

231
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:58,640
management support which i think is

232
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:02,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">really echoed in some of these lat and</font>

233
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,850
actually the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last slide again I think</font>

234
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:07,070
real concern about underfunded security

235
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,170
groups concern that they're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,610
comments a lot of concern about the clue

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,430
as these new services are rolled out a

246
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,080
lot of problems explaining some of the

challenges of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud distributed</font>

organizations and providers are under

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing I think scrutiny to provide</font>

251
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,960
higher availability services and you

252
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,030
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the general tenor of some</font>

253
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,950
of the comments again perhaps tending a

254
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,589
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards a melodrama</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad</font>

256
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,430
pessimistic this year than previous

257
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,970
years hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> next year we'll have a</font>

258
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,160
more optimistic response so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

259
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,960
finished with a quick run-through I've

260
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,490
got Danny up here too

261
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,710
delve into any more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the results in</font>

262
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,020
questions but hopefully that provides a

263
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,990
quick snapshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of at least some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

264
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,840
results the full report is available

265
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:17,480
down at the URL at the bottom and it

266
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,870
goes into what 40 50 pages worth of

267
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,880
graphs and diagrams and and comments

268

271
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:39,810
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your in your survey did you ask</font>

any<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions about you know mitigation</font>

273
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,369
tactics that service providers can give

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">to their customers that are essentially</font>

281
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,790
for the most part so we just might phone

00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,170
or engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so we did</font>

283
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,599
actually asked the question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

284
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,040
of the negation techniques that

be divergent like destination or source

289
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,250
based black hole routing or bgp flows

290
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,260
back or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns a record changes</font>

291
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,790
something to that effect so maybe that's

292
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,250
something we should split out in the

293
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,930
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one um one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key trends we've</font>

294
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,430
seen though if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the report</font>

295
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,319
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in five years ago four years</font>

296
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,140
ago three<font color="#E5E5E5"> even even this year is that</font>

297
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the disconcerting things is a lot</font>

298
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,050
of the mitigation techniques like

299
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,730
destination based black hole rallying

300
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,790
effectively complete the attack right

301
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,590
and so you know so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

302
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,939
trends you know i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean i think the</font>

303
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,100
numbers we had said there was a four

304
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,810
percent increase in people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had more</font>

305
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,490
sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns pastry direction</font>

306
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,660
for scrubbing or you know clean pipe

307
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,000
services that kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

308
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">mitigation techniques and so we have</font>

309
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,940
seen some improvement<font color="#E5E5E5"> even with the you</font>

310
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,230
know by doubling the size of the

311
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,570
respondent pool too much smaller

312
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,930
networks and so forth but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

313
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,550
time the trim there is still you know

314
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,290
away from effectively completing the

315
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,240
attack you know at least marginally and

316
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,500
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it would be good to separate</font>

317
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,230
those two questions out next year and

318
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,740
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so great thank you yeah thanks</font>

319
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the question the other questions um</font>

320
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,610
one actually one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to</font>

321
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,750
highlight is you know in craigs in a

322
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,250
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> to last slide they're talking</font>

323
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,660
about the perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> storm if you will and</font>

324
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">it seemed you know the melodrama or you</font>

325
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,250
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of sexy the you know one</font>

326
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,050
of the interesting things here that that

327
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,910
was a resounding theme and everyone that

328
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,040
pretty much everyone that responded to

329
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,829
the survey were sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

330
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,079
the systemic effects<font color="#E5E5E5"> like DNS sack right</font>

331
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,270
if you guys have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying attention</font>

332
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,670
you know

333
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,170
the roots you know been signed signed

334
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,849
and you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> des records aren't</font>

335
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,010
there yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's a valid bit</font>

336
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,530
unvalidated ozone that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

337
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,970
and the thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right when i say</font>

338
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,920
systemic effects is this this thing

339
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,600
happens at the root DNS system somewhere

340
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,550
else on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and that has</font>

341
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,040
impacts on your customers right whether

342
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,050
you sign your own zones are not write

343
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,430
this this might increase call volume and

344
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,959
your health unit your help desk and so

345
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,630
forth so whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you do</font>

346
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,390
anything your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network or not just like</font>

347
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:12,790
32-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> asn 32-bit a ascends um where</font>

348
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,410
somebody could you know you know miss

349
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,699
package something at some far remote

350
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,100
place on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet and that can</font>

351
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,630
impact stuff on your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you</font>

352
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,610
know whether you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything expressly</font>

353
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,050
or not so you as a network operator you

354
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,190
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be paying attention to this much</font>

355
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:27,339
less wrapping your tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other</font>

356
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,600
packages around it um so you know if I

357
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,430
had to highlight anything from the

358
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,320
survey it was some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things that</font>

359
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,060
you know that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem like hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

360
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,410
internet its architectural<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's way off</font>

361
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really concerned with that will</font>

362
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,319
have impact on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

363
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,970
operations and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely things</font>

364
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,320
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be concerned about and we</font>

365
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,150
did see that echoed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the</font>

366
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,830
security survey responses by some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

367
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,300
folks that were paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention but the</font>

368
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,530
you know the wider operator<font color="#CCCCCC"> pool</font>

369
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,670
definitely needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

370
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,959
those sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it will</font>

371
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,579
have an impact on your business so

372
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,840
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the one thing that I</font>

373
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,210
would most highlight from the survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

374
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,350
think so um actually there was there's

375
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,850
one other thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should mention</font>

376
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,360
when Craig<font color="#E5E5E5"> went over the the law</font>

377
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,100
enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> referral slide is as we went</font>

378
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,510
further sort of down market if you will

379
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,100
with some of the survey response we got

380
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,770
more smaller survey respondents turned

381
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,180
by the referrals to law enforcement one

382
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,439
of the reasons that<font color="#CCCCCC"> number is really low</font>

383
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,969
it's much lower than I thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

384
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,460
be is because most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the operators</font>

385
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,080
don't see it as their obligation to

386
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,940
notify law enforcement if one of their

387
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,800
customers gets attacked they usually

388
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">contribute data or assist in any way</font>

389
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,209
possible but they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually notify</font>

390
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,979
law enforcement themselves they might

391
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,780
work with a customer on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so as</font>

392
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,700
you get more insights they may engage

393
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,630
more law enforcement and there are a lot

394
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,100
of comments about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

395
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,500
effectiveness a law enforcement and so

396
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,180
forth is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Craig alluded to but anyway</font>

397
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the one of the reasons why that's</font>

398
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,839
such a low number is because the ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

399
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,270
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport providers don't see it</font>

400
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,070
is a responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> / say to you know to</font>

401
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:49,569
engage law enforcement directly on

402
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:51,710
behalf of the customer so anyway so the

403
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:55,400
link was on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess if you</font>

404
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,690
wrap it up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survey so if you know</font>

405
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,760
if you have comments or there are things

406
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want in next year's edition of the</font>

407
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,700
survey or things you like or you don't

408
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">like her so forth and we certainly</font>

409
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,030
welcome input in the question said it's

410
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,860
huge number of questions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it usually</font>

411
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,810
takes you know 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 45 minutes just to</font>

412
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer the survey so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly think</font>

413
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,500
the folks that took the time to respond

414
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,360
to this as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

415
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,800
useful from a general feel of the

416
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet as opposed to empirical data</font>

417
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,689
associated with some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks or</font>

418
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,689
not so
