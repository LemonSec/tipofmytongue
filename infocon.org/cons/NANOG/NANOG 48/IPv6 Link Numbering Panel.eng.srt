8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:30,419
take a look at some of our options RFC

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,790
4291 says that all interfaces should be

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,030
numbered from / 64 is nothing smaller

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,760
that's the status quo but as it turns

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,730
out people aren't actually doing that in

13

common common undesirable behavior in

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,880
that I have seen I use that myself and

61
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,280
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that in a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

62
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:27,880
discussions on mailing lists and even in

63
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:29,140
some yes sure so 112 prefix length is

64
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,019
something that I've seen in a number of

65
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,470
appearing links and discussions so I

66
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:36,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought it might be useful to to try to</font>

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,359
describe all the reasons that that might

be that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are using that so it is a</font>

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,930
popular non standard size<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

70
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,780
found someone from University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,819
Pennsylvania put their v6 address plan

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,400
online and that's a fairly typical

73
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:54,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are using 112 in</font>

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:59,530
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> address planning I think by far</font>

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:02,470
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting or useful thing</font>

76
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,120
about 112 is that it's not 64 and the

77
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,560
consequence of that is that on all

78
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,420
platforms that I'm aware of that

79
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,819
suppresses router advertisements and

80
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,589
auto configurations and in certain

81
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:15,429
environments such as router links and

82
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:22,810
even links with some servers that's very

83
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:24,669
desirable 112 is a obviously 16 bits so

84
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,560
that gives you quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font>

85
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:32,280
flexibility not just for point-to-point

86
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,280
links but for excuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

87
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,349
you've done that before it came up here

88
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,360
so that does so 16 bits is enough to

89
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:46,969
number anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can imagine from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

90
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,439
routers on a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to more than two</font>

91
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:51,439
routers on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet segment which is</font>

92
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,509
fairly common or with verb which is very

93
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">common in static routing environments</font>

94
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:58,310
and even server segments I've used it on

95
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:01,370
server segments and it works great so

96
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,039
you can have one one size instead of

97
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,629
having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mix-match of 126 is here 64 is</font>

98
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:10,240
there you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick one size that's</font>

99
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:10,240
useful for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different activities</font>

100
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:19,279
so why 112 and not 114 or some other

101
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:21,289
random length between 64 and 128<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

102
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,939
it's because it lines up on the last

103
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:25,310
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> and boundary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have some very</font>

104
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:27,879
convenient numbering conventions if you

105
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,020
choose to allocate them sequentially

106
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,500
this allows you to have things like

107
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,840
colon 14<font color="#E5E5E5"> router one callin 24 red or two</font>

108
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's 16 bits you could even</font>

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,500
do some more creative things if you had

110
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,599
a unique number assigned to each router

111
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,669
in your network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could make the link</font>

112
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:46,940
ID the last whatever we call them hex

113
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,529
tets or duo octet you could make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

114
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,500
unique router ID so it would be calling

115
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:53,089
126<font color="#E5E5E5"> and colon 14 you know which exactly</font>

116
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,770
which two routers just by looking at the

the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address one benefit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the small</font>

118

119
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,409
that you can number<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of your loop</font>

120
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,258
backs and all of your internal links out

121
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:07,779
of a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> size 64 which could be</font>

122
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:12,110
useful for things like control plane

123
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:13,250
policing and rate limiting ACLs you also

124
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,169
have the flexibility of course of

125
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,180
allocating the mon / 64 boundaries which

126
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:19,878
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know that the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> members of the</font>

panel advocate for their particular

128
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,770
designs and there's another reason you

129
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:29,089
can't do that but it looks like most

130
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:30,859
people do 112 sequentially and the last

131
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,389
one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little tongue-in-cheek because</font>

132

it's whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk about efficiency</font>

detailed discussion of that but that's

146
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
true obviously there's 16,000 possible

147
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,130
address it's certainly a lot fewer than

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,110
64 but that could still be enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

149
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:25,690
break things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm rob c strim and i admit</font>

of addressing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the KISS principle it</font>

158
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:54,520

00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:59,320
here of being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineer for human</font>

machines than four people as sort of the

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,449
default and we have the ability now that

166
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:19,419
we have ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tons and tons of IP</font>

168
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:25,690
breathe slowly to conserve air perhaps

169
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:29,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">we ought to allocate ipv6 addresses in a</font>

170
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,990
way that uh that makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

171
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,829
people than four machines and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put</font>

172
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,719
something that looks sort of like

174
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,620
and it's intentional that's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

175
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,089
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on from the</font>

179
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,060

180
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">mixed together and if you have subnet</font>

181
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,959

on different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interfaces that's</font>

192
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,619
going to talk about this in more detail

193
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:27,319
as that actually there's difference

194
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:29,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the allocation and the</font>

195
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:32,179
configuration that you put on on your

196
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:34,790
box and you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be allocating bigger</font>

197
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:37,220
pieces with the notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that someday you</font>

198
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,349
might want to have /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 s everywhere and</font>

199
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,569
to preserve that option because really

200
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,859
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to prove you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need</font>

201
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:49,248

possible ipv6 address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have but</font>

203
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:53,749
allow yourself the flexibility of doing

204
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:55,939
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future while today working</font>

205
00:09:53,749 --> 00:10:00,309
around various vendors shortcomings by

206
00:09:55,939 --> 00:10:00,309
putting longer prefix on your interfaces

207
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:08,899
waste not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want not we already covered</font>

208
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:11,269
that whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do one of the things</font>

209
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> horribly violates the</font>

210
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:18,199
keeping it simple for humans is having

211
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:20,839
your subnet allocation beyond anything

212
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:22,910
other than a nibble boundary because

213
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the symbol that humans are seeing</font>

214
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,600
we're not we don't work in binary we

215
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:31,989
work in larger symbols there an

216
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:35,799
aggregation of those binary values I

217
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:35,799
stole the slide from Ron

218
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:57,340
I'm eager and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present an</font>

219
00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:00,240
alternative to 60 fours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 112 s that</font>

220
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,650
we've rolled out in production<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves</font>

221
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,370
so first of all what's wrong with 64

222
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,840
well in theory nothing well maybe

223
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a bunch of things wrong of why</font>

224
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,320
do we actually need 64 bits of host

225
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,490
address space but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship has sailed a</font>

226
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:18,220
long time ago so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it go</font>

227
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:21,070
unfortunately in practice that's there's

228
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,730
a big gap between theory and standards

229
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:26,800
and hardware implementation and the

230
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:30,030
whole let's put 60 for everywhere is

231
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,709
actually can cause operational problems

232
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,540
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the problems Ron mentioned</font>

233
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,030
that there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping-pong problem on</font>

234
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,819
sonet/sdh links this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

235
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,550
entire semantics behind sonet/sdh is I

236
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,430
get a packet if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a dress for me</font>

237
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,620
and it's for the subnet that's the is a

238
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign that sdh link I shouldn't even look</font>

239
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,500
at what it is if I just forward it on

240
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:55,600
well given the example if one cider is

241
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,280
calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero the other side is calling</font>

242
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,820
one and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet for colon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

243
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,620
well call them<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero hey that's not for</font>

244
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,090
me send a two column one home 1 hey

245
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,140
that's not for me send it right back to

246
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:12,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">colon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you typical TTL could be either</font>

247
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:15,430
64 255 and you might have got in a

248
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:19,750
packet amplification of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 250 x it's</font>

249
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:22,569
pretty easy to us after isn't the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

250
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,070
issue is the pink sweep of death and it

251
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,420
doesn't need to get think sweep could be

252
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:30,120
a packets push<font color="#E5E5E5"> acts and you name it</font>

253
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,560
assuming the link type is ethernet and

254
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:38,520
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> address plan is above if</font>

255
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:42,310
somebody you know hits double<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colin 345</font>

256
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,140
deadbeef whatever every time I router

257
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,359
get something to an unknown address it's

got to perform an NDP welcome the entire

261
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:56,380
basically dealing with four billion

262
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:59,589
squared + DP lookups it can't actually

263

perform that look up for Colin one the

268
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:15,040
protocols in general in the router break

269
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:19,300
your network may be in the about to melt

270
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,810
down so yes these are implementation

271
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,579
issues these are hardware-specific

272
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:29,469
unfortunately their present in every

273
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:31,569
vendor that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had seen so again is it</font>

274
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,220
really the fault of 64 that you know

275
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,980
it's a standard know it's a fault of

276
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,990
implementation but we are network

277
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,399
operators our job is to make things<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:45,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this does not work so the question</font>

279
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,140
have been yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

280
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,579
work on the 64 came a workaround

281
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,410
differently than changing the address

282
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:53,769
structure some people have proposed

283
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:56,680
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACLs you know you put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a CL zaboor</font>

having to manage an ACL / interface for

288

every interface in my network is just

not scalable given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it has to be</font>

you fix it unfortunately the 42 min

296
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:29,800
because something is program with your

297
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,810
hardware how long's that you spin the

298
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,760
basics get to your router's every five

299
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,819
years every seven so what do you mean

300

say well if you resolve this ntp address

before then we resolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it should get</font>

priority over looking up a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

305
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,990
that's great that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I believe it</font>

306
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,190
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right way to address it</font>

307

unfortunately you ask a vendor for a new

315
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,389

<font color="#E5E5E5">otherwise</font>

317

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we do it well as Robert</font>

321
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,268
mentioned there's a difference between

have to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I like your solution</font>

the best of all these so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

356
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,040
which I'm surprised actually RS didn't

357
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,190
mention which is regional aggregation

358
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,109
off the top or bottom of your blocks for

359
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,760
numbering loop backs into your separate

360
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,319
regional space rather than aggregating

361
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,170
all of your loop backs globally into the

362
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:23,270
same space what what you pull from from

363
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,980
where and and how you number loop backs

364
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,720
was sort of outside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope of what we</font>

I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other point that wasn't</font>

368
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:35,540
mentioned which is quite useful for or

369
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,610
pro reason for using<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64's is software</font>

370
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,490
that you have you store v4 addresses in

371
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:43,129
today if you happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast five</font>

372
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:48,170
integers so four octets and a netmask a

373
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:51,050
standard in cast of 11 size are 11 digit

374
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:53,720
integer you can easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> store your assess</font>

375
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,460
/ 64 is this decimal instead of hex in

376
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,690
those exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> same spots and then just</font>

377
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,670
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if it's greater or less</font>

378
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:03,680
than 32 and don't have to rewrite your

379
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:07,850
software too much fair enough by the way

380
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:11,540
if if you are supportive<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the / 127</font>

381

the draft after this meeting sure and

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,320
one one last point another reason to

390
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,530
support Igor suggestion is I've now seen

391
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:40,220
two vendors implementation for NM<font color="#CCCCCC"> esas</font>

392
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:42,560
where they auto aggregate on / 64 so

393
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,440
your links turn into a big single the

394
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,540
lot of links and while that's a software

395
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,040
support issue it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still what's in</font>

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:53,860
implementation today thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you middle</font>

I listened to somebody else and I did /

converted to an ipv6 it's you know it's

405
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:17,090
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn it into a hex versus a</font>

everybody on my team to say hey I know

411
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,669
the ipv4 what's the ipv6 and it's a

412
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,920
simple one so i would just advocate that

it has a little bit of the keep it

414
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,470
simple and it has a little bit of the

00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:02,180
correlation into the network side of the

424
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,230
subnet and at that point you know as

425
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,970
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you put the courage and the</font>

427
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:11,540

00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,909
go the less of a ping-pong and

429
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,110
amplification and NDP attack you open

430
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,460
yourself up to so if you go with a 126

431
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:23,149
you know multiplication factor of two

432

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> so bad you go with the 124 that goes</font>

also the Summoner router<font color="#CCCCCC"> anycast ever</font>

there's an important disclaimer

that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not attempt to eat a /</font>

524
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,928
or you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of control plane</font>

525
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,900
pleasing or other policy configuration

526
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:48,020
management perspective you at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

527
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:50,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to keep your / 64 is continuous and and</font>

528
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,070
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you minimize that policy so that</font>

529
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,260
at 3am your argument holds from that

530
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:57,200
perspective as well so well again you

531
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,900
could just allocate all the 64's out of

532
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,760
the symbol 48 yeah no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree i'm saying</font>

533
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,530
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sure you would want to have that</font>

534
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,030
for the backbone wings in a way but you

535
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,428
definitely want him to be continuous so

536
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:09,678
may hold it away that argument or

537
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oracle's more likely the bottom 48 for</font>

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">a temptation or a risk when you're doing</font>

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,179

543
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,040
figure but allocating on<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64bit</font>

544
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,600
boundaries to do that where you may have

545
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,889
mixed and matched like the throw

546
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,570

547
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:32,330
careful and disciplined about how you're

548
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,590
assigning it whereas with other sizes if

549
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,240
you're going sequentially with 112

550
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,409
you're not as likely to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

551
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,880
you probably aren't going to use those

552
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,880
with 30 many customers

553
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,430
well cognizant of the fact that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

one thing standing between you and lunch
