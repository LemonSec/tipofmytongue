00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,910
hi there so I'm kind of curious how many

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you in this room have already played</font>

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,240
with ipv6 ipv6 routing most of you going

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,029
to say what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing here but so</font>

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,520
anyway I serve on phonica and myself

6
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,350
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> presenting this I am NOT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Philip</font>

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,380
Smith he couldn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there was a</font>

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,010
conflict with me nog so since<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,538
configured<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 routing like in</font>

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,669
2005-2006 I figured I could fill in<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,480
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're needed so Long's with</font>

12
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:39,089
juniper I'm with myself used to be at

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cisco years and years ago and anyway I</font>

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,610
guess we'll get started look I'm Ron

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">bonica we're gonna be painfully honest</font>

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,899
with you at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning of this talk</font>

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,700
American I've never given this talk

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,550
together before so we have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,940
well it goes but what we're going to do

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,989
is make believe for a minute that she

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,968
and i work for a fictitious<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp we'll</font>

22
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:08,899
set up our website at fictitious mad or

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,900
whatever and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to activate</font>

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:14,729
ipv6 for the first time we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,979
routers from brand<font color="#E5E5E5"> j and brand see so</font>

26
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,270
we'll show you some examples we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

27
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,140
some other problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to</font>

28
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,380
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with on day one so let's</font>

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">leap into this exercise and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess we</font>

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,500
have two problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> right off the first</font>

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem is configuring aren't well we</font>

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,090
don't know which problem is first one

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,189
problem is configuring our network come

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,409
closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the microphone okay one</font>

35
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,110
problem is configuring on it too loud

36
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay one problem is configuring our</font>

37
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,759
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other problem is coming</font>

38
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,040
up with an addressing plan and which one

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">do you think we should tackle first oh I</font>

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,100
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the addressing plan</font>

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">because how do I even go about getting</font>

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,949
an ipv6 address that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and</font>

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,000
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very lucky she said that because</font>

44
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,260
those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first slides in the</font>

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,660
presentation

46
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:10,110
go figure well that's light doesn't

47
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,310
matter that<font color="#CCCCCC"> much topics and goals well</font>

48
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:18,300
what do you know we touched on that

49
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:23,190
erratic<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggressive well you're going to</font>

50
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some ipv6 address space and you</font>

51
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:30,210
know that stick<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty well already from</font>

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,690
ipv4 the same rirs that dole out fee for

53
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:36,270
address space<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhola v6 address in space</font>

54
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:40,400
the one difference between the two well

55
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:46,680
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people but you'll notice</font>

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:49,320
very different responses when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

57
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask for address base ask for v4 a big</font>

58
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,209
chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of v4 address space and you'll</font>

59
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,829
meet the pit bull here ask for v6

60
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:01,640
address space and they're very happy to

61
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,640
accommodate you by the way that's Rocco

62
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so so anyway all the regional</font>

63
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,810
registries you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get an ipv6 address</font>

64
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,390
from there are some slight deviations in

65
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,190
terms of policies because there's still

66
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,809
that controversy that's been ongoing for

67
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,700
the last oh I don't know at least eight

68
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,700
years that I've been hearing about it

69
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,459
about whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not you know a / 32</font>

70
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,130
allocation from an RR is big enough too

71
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:31,670
much too little should it be / 56 you

72
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,769
know what should people do so there's

73
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,320
they're still controversy and you know

74
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,970
ongoing policy issues and if you're

75
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,769
actually interested in this I would

76
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,870
encourage you very strongly to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

77
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,250
whatever region your and I would imagine

78
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,350
most of you are here in the air in

79
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,200
region but some of you that may have

80
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">traveled from other areas you know if AP</font>

81
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,720
neck or or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whiteboard or lack Nick or</font>

82
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">AfriNIC is is where you're from then I</font>

83
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">would encourage you to actually</font>

84
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">participate on some of these policy</font>

85
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,760
discussions you know besides the rirs

86
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,490
you can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> get address space from the</font>

87
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,649
upstream isp if you're a smaller ISP or

88
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:12,410
you could also use 64 in fact that's

89
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,840
fairly important medica and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I are</font>

90
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,209
assuming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're both at isp so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd</font>

91
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,209
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR how many of you</font>

92
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:27,830
folks are representing enterprises and

93
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:29,480
not is BS about what half<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right</font>

94
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,930
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just shows a picture of the</font>

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:37,740
different internet registry

96
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:40,560
registry regions so in terms of getting

97
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,419
ipv6 address space if you're not a

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">member of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP should become a</font>

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,490
member of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your regional internet</font>

100
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:49,860
registry and get your own allocation

101
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,020
basically all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ipv6 allocation</font>

102
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,210
policies that are current and also some

103
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,940
proposals are all documented in each of

104
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:00,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are websites if you're an</font>

105
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,360
existing ipv6 resource folder some IRS

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,699
give you ipv6 just on the quest I EAP

107
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,470
Nick so just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of history on</font>

108
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,289
that right i mean there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a lot of</font>

109
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,090
encouragement from the IRS to get people

110
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,969
to actually start playing with and

111
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,698
deploying ipv6 and while there's still

112
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,470
some notion that it's only you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 128</font>

113
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,539
bits in terms of addresses that's it

114
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,060
nothing more<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think those of you that</font>

115
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,070
have actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> actively been using it and</font>

116
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,610
deploying it know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know there's</font>

117
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:31,620
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other considerations actually</font>

118
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,770
there is plenty of ipv6 address space

119
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,930
and most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rars actually do require</font>

120
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:44,430
high quality documentation in terms of

121
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:48,060
how you actually use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

122
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:51,659
can also get ipv6 addresses from the

123
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,630
upstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> is P so typically you get a</font>

00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:57,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">slash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 48 from the upstream</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isp and you</font>

125
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,630
can get more than once last 48 if you

126
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,630
have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 65,000 subnets so just as</font>

127
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:06,300
an aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually worked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

128
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,460
connections by bowing in 2005-2006 and

129
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,659
they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boeing itself had gotten their</font>

130
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:15,870
own / 32 and we were very actively

131
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:19,229
playing with it I actually had a BGP

132
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:22,380
going live with NTT and this was

133
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:23,460
December of 2005 and from what I

134
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,069
understand we

135
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,310
the first / 48 as an enterprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> that got</font>

136
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:31,020
routed by ntt<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was told by some people</font>

137
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">later that they absolutely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hated me</font>

138
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,198
because it you know started this in

139
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:41,970
engineering internal discussion to put

140
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:44,970
it mildly right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you know the</font>

141
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,669
key is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just really start using it</font>

142
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:52,259
most of you have said in here that you

143
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:54,719
have so you know get and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a an</font>

146
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:04,948

147
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,750
and really for simple testing purposes

148
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:11,610
it's much better if you actually get

149
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:13,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">your own v6 allocation and how 624</font>

150
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,099
addressing works you basically take a

151
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:20,639
single ipv4 / 32 and then you insert

152
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:24,030
that after the 2002 colon<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter that as</font>

153
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:28,229

154
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:31,739
your / 48 subnet it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> requires a 64</font>

156
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,849
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more about this as well</font>

157
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,799
let's have some funny questions right

158
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,560
now kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know hedging the bets</font>

159
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,830
against our retirements if I had been

160
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">around 30</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have snarfed</font>

161
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,500
up a few / aids and I would have kept

162
00:07:52,770 --> 00:08:01,620
them in my pocket until there was value

163
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:04,560
later given that ipv6 address space is

164
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,220
so large I probably don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play</font>

165
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that game</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this time do I I wouldn't why</font>

166
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,430
don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't very nice person now</font>

167
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:17,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is what I probably there's</font>

168
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,169
no economic benefit in that I don't

169
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,180
think so<font color="#CCCCCC"> because in the world of / 48</font>

170
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,320
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are an awful lot of / 40 aids in</font>

171
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,320
the ipv6 address space

172
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so in terms of address blocks for</font>

173
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:42,500
our outer loop back interfaces generally

infrastructures as last 48 allows for

179
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:04,580
65,000 subnets typically there is a / 48

backbone and summaries summarizing

182
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,339
between these sites really<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense</font>

183
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:16,100
now you know every six months I either

184
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:20,810
watch the v6 ops mailing list that's run

185
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:23,300
out of koonet de or na nóg list and you

186
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,949
know the thread there's a similar threat

187
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,479
all the time in terms of you know what

188
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:30,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of allocations do you actually use</font>

189
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,500
for your subnets so mostly what we're

190
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,140
describing here is what makes reasonable

191
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,089
sense and and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know again I didn't</font>

192
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,949
create these slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philip actually does</font>

193
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:42,020
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these tutorials especially</font>

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,459
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are basically allocations that</font>

both him and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ron believe are the most</font>

198
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,969
reasonable there are some variations you

199
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:58,939
know and I still remember doing a survey

200
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,520
in 2006-2007 why ask people so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do</font>

201
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,760
you use and I asked five different

202
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:08,150
people and I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> five different answers</font>

203
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,370
so but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if what I would</font>

204
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,650
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do is also take a look</font>

205
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,080
at some of the threads from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog</font>

206
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,910
list that and I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year</font>

207
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,580
though there's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least two of them</font>

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last 12</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months about</font>

209
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,900
what do you actually use how do you

210
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:30,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">allocate your your your address space</font>

211
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:34,699
adequately now aside from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that</font>

212
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,310
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a / 48 you have room for 65 k</font>

page if you and I decide we like 49

216
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:51,439
better than 48 the retro accommodated

217
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:54,650
just like right at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the</font>

218
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,589
bigger routers will so one of the things

219
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,020
also to actually look at is some of you

220
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,000
are and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different</font>

221
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,520
networks you're not just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know using</font>

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,150
cisco juniper stuff so if you're looking

223
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:12,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">at CP devices which also now become in</font>

224
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:15,520
warm or ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware i would also look to</font>

225
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,520
see what they do

226
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,670
Oh

227
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,580
another two more pieces of addressing

228
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:32,870
guideline first what about the land is a

229
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,650
recommendation here for a / 64 / well

230
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:39,350
this is even more than a recommendation

231
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:41,880
is from RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 / 64 per subnet pearl and</font>

232
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next question is much more</font>

233
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,420
controversial and I think it's on

234
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tuesday we're going to have a panel to</font>

235
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,020
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this let's say you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

236
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,300
point-to-point link between two routers

237
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,980
how should you number that well

238
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,089
strangely enough the current well I

239
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,020
shouldn't say strangely but the current

240
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:01,650
recommendation is to use a / 64 that

241
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,390
seems a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit wasteful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a subnet that</font>

242
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:06,630
will never have more than two end points

243
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,400
on it what's more it leaves you to

244
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:12,230
several security vulnerabilities that

245
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:16,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more on Tuesday so</font>

246
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:19,220
if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at advice coming out</font>

247
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:22,350
of the IETF today they're saying as / 64

248
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:26,460
lots of people using 126 is some are

249
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,530
using 127 s some are using a pair of 128

250
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:32,040
on a real point-to-point link some

251
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:36,630
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> use 112 because it accommodates</font>

252
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,010
reverse dns lookups nicely other people

253
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,590
using all sorts of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so we'll</font>

254
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:43,260
discuss really what the right thing to

255
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:46,770
do is on Tuesday and this on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

256
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,350
and I'd like a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font>

257
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,060
present their input we'll put it

258
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,410
together and send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF as a</font>

259
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,410
recommendation from operators

260
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:07,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so if you're an ISP by basically a</font>

261
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:10,200
customer would get a / 48 unless they

262
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:14,100
have more than 65,000 subnets in which

263
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:17,700
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a second / 48 but some ISPs</font>

264
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,950
alter distributing / 56,000 / 60s as

265
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,390
initial customer assignment because they

266
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,940
feel that let's say it's a small

267
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:27,420
customer you know / 48 is actually quite

268
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,400
a bit of address space so your mileage

269
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,500
may vary and you know there's still

270
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite a bit of controversy actually and</font>

271
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:38,100
what what to give out traditionally it's

272
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:42,240
been as last 48 but I I personally have

273
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,520
actually seen a lot of /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 sixes for</font>

274
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,290
the customer the<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressing plans I mean</font>

275
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,460
they should not be reserved or signed on

276
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,949
a per pop basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> is P ibgp carries</font>

277
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:56,250
customer networks there's aggregation

278
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:58,640
within the internal bgp is not required

279
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:01,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually not desirable and</font>

280
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,839
aggregation and ebgp is very necessary

281
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,670
right one of the biggest issue is

282
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,830
actually facing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet as a whole</font>

as more and more be six starts though

00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,910
it's getting utilized is how do the

285
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,209
routers actually handle the routing

286
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,730
tables and you know we'll we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how</font>

287
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,320
that all progresses and I can't remember

288
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:24,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">now with the size of the routing table</font>

289
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:28,740
is in v6 I think it's about 16,000

290
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:32,010
ebuddy actually know how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2700 okay so</font>

291
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,300
right now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2,700 you know bgp</font>

292
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp routing table entries and</font>

293
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,250
summarization is definitely really

294
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,250
important in aggregation

295
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,790
ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

296
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:56,499
I guess this is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of our</font>

297
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:59,389
addressing assignment we aggregate

298
00:14:56,499 --> 00:15:02,720
windows on aggregate we assign 1 / 64

299
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:04,850
for our loot bags oh I'm sorry this is a

300
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,040
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our addressing strategy we</font>

301
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:14,110
signed 1 / 64 for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our loot bags to say</font>

302
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:14,110
we said we would we have four side we

303
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:23,180
whereas my cursor we assign this chunk

304
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:31,128
for infrastructure and this bit for

305
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:35,209
customer assignments yeah so since most

306
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:37,759
of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have deployed some ipv6</font>

307
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:39,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would imagine that most of you have an</font>

308
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,069
addressing plan what I'm kind of curious

309
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:46,759
about is that if you're an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP how many</font>

310
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:52,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not give us last 48 out to</font>

311
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:56,569
your customers not what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give out</font>

312
00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:02,769
you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and the rest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you I mean</font>

313
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:05,319
how many of you do give out of / 48<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

314
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:06,699
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to a total of three people</font>

315
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I saw a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more hands at the</font>

316
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,949
beginning of this I guess some of you

317
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:13,600
were enterprises<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

318
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:20,349
let's ask the question again how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of</font>

319
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:23,860
you either give or receive a 48 that

320
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:27,970
were that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes how many of you give or</font>

321
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:35,799
receive something smaller just the one

322
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:38,369
for this all right so it really depends

323
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,369
on who their customers

324
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:50,120
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean as you'll note I mean</font>

325
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,939
there's there's the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

326
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,710
established years ago right are really

327
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the process of saying you know these</font>

328
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,510
policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> I meanwhile we think that ipv6</font>

329
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,940
has a lot of adverse base there's still

330
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little bit of a notion by some people</font>

331
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,339
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be careful</font>

332
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how we allocate things so we</font>

333
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,958
actually don't run out you know I I

334
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,760
don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have done</font>

335
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,760
this I was actually stupid enough to

336
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,829
create spreadsheets for all of the last

337
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:24,439
60 fours it was a lot of numbers you

338
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,419
know and my co-workers were like why are

339
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you doing this and I you know after like</font>

340
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,970
a day I said you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know but</font>

341
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,250
it kind of proved to myself that really

342
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,530
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of numbers there but you</font>

343
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,780
do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some kind of sensibility</font>

344
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,120
in terms of how you actually allocate at

345
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,770
the space right but I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

346
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,409
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> as concerned as maybe some</font>

347
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are well we're being numerical</font>

348
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:54,470
how many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever gone back to</font>

349
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:58,760
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR for a second / 32 didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

350
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know a what you have and the</font>

351
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,000
direction

352
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:08,990
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

353
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">law is empowering</font>

354
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,870
so right now choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

355
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,470
so that

356
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:35,139
email servers are but it all works from

357
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:39,820
a network there at the security of

358
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,820
support if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go under</font>

359
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,429
well this particular session is more

360
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,950
about routing right and actually doing

361
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,050
ipv6 routing and you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely</font>

362
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,510
correct i mean we know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i configured</font>

363
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,030
in 2005 i was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much happily</font>

364
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,110
surprised that it really just worked the

365
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,570
stuff that didn't work was the

366
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,520
management stuff right or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font>

367
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:08,419
actually security personnel or that's

368
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,460
abysmal but so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really discussing</font>

369
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,130
the addressing plans in terms of more

370
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,940
from a routing perspective and form

371
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:19,430
actually the core network Jake did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

372
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,450
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem hi I'm just curious how</font>

373
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,060
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you people are actually</font>

374
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:26,380
filtering ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> route to secular edges</font>

375
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:31,929
and if so what size are you filtering on

376
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,930
good question what are you filtering on

377
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,290
so you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a minimum</font>

378
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:02,299
mar lazing or frontier communications

379
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,459
and I'm on the air and AC I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

380
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:07,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">hijack your presentation because it's</font>

381
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,790
good and but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic of addressing</font>

382
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,830
and routing is actually a big issue

383
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,750
right now with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin policy and there</font>

384
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:18,409
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been proposals put forward that</font>

385
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:20,120
will dig into this even deeper and can

386
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">really screw with routing if they pass</font>

387
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,010
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't get people like you at</font>

388
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting to vote on it because it</font>

389
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,750
actually is addressing what filters<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

390
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,190
be your response kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really keep me</font>

391
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,790
up because you said you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing what</font>

392
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,200
the rirs are saying well if you keep

393
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,090
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these policies</font>

394
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,140
pass we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have serious issues</font>

395
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:44,629
so it's a great topic I'm sorry I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

396
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to hijack anything but the subnet</font>

397
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,309
boundaries and filtering is it is

398
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,080
important and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people need to</font>

399
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:53,510
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yes already tables are getting</font>

400
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,309
large filtering kind of does need to be

401
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,169
done but we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be conscious about</font>

402
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:59,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">not blocking off things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming</font>

403
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:02,030
which is very much in danger and in

404
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:03,890
traffic engineering is in danger<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks</font>

405
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,360
yeah no I'm actually glad you made<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

406
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,309
comment because it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

407
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,709
emphasizes what I had mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier</font>

408
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,750
that you know if you can and are really

409
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,900
interest in them please participate in

410
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:18,640
the RRS you know addressing policy

411
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,640
issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> controversies</font>

412
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,570
speaking of addressing policies actually

413
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:32,249
Marla can confirm this<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not if you</font>

414
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:34,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever run out of your first / 32 when you</font>

415
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,389
reserve the first one the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RA are</font>

416
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:40,460
reserved a second one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so you'll</font>

417
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:43,019
get to do we not do that anymore well

418
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,779
that's one of the proposals that would

419
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:48,509
change that which I see is a problem

420
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:51,840
because it proposes that now you can

421
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:54,359
only get 1 32 and you can qualify<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

422
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,459
one of the other subnets but there for

423
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">the whole reservation fact goes away</font>

424
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,029
well then you're doubling your routing

425
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:05,519
so ya know it right now it is but it may

426
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:07,259
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple months if people</font>

427
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,509
don't speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> out against it actually I</font>

428
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,649
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you your comment</font>

429
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:15,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">is probably a little more interesting</font>

430
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:17,309
than our talk so if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could ask him if I</font>

431
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,980
could ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you don't want to being</font>

432
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:21,480
put on the spot if you could run through

433
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,779
quick bullet points of the dangerous

434
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,749
proposals and I don't have the names of

435
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,190
the memory sorry I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use cheat</font>

436
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:33,299
sheets i'll confess<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use them like</font>

437
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:38,489
crazy and but there's two specifically

438
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:40,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it involves addressing and what is</font>

439
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:42,989
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be proper addressing just to</font>

440
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:46,679
try and maintain control and not waste

441
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:49,200
and however it's getting into routing

442
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,259
because there's proposals one is saying

443
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,109
hey let's make 48 only come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of this</font>

444
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:58,230
chunk here and 30 tues only come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

445
00:22:55,109 --> 00:23:01,639
this chunk here and so on and if you do

446
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:03,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you've now in a way classified</font>

447
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:07,309
addressing and made it possible for

448
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:09,779
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to filter out certain subnets and</font>

449
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:11,879
some people might look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a good</font>

450
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:13,830
thing in some might look as bad you

451
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:15,928
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> look as bad because you have a</font>

452
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:21,359
smaller subnet let's say you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

453
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:24,299
larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp and they have a large super</font>

454
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,340
net themselves and they only want to

455
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:27,869
mess with<font color="#CCCCCC"> their own routes they don't</font>

456
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,519
they don't want all these as many

457
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:31,230
customers coming to me with I've got my

458
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,960
own address space please route it here

459
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,880
please route it

460
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,070
instead we want to go hate here's ours

461
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,350
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for multi-homing get your other</font>

462
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">eye speed provider to route it as well</font>

463
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:43,000
and you're good to go but if you start

464
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,610
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> these boundaries where you can</font>

465
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,100
filter then you start running into

466
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:51,639
roadblocks oh I might not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

467
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:55,000
actually give my customer a / 48 and

468
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,950
have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-home Marlowe so kids it</font>

469
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,510
came out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 32 I want to see if you</font>

470
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,650
really understand something like you

471
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,450
said at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of the comments</font>

472
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:04,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's actually kind of a return</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to class</font>

473
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,370
full addressing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

474
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:09,040
way it's it that's why I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

475
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">that word because it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of its</font>

476
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,240
classifying groups but it's not

477
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,890
classifying it in the same way<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

478
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">abused me let me make that clear it's</font>

479
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,240
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't any</font>

480
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,340
bits that indicate the class but if you

481
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,750
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at address an address by</font>

482
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,220
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that address and looking at</font>

483
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:29,740
some other table you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for certain</font>

484
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:31,450
it's a / 48 right and it yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

485
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">see so there's there's that and that</font>

486
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:37,630
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause I mean that could there is</font>

487
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,990
no multihoming solution for v6 and this

488
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:42,910
solution is networks just do it and let

489
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,640
it work however if there's policy like

490
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:47,580
that now we've got a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

491
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,620
roadblocks in the way of letting at work

492
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,060
and some people on the other side might

493
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,739
go hey great because when the routing

494
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,379
tables won't grow too much well that's

495
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,450
really not the case because you keep

496
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,060
hearing people say it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 141 their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

497
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,250
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to change their</font>

498
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,470
addresses when they go to a different

499
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:08,410
provider but and that's a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

500
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,300
topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hear ya but I'm doing it all the</font>

501
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:14,920
time that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do and it works it's</font>

502
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:18,580
okay but you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have just as many</font>

503
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,710
routes so it's it's not putting those

504
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,810
separations there and saying this is out

505
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:26,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this block is just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put more</font>

506
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:28,419
more roadblock set for networks and

507
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,950
operators are going to struggle trying

508
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get their customers up to let them do</font>

509
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,880
multi humming I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think i</font>

510
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,670
babbled yeah

511
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,150
you yet you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> added lots of value</font>

512
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:44,780
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey yeah all right Jake and</font>

513
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:47,360
then we're gonna continue so this kind

514
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,020
of brings to mind a question then is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

515
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:55,300
Ernie<font color="#CCCCCC"> rir is working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs answer</font>

516
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:58,070
to sort of specify a good policy for

517
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:01,480
using array our allocations for

518
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:05,360
filtering is that a is that a goal here

519
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,010
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a goal that there is no bcp yet</font>

520
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,649
there were people at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last night nog</font>

521
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,950
and that stood up and said hey I'd be

522
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:15,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">great to do and then or as a group that</font>

523
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:18,380
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of went to dinner and I heard</font>

524
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:20,540
anything come out of it so no no one's

525
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,920
taken ownership for it it's not on the

526
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,340
Charter for Aaron it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on the</font>

527
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:29,030
Charter for Nana and should it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the</font>

528
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:31,159
Charter for v6 ops maybe so wrong maybe

529
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,420
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should do that I'd be perfectly</font>

530
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,400
willing to put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the Charter if</font>

531
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,020
somebody would say I would help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you with</font>

532
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:41,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually you'd be glad to be there</font>

533
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:45,379
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay anybody care to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Your</font>

534
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:48,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">Honor I heard and so to answer the</font>

535
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,310
question no not right now

536
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,940
smaller

537
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,610
that

538
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:46,459
well I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

539
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:50,300
the tail wag the dog or the dog wagging

540
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:52,160
the tail maybe operators should be you

541
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,460
know writing their filtering policies

542
00:27:52,160 --> 00:28:02,920
and letting the vendors do what the

543
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:05,240
operators need rather than by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I</font>

544
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:10,130
didn't say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i work for a vendor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

545
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:11,809
anyway by the way would you to get in

546
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:18,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">touch with each other so you'll know to</font>

547
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:23,300
work together<font color="#CCCCCC"> and okay we talked about</font>

548
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:25,450
registry is document let's say you at

549
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:29,149
this point how much time do we have our

550
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:34,040
talk right now should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we move on to</font>

551
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:35,500
configuration let's do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what do you</font>

552
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font>

553
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:47,800
how convenient ok can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> pose a question</font>

554
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:52,870
related to documentation please are

555
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:57,389
there some rirs that actually are easing

556
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,389
up on the documentation requirements for

557
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">critics is allocated to customers</font>

558
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,940
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have had something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

559
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,739
but I've yet to verify this information

560
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:15,400
well that's it that's it it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

561
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:17,350
question for<font color="#E5E5E5"> mala so are there some rars</font>

562
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,720
that actually have eased up the

563
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:23,230
documentation requirements of IP version

564
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:27,790

I'm aware of that has very liberal

00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:44,200
non-existent justification is APNIC all

570
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,220
the other ones have been still requiring

571
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,930
it and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a little a little</font>

572
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,770
more loose because we don't know what to

573
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:57,010
expect and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one camp saying you</font>

574
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:59,410
can IP address every grain of sand on

575
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:02,890
the earth but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at history</font>

576
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:06,340
it repeats itself and there's a finite

<font color="#CCCCCC">numbers again be six so we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">just open the floodgates and say hey</font>

581
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,840
still justification required and that

00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,880
the heir and Regent I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only speak</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly the extent of that will be as</font>

time goes on I can't answer because I

588

don't I don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> crystal ball de</font>

611
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:44,910
we've got all our addressing policy at

612
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:47,140
least as clear as it's going to get with

people kicking off<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs so now it's</font>

616
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,070
time to start configuring a router and I

617
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,809
guess the very first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we should do</font>

618
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:03,909
is on our iOS routers tell the router

619
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:06,879
that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do v6 and the way to</font>

620
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:09,280
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so to enable ipv6 on a</font>

621
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,980
cisco iOS router you basically have a

622
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:15,928
goal global command which is ipv6

623
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:18,400
unicast routing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

624
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:20,800
enable Seth because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> on by</font>

625
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:25,300
default and you just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by the</font>

626
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:28,480
command command ipv6 f you would also

627
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:30,168
want to disable<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 source routing</font>

628
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,720
right just with as

629
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:36,350
I pee before you just really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need</font>

630
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and you would say no ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

631
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:41,928
sprouting if some of you have followed

632
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:43,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">this for a while right with ipv6 you</font>

633
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:46,700
have this issue with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing header</font>

634
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:51,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero and it's actually been the cause of</font>

635
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:54,590
some some well security issues if you

636
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,988
will and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so with no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 source routing</font>

637
00:32:54,590 --> 00:33:05,629
it just turns off using the routing

638
00:32:56,989 --> 00:33:08,179
header<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 for iOS XR routers ipv6 is on</font>

639
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:12,649
by default so that's different than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

640
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:17,359
iOS configuring interfaces on either iOS

641
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:19,100
or iOS XR you do an interface under the

642
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,239
interface command you just say ipv6

643
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:26,539
address unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> the address and prefix</font>

644
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:29,179
you can also do an automated eui-64

645
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:31,580
based ipv6 address but typically this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

646
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:32,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">really nobody uses its own routers right</font>

647
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,570
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally you want to know what</font>

648
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:37,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">the actual ipv6 addresses but if for</font>

649
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,139
some reason you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did want to use that he</font>

650
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:43,999
was just under the interface say ipv6

651
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:46,340
address the prefix and then eui-64 and

652
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:50,029
that would then take the mac address and

653
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:55,488
create an EU<font color="#CCCCCC"> I 64 based ipv6 globally</font>

654
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:56,570
unique address so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one of the</font>

655
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:58,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that I'm going to point out here</font>

656
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">now is that I have seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

657
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,049
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually play with their ipv6 they</font>

658
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:04,609
just kind of turn it on sometimes you

659
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:06,109
don't have a test router so you actually

660
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:08,179
would just see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens if you</font>

661
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:10,639
enabled it on your production<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

662
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:12,379
and what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fascinating to me</font>

663
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,290
was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have you know your</font>

664
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:17,480
ssh access for ipv4 and your filters and

665
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:21,079
all that and you totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot to do</font>

666
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:23,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for ipv6 so because you enabled</font>

667
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,609
ipv6 now when your routers and had

668
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:28,549
access with interfaces that means that

669
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:30,159
if I just kind of knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your ipv6</font>

670
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:32,379
allocation was and happened

671
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">no what your interface address might</font>

672
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:37,868
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might try to SSH into it you</font>

673
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:40,960
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's you know you want to at</font>

674
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:45,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">least put in this same kind of control</font>

675
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,500
plane filters for your ipv6 to make sure

676
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,629
that no miss between traffic kind of

677
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,710
gets at it so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just kind of</font>

678
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,779
interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

679
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,220
actually in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of environments and in</font>

680
00:34:52,780 --> 00:35:02,200
some environments that really should

681
00:34:54,219 --> 00:35:06,069
have known better so just a caution<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

682
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:09,549
and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> for configuring ipv6 on your</font>

00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:13,058
<font color="#CCCCCC">junos routers system-wide it's on by</font>

684
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:16,420
default what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is something</font>

685
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:18,760
slightly different as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are defining</font>

686
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,109
an interface as always you need to

00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,299
define<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have interfaces on the</font>

688
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:25,930

interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> fe 300 in this case you need</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to define a logical interface on it unit</font>

691
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:37,630
0 all this you would have had to do

692
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,549
whether it were v4 or v6 had this been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

693
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:43,569
v4 interface you would have said family

<font color="#E5E5E5">I net address and a v4 address in this</font>

695
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:50,288
case it's family inet6 address and a v6

696
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:51,789
address you could have turned them both

697
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:54,490
on if you wanted it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a dual stack</font>

698
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:56,920
interface have one stanza that says

in fact there's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and you</font>

702
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:19,910
saw eui-64 syntax in iOS iOS XR same

syntax here in junos that's what the

704
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:24,640
address blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ey 64 is about</font>

705
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:32,329
and let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back in cisco</font>

706
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:35,359
land that's kind of both basic don't you

707
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:39,049
yeah so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

708
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:41,058
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> both the name server and syslog</font>

709
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:43,509
have been made<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work in both the iOS</font>

710
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:46,489
and journals routers to go over the ipv6

711
00:36:43,509 --> 00:36:48,289
transport so as there was a comment

712
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:49,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier before right the routing works</font>

713
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:51,440
but some of the network services are

714
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,319
still things that are work in progress

715
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,900
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is true but for both you nose</font>

716
00:36:54,319 --> 00:37:00,469
and iOS actually named server and syslog

717
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,809
can be accessible VoIP<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 and these here</font>

718
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:05,269
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> commands that would enable that</font>

719
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:10,940
so for iOS you would say IP name server

720
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:14,959
and put in the ipv6 address and well the

721
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:16,700
other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 same thing for iOS</font>

722
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,130
XR you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually use domain name</font>

723
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:23,868
server as the key command and then

724
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:25,069
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> junos configuration yes just</font>

725
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:27,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorta jump back to interface</font>

726
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:30,710
configuration some people may be

727
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:33,859
configuring interfaces on to a public

728
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:35,299
exchange or to a peering point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

729
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:37,038
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that certain distance ones have</font>

730
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:39,109
certain criteria<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or third</font>

731
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:42,009
requirements for interface configuration

732
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:45,710
586 I don't know anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here from</font>

733
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:48,469
constrictor exchange with operator<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

734
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,759
kid can you maybe touch upon some of

735
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:52,390
those special requirements like they

736
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:52,390
were discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

737
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,060
yeah this fight is basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

738
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:34,520
mentioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier that when you're</font>

739
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,440
actually enabling ipv6 on a platform be

740
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:40,730
aware that IP access to the control

741
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:43,910
plane is now<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible via ipv6 right so</font>

742
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:46,910
make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do your control plane</font>

743
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:50,629
filtering also on ipv6 as well as ipv4

744
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:52,730
and you know it's it's something that

745
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,470
isn't in the slide set but what Mike

746
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:57,440
just mentioned actually regarding

747
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,870
turning off neighbor discovery and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

748
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,570
you know router advertisements typically

749
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:05,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your peers you know you don't</font>

750
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">need router advertisements and router</font>

751
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,550
solicitations so it's usually on by

752
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:13,130
default on the interfaces so from a

753
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:15,620
router the router<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer connection you</font>

754
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:19,550
want to disable that now how many do not

755
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:21,470
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I figured</font>

756
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">since most of plague I mean you do know</font>

757
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,680
this

758
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:36,260
okay so yeah so also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you guys are</font>

759
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:39,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">seem to be pretty familiar with ipv6</font>

760
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,540
which is great note that configuring and

761
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:44,630
an ipv6 address you will have both

762
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:48,110
global and in unique local ipv6 address

763
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:52,360
and also a link-local ipv6 address which

764
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:56,210
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fe ad colon colon interface ID so</font>

765
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:59,270
the link local address is basically

766
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:02,090
config constructed by comparing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fe</font>

767
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:05,210
80 with the interface ID as soon as the

768
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,820
ipv6 is enabled so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

769
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:10,730
actually shows that so from a cisco

770
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,520
router if you do ipv6 unicast routing so

771
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:16,190
you're enabling ipv6 when you do a show

772
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,500
ipv6 interface it will show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

773
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:21,010
have a link local address that's

774
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,030
automatically generated and

775
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,830
automatically you're already part of a

776
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of group addresses like the all</font>

777
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,630
voters address and some others

778
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:37,470
you can also look at the interface

779
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:43,830
status and basically this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

780
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:45,810
output would look like and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

781
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:47,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the show is what it would be on the X</font>

782
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:52,230
our router how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you are using X</font>

783
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:59,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routers here is anybody just a few</font>

00:40:52,230 --> 00:41:06,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and this is similar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> output</font>

785
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:09,210
for in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Geno's now we've brought up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

786
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:11,400
interfaces probably pinged across

787
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,850
interfaces and said yep that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

788
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,220
it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring up a routing protocol</font>

789
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:22,740
or not or you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do static routing</font>

790
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:24,390
so true so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully you're not doing</font>

791
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:28,049
this hopefully you're doing you the ospf

792
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:29,580
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice or PGP but if if you wanted to</font>

793
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,230
play and you know he needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

794
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,799
static route maybe to a customer

795
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:36,810
actually then the configuration command

796
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:42,360
is very much like in before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's ipv6</font>

797
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:45,900
route but the ipv6 prefix prefix length

798
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:49,680
ipv6 address interface type a number and

799
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,630
then an administrative distance so this

800
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular example shows that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

801
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:57,390
routing packets for<font color="#E5E5E5"> network 2001</font>

802
00:41:53,790 --> 00:42:02,880
deviates last 64 so 64 subnet to a

803

with an administrative distance of 110

805
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:10,589
and for those of you that may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

806
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,560
this by the 2001<font color="#CCCCCC"> db8 is a documented</font>

809
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:21,360
rather than a subnet that might be live

810
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,550
somewhere so<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime you actually do any</font>

811
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,970
documentation the presentation please

812
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">also use a 2001 db8 /</font>

813
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:31,580
two quick quick question regarding

814
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:34,070
statics 4v4 i use a null hold down route

815
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,660
for my allocation and that just is the

816
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,910
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm used to configuring bgp to</font>

817
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,500
announce that large hold on do you need

818
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:43,520
to do the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as V 6 i'm assuming you</font>

819
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:46,010
do question in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in junos landed it works</font>

820
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,970
in cisco lid<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe the same is true</font>

821
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:52,280
but i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to validate so anybody</font>

822
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:56,618
yeah a<font color="#E5E5E5"> six they're using null hold down</font>

823
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,619
alt yeah so sure it translates

824
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,850
so

825
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:26,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

826
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:29,620
the features not quite there yet all the

827
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,330
all the examples you see here when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

828
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,819
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> junos examples it was on an m series</font>

829
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:36,819
router and back then I think it might

830
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:43,720
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> Geno's 76 or something like</font>

831
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:48,190
that ok for static routing this is the

832
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:49,839
command for the iOS XR router so

833
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,720
basically have router static address

834
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:56,350
family ipv6 unicast and then you set

835
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:59,290
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> your next hop so this example again</font>

836
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:02,440
it shows advanced packets for the

837
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:05,980
network 2001<font color="#CCCCCC"> DB 864 to a networking</font>

838
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,860

839
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:15,340
80 CC 0 0 1 with an administrative

840
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:18,340
distance of 110 and here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> junos</font>

841
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:23,220
example the first thing that's

842
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:26,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting is where it goes in the</font>

00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,609
a fib

846
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:42,630
and beyond that you'll see it looks

847
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:45,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much like an ipv4 route except</font>

848
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:48,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that it has ipv6 prefixes</font>

849
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,229
in it

850
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:55,549
and here's an actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

851
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:07,040
in fact it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact same example we</font>

852
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:09,410
just saw in iOS land yeah so of course

853
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can also set a default route so in</font>

854
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:15,500
this particular example right you have

855
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,840
the ipv6 unicast routing ipv6 addresses

856
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:20,720
underneath both<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISA Ethernet 0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet</font>

857
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:23,870
one interfaces and then the ipv6 route

858
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,330
colon colon slash<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 the colon colon</font>

859
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:28,520
slash<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 is all zeros which is the</font>

860
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:31,610
default route and then you would enter

861
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the address of the router to ethernet 0</font>

862
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,450
interface because that's the exit

863
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:37,609
interface which would give the default

864
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:39,439
route to route or two so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can already</font>

865
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:42,260
see that actually doing static routing

866
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,450
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an almost a configuration nightmare</font>

867
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:47,990
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you actually have to know</font>

868
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hop ipv6 address so anything</font>

869
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:51,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I've configured it know that you</font>

870
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:56,060
would probably want to avoid it as much

871
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,730
as possible and here's a similar command

872
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:02,720
for XR I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing really unusual</font>

873
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:08,020
interesting here and in the world of

874
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:10,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">junos it's pretty much good of and in</font>

875
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> junos you pretty much would</font>

876
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> guessed what this configuration</font>

877
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,920
looked like from looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous</font>

878
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,919
slide

879
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,110
yeah so for the most part<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean dynamic</font>

880
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:26,050
routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in v6 is really not that</font>

881
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:28,150
different from before I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

882
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:30,070
there are slight configuration nuances

883
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,260
because i know from cisco like the

884
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:36,430
parser police i guess was asleep or just

885
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:39,760
non-existent so but basically how it

886
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:42,390
works it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very very similar so ipv6</font>

887
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:46,540
also has two types of routing protocol

888
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:48,790
internal or external ipv6 still uses the

889
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:52,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">longest prefix match routing algorithm</font>

890
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:54,430
so for I GPS you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> either a rip which</font>

891
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:59,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think a lot of ISPs would even</font>

892
00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:00,399
use you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco eigrp on obvious</font>

893
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:05,740
reasons your neighbor doesn't support it

894
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:09,040
we have ospfv3 and integrated is is for

895
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:11,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">eg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peb sorry EGP exterior gateway</font>

896
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,770
protocols you have the multi protocol

897
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:19,140
bgp for so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

898
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:19,140
multi-protocol for both ipv4 and ipv6

899
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,190
basically what we're saying here is that

900
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,080
you have the same tools in v6 that you

901
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have in v4 sometimes you had to hit</font>

902
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,259
those tools with a hammer a little bit

903
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work in v6 but the same</font>

904
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:36,130
thing I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to point out you can</font>

905
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:40,600
also use our DGP for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp to carry v6</font>

906
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:42,790
routes as well right yeah so bgp can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

907
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,220
an internal or an external gateway

908
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:49,350
protocol so thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> pointing that out</font>

909
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,350
i'll send a note to philip

910
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:55,299
so if you're configuring the routing

911
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:58,810
protocols for iOS<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dynamic routing</font>

912
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:01,090
protocols all require router ID the

913
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,890
router ID is a 32-bit integer and

914
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,420
sometimes people get a little confused

915
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,379
because sometimes it kind of looks like

916
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:10,180
an ipv4 address that's not what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

917
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,760
iOS order generates these from the

918
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:15,700
loopback interface address if it is

919
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:20,560
configured<font color="#E5E5E5"> else the highest ipv4 address</font>

920
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:24,129
of the router becomes the router ID most

921
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,380
isp's will deploy ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> in dual stack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

922
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:29,710
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen any yet that only</font>

923
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:31,900
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 so the router ID will actually</font>

924
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:35,860
be automatically created you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

925
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:38,260
your ipv4 configuration early adopters

926
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,990
choosing to deploy ipv6 in the total

927
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:43,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">absence of any ipv4 addressing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

928
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:46,350
be aware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router ID needs to be</font>

929
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:50,669
manually configured and so for example

930
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:54,100
under ospf we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 router ospf</font>

931
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:57,790
autonomous system 100 the router ID is

932
00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:00,250
10 dot one dot one dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 so again if</font>

933
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:03,130
you're in a dual stack environment then

934
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:05,470
from your ipv4 configuration the router

935
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:08,500
ID will automatically already be created

936
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:11,680
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're doing ipv6 only then you</font>

937
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:14,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to specifically um specify</font>

938
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,680
what the router ideas now I have a

939
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:19,630
question here and by experience as an

940
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,669
operator I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the router ID can</font>

941
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:25,480
be automatically generated but can also

942
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,980
be specified<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the config too and I</font>

943
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">just don't like to put it in the config</font>

944
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,780
for fear of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would happen if one day</font>

945
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,730
had changed somebody put a new highest

946
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,080
address on I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to test</font>

947
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,120
the routers behavior to see if it would

948
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,799
change the router ID or not that's a

949
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:41,140
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> point i'll just put put something</font>

950
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,480
that i know would stay still that's a

951
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,220
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so some people might actually</font>

952
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,020
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there can be</font>

953
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,250
assured that if there's an interface

954
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:52,500
change or you know

955
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,500
that the router ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't actually change</font>

956
00:49:52,530 --> 00:50:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay sorry so for ipv4 routing protocols</font>

957
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:05,680
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> XR order generates the router ID as</font>

958
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:08,680
the following<font color="#E5E5E5"> as per the IRS rules</font>

959
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,799
actually but BGP requires the router I

960
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:14,799
need to be manually configured so the

961
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:19,120
command would be router bgp 2.4 and then

962
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:21,790
set the router ID ospfv3 requires the

963
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:26,230
router ID to also be manually configured

964
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:32,560
so about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ospfv3 and then configure the</font>

965
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:34,480
actual voter ID so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually speaks</font>

966
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,279
to exactly what you were saying and so

967
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,410
with the XR<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get automatically</font>

968
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,470
generated but rather an operator has to

969
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:43,180
say what it is dude<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you know same</font>

970
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:46,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing you can either let the router</font>

971
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:49,750
generate the router ID or specify it

972
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:52,140
explicitly recommend specifying it

973
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,140
explicitly

974
00:50:55,390 --> 00:51:02,470
so rip<font color="#E5E5E5"> next generation basically for any</font>

977
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:11,919
use rip in any form<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless there's</font>

978
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:14,740
absolutely no alternative possibly maybe

use rib at all to a customer site and

981
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:27,939
think so so we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just skip that so</font>

router ID is still the 32-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol</font>

987
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:51,819
still 88 so that didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> change similar</font>

988
00:51:46,510 --> 00:52:00,069
CLI to the ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it started in 12</font>

989
00:51:51,819 --> 00:52:02,288
dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 not an iOS XR yet so so some</font>

990
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:04,599
differences and i will do a caveat<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font>

991
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:08,410
actually never configured eigrp for ipv6

992
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:10,390
i'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> done infos PF is is MV GP but</font>

993
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:13,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">hellos a source from the link local</font>

995
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:20,529

996
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:21,848
group for all AIG FP routers so this

997
00:52:20,529 --> 00:52:25,329
means that the neighbors don't have to

998
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:26,819
share the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same goal prefex okay except</font>

999
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:29,079
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exception of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explicitly</font>

1000
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:32,799
specified neighbors where the traffic is

1001
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:36,400
actually unicast automatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> summarization</font>

1002
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:39,369
is disabled by default for ipv6 so

1003
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,259
that's a difference from ipv4 where it's

1004
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:43,630
actually automatic summarization is

1005
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:47,289
enabled so if you want auto

1006
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:50,769
summarization you will have to enable it

1007
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:54,009
for ipv6 and there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> split horizon in</font>

1008
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:56,839
the case of eigrp for ipv6 because ipv6

1009
00:52:54,009 --> 00:52:59,089
supports multiple multiple prefixes

1010
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:05,089
interface so again that's different than

1011
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:08,558
IP before so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a</font>

1012
00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:13,729
configuration looks very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much like ipv4</font>

1013
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:15,950
where you have just the router eigrp so

1014
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:19,328
enable the eigrp writing process and

1015
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:24,308
under the interface you know enable your

1016
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:26,660
ipv6 address say ipv6 enable and then

1017
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:30,849
put down that that interface actually

1018
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:36,078
participates in the eigrp process so

1019
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:40,489
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same as before if you do a</font>

1020
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,289
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 eigrp neighbor basically the</font>

1021
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:45,339

1022
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:51,140
address right so the fe e ad colon colon

1023
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:53,660
interface ID and and you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

1024
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,400
the right on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom also or in the</font>

1025
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:58,960
middle you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also see the router ID</font>

1026
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,960
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 32-bit integer</font>

1027
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:09,760
okay ospf needed to be changed a little

1028
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:12,990
bit to accommodate<font color="#CCCCCC"> ospf needed to be</font>

1029
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:16,150
changed a little bit to accommodate ipv6

1030
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:20,529
the problem is there are ipv4 packets

1031
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:22,119
embedded in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> OSP v2 protocol and just</font>

1032
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:24,119
needed to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> those packet length issues</font>

1033
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:30,089
so there's a whole new protocol ospfv3

1034
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:30,089
which looks surprisingly like ospfv3 to

1035
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:42,970
its presently like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ospf v2 in these ways</font>

1036
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:44,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ospf for v6 it's based on v2 with a</font>

1037
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:47,470
few enhancements obviously it

1038
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:50,080
distributes v6 prefixes it runs directly

1039
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:52,660
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 the same way v2 runs directly</font>

1040
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:57,369
over before and it ships in the night

1041
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:59,319
with v2 if you have both address

1042
00:54:57,369 --> 00:55:00,880
families activated on an interface

1043
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,380
you're likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have both v2 and v3</font>

1044
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:09,700
running and they won't interact with

1045
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:11,020
each other the protocols are very

1046
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,589
similar they have the base the same

all that good stuff the same mechanisms

1050
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:25,990

1054
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:40,390
a few significant differences ospfv3

1055
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:47,560
runs on a link instead of on a per IP

00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:52,029
this at all or just believes that it

1058
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:55,330
turn it on it works if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't</font>

1059
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:57,130
understand that that point you would be

1060
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:59,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the protocol just as well as</font>

if you did

1062
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:06,980
now let's say there's quite a few here

1063
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:10,960
so we probably should run through<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1064
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:16,430
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit do you want to sure as well</font>

1065
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:20,420
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run 48 yeah so basically ospf three</font>

1066
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:23,450
runs<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a link and server IP subnet in</font>

1067

ipv6 multiple IP subnets can be assigned

1068
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:27,529
to a link and two nodes and different

1069
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:30,650
subnet can actually communicate at a

1070
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:34,930
link layer and therefore SPF is running

1071

/ link and sort of pure IP subnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok an</font>

1074
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:45,529
a link but anyway the more interesting

1075
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:47,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">things to me actually that you can have</font>

1076
00:56:45,529 --> 00:56:52,569
multiple support of multiple instances /

1077
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:57,680
link so you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">OSPF instances running on a link the</font>

1079
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,149
instance ID should match before packet

1080
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:04,190
being accepted and it's useful for

1081
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:10,160
traffic separation to have multiple

1082
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:12,289
areas / link there's also an address

1083
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,140
semantic change in the link state

1084
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:16,970
advertisements so the router and network

1085
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:20,150
link state advertisement carry only

1086
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:21,890
topology information the router link

1087
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:24,980
state advertisement can be split across

1088
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:27,710
multiple link state advertisements so

1089
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,859
link state ID in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link state</font>

1090
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:32,660
advertisement header is a fragment ID

1091
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:34,999
right if you know if you remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1092
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:38,089
for ipv6 you've got a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

1093
00:57:34,999 --> 00:57:42,109
extension headers and so one of them is

1094
00:57:38,089 --> 00:57:44,029
a fragmentation pattern the intro area

1095
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:46,249
prefixes are carried in a new link state

1096
00:57:44,029 --> 00:57:49,249
advertisement payload called in Terraria

1097
00:57:46,249 --> 00:57:51,410
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> lsas and the prefixes are carried</font>

1098
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:53,828
in payload of inter area and external

1099
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,828
LSA

1100
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:01,160
there's also generalization of flooding

1101
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:04,220
scope so in ospfv3 there are three

1102
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:07,580
flooding scopes the link local scope

1103
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:09,980
area scope and autonomous system scope

1104
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:14,060
and they are coded into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LS type</font>

1105
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:17,270
explicitly in ospf v2 initially only

1106
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:23,570
area and autonomous system wide flooding

1107
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:26,810
were defined there's also a difference

1108
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:30,110
in terms of how unknown<font color="#CCCCCC"> LSAs are handled</font>

1109
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:33,380
so the handling of<font color="#CCCCCC"> L essays is coded</font>

1110
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:35,750
here the youbut in LS type when the you

1112

corresponding flooding scope when the

1113
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:45,320
you bet is clear the LSA is flooded with

1114
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">linked local scope and in b2 and any</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">different differentiation between</font>

1121
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,240
this is near and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dear to my heart</font>

1122
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:07,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I always thought this is kind of</font>

1123
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:10,669
really interesting so authentication is

1124
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:12,950
removed from ospf and it was removed

1125
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:16,010
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was PF relies on the ipv6</font>

1126
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:18,200
authentication header since i was PF

1127
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:20,270
runs over ipv6 right and the

1128
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:23,029
authentication errors part of the IPSec

1129
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:27,080
protocol now what I've really found

1130
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:28,880
fascinating is that when ospfv3 was

1131
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,520
first created the assumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that</font>

1132
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,550
all ipv6 traffic would be protected

1133
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">using IPSec and since you don't need</font>

1134
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:38,030
encryption well you just need integrity

1135
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,890
protection well of course you would

1136
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:43,310
implement a<font color="#E5E5E5"> H which is the</font>

1137
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:46,850
authentication header but as the IETF

1138
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:49,520
began to be more explicit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

1139
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:53,180
actually use IPSec in the actual

1140
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,619
standard that was defined ESP null which

1141
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,269
is using ESP the

1142
00:59:54,619 --> 00:59:59,480
does encryption but using null

1143
00:59:56,269 --> 01:00:02,930
encryption no more sand is actually what

1144
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:05,359
must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> H is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may so to</font>

1145
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:07,519
me it's it's kind of funny because<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

1146
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:09,769
vendors you know then shipping ospfv3

1147
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:13,220
which is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for at least six</font>

1148
01:00:09,769 --> 01:00:16,160
seven maybe even eight years all i'll

1149
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:17,779
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ahc authentication header so to</font>

1150
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,249
me it's been kind of interesting you

1151
01:00:17,779 --> 01:00:21,079
know whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not people are going to</font>

1152
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:23,720
start using ESP know and how do you

1153
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:26,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually configure it because it's kind</font>

1154
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,078
of a nightmare

1155
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:39,940
and

1156
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:42,040
this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a almost an</font>

1157
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:44,560
inconsequential change the ospf packet

1159
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:52,320

1161
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:03,940
there's also two new<font color="#CCCCCC"> link-state happen</font>

1162
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:06,160
what what's the acronym stand for<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1163
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:07,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">link state advertisement yeah okay so</font>

1164
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">does yeah so two new link state</font>

1165
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:13,900
advertisements<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been introduced so</font>

1166
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:16,869
the link LSA has a link local<font color="#E5E5E5"> flooding</font>

1167
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:18,790
scope and has<font color="#E5E5E5"> three purposes one is it</font>

1168
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:21,670
provides<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router link local address</font>

1169
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:24,340
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one at this Saul ipv6 prefix is</font>

1170
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:26,200
attached to the link and also thirdly it

1171
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:28,320
asserts the collection of option bits

1172
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:31,089
for the router links that advertisement

1173
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:33,099
the second one there's an intra area

1174
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:35,320
prefix linked site advertisement<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1175
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:41,140
advertise the routers ipv6 address

1176
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:44,170
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> area finally what you've been</font>

1177
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:48,210
waiting for how do we turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on it very</font>

1178
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:51,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">similar to ospf v2 in the cisco routers</font>

1179
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:57,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you just prefix any existing</font>

1180
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:59,770
command with ipv6 and with the info

1181
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,310
interfaces that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly configured</font>

1182
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:05,259
you just replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network command and</font>

1183
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:08,680
basically the native ipv6 router mode

1184
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:11,650
it's not a sub mode of router ospf so

1185
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:13,480
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be yeah so here is</font>

1186
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:18,400
actually entering the router mode you

1187
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:20,740
say ipv6 router ospf process<font color="#CCCCCC"> i key and</font>

1188
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,010
then configure the area under the

1189
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:27,310
interface so ipv6 ospf process ID what

1190
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:31,060
area belongs to and then in exec mode

1191
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:34,150
you can do either show ipv6 ospf process

1192
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:38,849
ID that will show you the information or

1193
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:38,849
do clear ipv6 ospf process ID

1194
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:46,110
so there's some specific ospfv3

1195
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:48,900
attributes so configuring an area of

1196
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:54,060
range and you do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the area</font>

1197
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:57,450
enter the area ID the range and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

1198
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:59,640
prefix and prefix length showing the new

1199
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:03,180
link state advertisements you do a show

1200
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 ospf process ID and either database</font>

1201
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:09,419
link or database prefix and then you

1202
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:13,350
configure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on occasion by just saying</font>

1203
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:21,840
authentication ipsec spi 256 md5

1204
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:26,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">password so this is basically what a</font>

1205
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:27,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">configuration would look like I don't</font>

1206
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have any comments under this</font>

1207
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:35,010
looks very much like ospf be to do a

1208
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:39,259
show ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> route you see that you know</font>

1209
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what the ospf would look like</font>

1210
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:51,029
you could also do ospfv3 and do ipv6

1211
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,070
tunnels over ipv4 so how you would set

1212
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:57,030
that up is you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> create an interface</font>

1213
01:03:53,070 --> 01:04:01,940
tunnel on each router no IP address or

1214
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:05,600
no ipv4 ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> address just enable that</font>

1215
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:10,800
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ipv6 link local address</font>

1216
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:12,410
specify the router ospf area<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 and then</font>

1217
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:16,050
create a tunnel source and destination

1218
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:21,710
with your ipv4 addresses and the tunnel

1219
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:25,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">mode ipv6 and ipv6 router ospf 1 and</font>

1220
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:27,390
then do a similar command on router to

1221
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:33,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually you know have it be the</font>

1222
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:36,720
other endpoint tunnel endpoint in these

1223
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:39,210
commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> here how you actually configure</font>

1224
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:41,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was pfn on the X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our router you have</font>

1225
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:45,330
your comment quick operational question

1226
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,760
for anyone here I use ipv4 anycast for

1227
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:49,700
my core DNS servers so I have multiples

1228
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,260
of them in different regions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the u.s.</font>

1229
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:55,439
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I implement that with quagga</font>

1230
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:58,200
using ospf to advertise its last 32 to

1231
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,810
my upstream routers using an ospf not so

1232
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:05,660
stubby area has anybody done that sort

1233
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:09,680
of thing with v6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> os exactly the same</font>

1234
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:09,680
awesome thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you yes</font>

1235
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:13,790
and

1236
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:22,680
we're like the last the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last bid is the</font>

1237
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:25,859
port number or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something sure cool</font>

1238
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:28,319
that's really good idea yeah thanks for

1239
01:05:25,859 --> 01:05:30,240
that I mean my observation also has been

1240
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that from the routing pieces I mean</font>

1241
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:35,490
there's really very little that's

1242
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:37,140
different from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 ipv6 there are some</font>

1243
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,750
nuances right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as we just went</font>

1244
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:41,819
through also with ospf<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and three I</font>

1245
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:44,789
mean there's some enhancements if you

1246
01:05:41,819 --> 01:05:46,109
will that we're done with ospfv3 but if

1247
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:48,270
you look at actually how you configure

1248
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:55,140
it but there's really not that much

1249
01:05:48,270 --> 01:06:00,000
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to go over the</font>

1250
01:05:55,140 --> 01:06:01,710
XR<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so for the XR these are</font>

1251
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,109
just configuration examples i'm not

1252
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:08,089
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through them in detail okay</font>

1253
01:06:04,109 --> 01:06:10,619
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to do it in junos land</font>

1254
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:12,359
that stands at protocols which should

1255
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:15,180
look vaguely familiar to you it's

1256
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:19,319
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same configuration that we</font>

1257
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:23,520
would use in ospf be to accept we say

1258
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:26,609
ospf<font color="#E5E5E5"> three and we're done show ospf</font>

1259
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:28,770
three is the equivalent of show ospf and

1260
01:06:26,609 --> 01:06:31,980
you have all the same options database

1261
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:36,440
interface I of statistics clear ospf

1262
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:36,440
three exactly the same as clear ospf

1263
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:44,999
um

1264
01:06:41,799 --> 01:06:44,999
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's a</font>

1265
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:54,279
no differences from iOS I guess the

1266
01:06:51,809 --> 01:06:57,930
issue that medica talked about with the

1267

work on refining the pragmatics of the

1276
01:07:25,569 --> 01:07:30,069
security in routing protocols it's

1277
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:32,769
called carb keying and authentication

1278
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:34,058
for routing protocols we know that most

1279
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:35,258
of you have implementations which

1280
01:07:34,059 --> 01:07:36,910
support this they've just been<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

1281
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:39,039
about the authentication support and

1282
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:41,170
that most people either don't bother

1283
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:43,599
turning it on or never change the keys

1284

and security that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you turn on and never</font>

address a number of known issues and one

1288
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:59,199
of them is should we replace the aah

1289

with a specification to use the SP null

1290

is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO 10 589 standard specifies OSI</font>

is is routing protocol for cl NS traffic

1350
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:44,760
there's tlv options to enhance the

1351
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:48,270

1354
01:11:50,969 --> 01:11:59,070
architecture RFC 1195 added IP support

1355
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:02,540
so is is runs on top of the day a link

1356

1357
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:11,250

family support to is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and RFC 5120</font>

1359
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:19,020
defines multi topology concept for is is

1360
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,940
one on nice point about is is is that

1361
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:24,060
you only have to run one protocol

1362
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:26,639
instance for actually to have IP v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1363
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:28,500
ipv6 running so you don't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1364
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:33,420
two instances of the routing protocol

1365
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:36,750
like you do with ospf so is is for ipv6

1366
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:40,050
you have to tag length values attitude

1367
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:44,040
to do this ipv6 routing you have the

1368
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:46,130
ipv6 reach ability tlv external bit

1369

1371
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:55,910
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipv6 interface address</font>

1372
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:58,940
type length value for hello pdus<font color="#E5E5E5"> must</font>

1375
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:12,880

configuration example for cisco iOS so

1378
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:23,510
for router one you have interface

1379
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:27,800
ethernet one have an ipv4 address and

1380

ipv6 address specify both for IP which

1381
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:35,300
is ipv4 by default and then ipv6 that

routing configure router is is

01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:50,090
address-family ipv6 here he wants to

1387
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:52,610
redistribute static and then you

1388
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:57,220
configure an exit adverse family and

1389
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:57,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">redistribute static for ipv4</font>

1390
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:09,230
you can also configure is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours for ipv6</font>

1391
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:12,300
by doing an ipv6 tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> over ipv4 same</font>

1392
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:16,730
same basic configuration applies us for

1393
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:20,450
ospf where you just define an ipv6

1394
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:22,889
global address a link-local address

1395
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:25,139
specify that you want to run router is

1396
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:32,090
is and then have a tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> source and</font>

1397
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:35,460
destination be the ipv4 addresses and

1398
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:38,310
this year is just configuration commands

okay here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the juniper equivalent</font>

1402
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:59,400

1403
01:14:56,219 --> 01:15:02,729
have an interface that is configured

01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:08,268
with family<font color="#CCCCCC"> inet so it can have an IV</font>

1405

for address-family iso and family inet6

1406
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:17,789
then we turn on protocols again

1407
01:15:12,209 --> 01:15:22,289
redistribute statics and put all those

1408
01:15:17,789 --> 01:15:27,360
interfaces and dices and we have some

1409

policy options let's say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will</font>

accept anything from static

1411
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:39,589
again the same tunneling that we could

1412
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:40,790
do with ospf we can do with Isis and in

1418
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:06,770
skip over multi topology yeah I think

1419
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:10,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only point that we should make on</font>

1420
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:11,690
the multi topology is is is that there

1421
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:14,330
might be an assumption initially that

1422
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:17,330
you have the same topology for ipv6 as

1423
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:19,250
you do in ipv4 but if you don't if you

1424
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have a different apology for</font>

1425
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:24,890
your ipv6 and is is that's why this

1426
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:30,320
multi topology extension was actually

1427
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:31,820
created so okay we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming down the</font>

those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the two relevant RFC's</font>

we have new optional and non transitive

optional and<font color="#E5E5E5"> non transitive optional</font>

the problems is that in the in for using

01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:44,169
redirects right i mean you're restricted

1475
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:51,250
to using the link local address so it's

1476
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the global unique address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

1478
01:19:54,220 --> 01:20:00,010
let me be a little bit more pragmatic

1479
01:19:55,900 --> 01:20:02,740
here reason we went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> both is because</font>

1480
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:06,370
people ended up with some errors if they

1481
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:08,889
had one or the other now an intelligent

you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make either one work</font>

1484
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:17,920
and I I that's probably the best way to

1485
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:19,960
give why we have both that if you don't

1486
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:24,510
have both there are cases where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1487
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:27,010
hang yourself most intelligent

1488
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:29,020
configurations don't hang themselves is

1489
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:32,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">that otherwise i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get down into the</font>

1490

1491
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:37,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you I mean do if you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1492
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:39,100
to go to the Wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> weenie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moments I</font>

1493
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:40,810
will but otherwise i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">preventing it sorry to put you on this</font>

1495
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:44,470
now and here's a difference with ipv4

1496
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:46,780
right with IP before you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1497
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:49,450
next top you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an IP address right</font>

1498
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:52,150
with ipv6 the next hop is either your

1499
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:54,910
global a unique address or also your

1500
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:58,950
link local address and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1501
01:20:54,910 --> 01:21:03,430
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of confusion to some people</font>

1502
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:09,880
yes if I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything there k yes</font>

1503
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:12,910
I think I'll let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it go I mean I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

1504
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:17,590
there's a one exception but we'll take

1505
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:19,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that offline and I'm I if there are</font>

1506
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:21,550
questions I'm glad to answer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1507
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:25,830
also cognizant of getting we've gone

1508
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:25,830
into the weeds on this four times

1509
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:31,139
because people have had problems and

1510
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:35,980
again most of the problems occur with

1511
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:41,190
non-standard topologies in an exchange

1512
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:46,419
point or three hops into the XJ having

1513
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:50,679
exchanges that go across perhaps layer

1514
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:52,600
to transparent stuff so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go</font>

1515
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,700
on with that I can but otherwise yes

1516
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:58,000
okay i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really though</font>

1517
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:59,889
that you know with ipv6 you do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1518
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,710
be aware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know every interface</font>

1519
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:04,360
does have a link local address and then

1520
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:06,940
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's up to you to actually</font>

1521
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:09,670
configure a also a globally unique

1522
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:13,389
identifier and when you're looking at

1523
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:15,760
bgp right as a slide here says when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1524
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:18,670
have two pairs on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same subnet your</font>

1525
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,680
next hop information is formed by using

1526
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:23,020
either right I mean it's either the

1527
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:25,030
globally unique identifier but also that

1528
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:28,240
link local so when you're actually

1529
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:29,679
starting to you know configure bgp and

1530
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:32,260
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP routing</font>

1531
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:34,540
tables I mean you know don't don't be

1532
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:37,300
too confused with the fact that your pub

1533
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:40,510
I see both right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be safe you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

1534
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:42,760
both the Japanese<font color="#CCCCCC"> have successfully</font>

1535
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:47,440
proved you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> link local if you're</font>

1536
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:49,390
careful but in all of this for tutorial

1537
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:51,190
please use both you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably won't shoot</font>

1538
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:53,530
yourself if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to singly</font>

1539
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:55,330
linked local come talk to people who

1540
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:57,570
done it so you don't shoot yourself in

1541
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:57,570
the foot

1542
01:22:58,489 --> 01:23:01,539
that's fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> too okay</font>

1543
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:16,810
and the slide is

1544
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:23,239
fairly self-explanatory there's one rib

1545
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:26,770
per protocol ipv6 has its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp table</font>

1546
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:26,769
you'll see that in the show commands

1547
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:35,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">can this again addresses what we're just</font>

1548
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying before that the next hop contains</font>

1549
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:41,320

1554
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:02,320
same as wouldn't be for bgp runs over

1555
01:23:59,889 --> 01:24:04,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">tcp this connection could be set up over</font>

1556
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:09,579
v4 or v6 bgp doesn't know one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1557
01:24:04,989 --> 01:24:11,589
another router<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs when no router ID is</font>

1558

configured an explicit<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp router ID</font>

1559
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:18,789
needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> configured generally good</font>

1560
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:21,730
practice to configure it anyway the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

1561
01:24:18,789 --> 01:24:26,199
identifier is a 32-bit integer currently

1562
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:28,030
generated from the router ID this is

1563
01:24:26,199 --> 01:24:30,400
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp identifier it's used in</font>

1564
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:37,870
the open message and in tiebreakers for

1565
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:42,290
bgp best path<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1566
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:45,440
oh here we go again there are two

1567
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:49,220
options for configuring bgp peering one

1568
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:50,839
is to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> link local addressing do this</font>

1569
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:54,890
only if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like staying awake late at</font>

1570
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:56,480
night and debugging others to use global

1571
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:58,760
unicast addressing which is what you

1572
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:01,040
would have done in v4 do this if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1573
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,870
like going<font color="#CCCCCC"> home to see your family yeah</font>

1574
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:05,780
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean since you</font>

1575
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:08,090
know I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as a replacement to</font>

1576
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:10,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">Philip I can only guess that the reason</font>

1577
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:11,989
that you know these slides are in here

1578
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:14,750
and talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing in</font>

1579
01:25:11,989 --> 01:25:18,530
multiple forms is because it will really

1580
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:21,260
bite you at some point<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so basically</font>

1581
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:24,440
it is not recommended to use the link

1582
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:27,770
local addressing right and I mean the

1583
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:30,469
recommendation to actually set your next

1584
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:32,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">hop is to use global unicast addressing</font>

1585
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:35,050
I think it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make life a lot</font>

1586
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:35,050
simpler

1587
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:57,300
ok so in iOS routers basically it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1588
01:25:55,080 --> 01:26:00,030
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> did by default assumes that all</font>

1589
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:03,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP neighbors will also be ipv4</font>

1590
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:05,759
unicast neighbors so you have to remove

1591
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:09,660
this assumption and how you do this you

1592
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:13,740
enter the router bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS number no bgp</font>

1593
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:15,570
default ipv4 dash unicast and if you do

1594
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:18,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">not do this this will result in all</font>

1595
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:20,219
neighbors being defined as ipv4 unicast

1596
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:23,070
neighbors it's not necessarily a good

1597
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:25,470
thing because non ipv4 neighbors will

1598
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:28,019
have no specific unicast ipv4

1599
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:33,720
configuration and it just ends up in

1600
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:38,480
cluttered configurations so to actually

1601
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:43,770
create BGP peering<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I iOS router a</font>

1602
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:46,259
under router bgp one router bgp tunnel

1603
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:49,860
system number you say no bgp default

1604
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:52,770
ipv4 unicast and then what the neighbor

1605
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:56,490
is and here as a good citizen of course

1606
01:26:52,770 --> 01:27:00,000
he's using the global global ipv6

1607
01:26:56,490 --> 01:27:02,929
address and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> remote autonomous</font>

1608
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,570
system too and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then address family ipv6</font>

1609
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:08,820
neighbor the neighbor address activate

1610
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:14,660
and then which network you want to

1611
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:14,660
advertise which is the 2001 DBA<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 / 48</font>

1612
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:21,300
so you do not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do link-local</font>

1613
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:24,530
peering again we're beating<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fourth</font>

1614
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:29,970
to death some more they use global

1615
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:32,340
addressing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send Phillip a</font>

1616
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:35,370
note how many different ways can you say

1617
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:39,450
the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow we can show the</font>

1618
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:42,570
picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of rocky yeah so and this is</font>

1619
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a configuration snippet for iOS XR</font>

1620
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:48,059
and I haven't configured an XR but I

1621
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,650
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the real important point</font>

1622
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:53,400
here is that you need inbound and

1623
01:27:49,650 --> 01:27:55,530
outbound route policy because the iOS XR

1624
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:58,110
does not announce or accept prefixes

1625
01:27:55,530 --> 01:28:06,330
without any policy which is really

1626
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:08,670
really nice here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> junos</font>

1627
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:12,570
configuration again we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> out by</font>

1628
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:16,740
configuring an interface that is v6

1629
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:18,570
capable we configure a static route that

1630
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:23,070
we're going to distribute we configure a

1631
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:29,059
routing router ID and we turn on

1632
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:29,059
protocols bgp it doesn't know if it's

1633
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:39,769
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP trucking around v4 or v6</font>

1634
01:28:36,429 --> 01:28:48,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the local a s is one then we have a</font>

1635
01:28:39,769 --> 01:28:54,619
group of neighbors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we call a s2 we</font>

1636
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:57,650
have a export policy for it export but

1637
01:28:54,619 --> 01:29:00,820
we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an export policy for exploit</font>

1638
01:28:57,650 --> 01:29:03,920
static you'll see that in a little bit

1639
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:09,489
it will be a s number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the neighbor</font>

1640
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:12,289
has an address 2001 DBA blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah</font>

1641
01:29:09,489 --> 01:29:15,348
up above we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what the export</font>

1642
01:29:12,289 --> 01:29:18,619
policy was so here we have to actually

1643
01:29:15,349 --> 01:29:21,230
say what it is policy options policy

1644

1645
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:28,129
protocol static<font color="#E5E5E5"> then accept everything</font>

1646
01:29:22,909 --> 01:29:32,860
else rejected this looks an awful lot

1647
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:32,860
like just plain old BGP configuration

1648
01:29:32,889 --> 01:29:38,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay this particular example next couple</font>

1649
01:29:35,719 --> 01:29:42,559
of slides are basically comparing the

1650
01:29:38,929 --> 01:29:46,070
prefix lists and filters for ipv4 and

1651
01:29:42,559 --> 01:29:49,369
ipv6 and what you will notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1652
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:52,549
ipv4 prefix filters and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipv6 prefix</font>

1653
01:29:49,369 --> 01:29:55,759
filters are exactly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1654
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:57,980
exception that you have the ipv6 you

1655
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,710
know keyword rather than IP and of

1656
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:04,339
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you either permitting or denying</font>

1657
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:07,159
ipv6 addresses and there's also a

1658
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:14,079
configuration sample for ipv4 and ipv6

1659
01:30:07,159 --> 01:30:14,079
on iOS XR 41 106

1660
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:19,809
yeah you'll have these slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean w</font>

1661
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:21,699
up on the mailing list and with the iOS

1662
01:30:19,809 --> 01:30:24,429
XR you'll just note that the parade<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1663
01:30:21,699 --> 01:30:27,039
family configuration / neighbor and the

1664
01:30:24,429 --> 01:30:28,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefect sets are similar to iOS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prefix</font>

1665
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:32,518
lists but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no distinction between</font>

1666
01:30:28,989 --> 01:30:32,518
ipv4 and ipv6

1667
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:51,980
and here we've done the exact same thing

1668
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:56,870
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> junos we have a dual stack enabled</font>

1669
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:58,849
interface fe 300 we have a rib inet6 we

1670
01:30:56,870 --> 01:31:02,450
also have inet 0 which is there by

1671
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:08,750
default we've given it a router ID we've

1672
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:11,870
turned on bgp and we have two groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1673
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:16,430
neighbors one group of neighbors in a

01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:21,710
s20 another<font color="#CCCCCC"> naas 30 and we have some</font>

1675
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:23,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy for each yeah this next slide</font>

1676
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:27,740
actually just shows the fact that you

1677
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:29,750
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also do a route map and set local</font>

1678
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:33,769
preference to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you</font>

1679
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:37,190
yourself defined right and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

1680
01:31:33,770 --> 01:31:40,670
the same as you would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ipv4 so</font>

1681
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:44,480
under the adverse family ipv6 right you

1682
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:46,510
set a route map from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASM to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and then</font>

1683
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:49,730
you create the route map from a is to

1684
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:52,480
permit<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 and then set local preference</font>

1685
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:52,480
to 120

1686
01:31:54,780 --> 01:32:00,420
here's a similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> configuration for iOS</font>

1687
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,420
XR

1688
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:08,170
but really manipulating any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1689
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:11,830
attributes in BGP the commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1690
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:15,990
almost identical in ipv6 as they are 5p

1691
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:15,990
before in iOS and iOS XR

1692
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:29,010
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys probably getting tired of</font>

1693
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:31,440
hearing is say this is how you do it

1694
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:34,770
this is how you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in junos but here</font>

1695
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:41,940
again is the identical configuration in

1696
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:43,860
junos and in this case the attributes

1697
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:50,429
were manipulating our local preference

1698
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:54,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you see them in the policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

1699
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:58,140
can also carry ipv4 inside ipv6 peering

1700
01:32:54,390 --> 01:33:01,320
and so for the iOS for the example what

1701
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:04,440
you do under address-family ipv4 you

1702
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:07,349
basically define a route map ipv4 in and

1703
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:14,639
the route map would set the IP next<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop</font>

1704
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:18,470
to be your ipv4 address so there's

1705
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:18,470
another example for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our router</font>

1706
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:31,750
and it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in junos</font>

1707
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:35,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp is you know rides over IP whatever</font>

1708
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:38,870
that rides over<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and the BGP payload</font>

1709
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:42,440
can actually carry any family of address

1710
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:45,019
and it doesn't care if it's you know v6

1711
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:46,969
of dress / v four or before address / v6

1712
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:53,450
or some other quick kind of crazy

those at your leisure yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean again</font>

1716
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:05,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that really the only</font>

1717
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:08,930
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> from ipv4 to ipv6 is that you</font>

1718
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:10,340
use the keyword ipv6 like an IP before

1719
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:13,520
you don't have to use anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1720
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:16,160
just say show bgp unicast parameter but

1721
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:22,700
for v6 you have to actually say show bgp

1722
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:23,870
ipv6 blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> in junos there's a</font>

1723
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:25,840
display command one thing that's

1724
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:31,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting is it shows you each rib</font>

1725
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:36,010
individually line at 60 and at 62 and I

1726
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:36,010
NAT 01 @ 0 strangely enough is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ipv4</font>

1727
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:47,380
and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> junos summary commands</font>

1728
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:54,010
conclusion well I guess the conclusion

1729
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:56,520
is if you are turning on v6 in your

1730
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:58,450
network the configurations are actually

1731
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:00,700
frightening<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee similar to the v4</font>

1732
01:34:58,450 --> 01:35:07,269
configurations a little tweak here a

1733
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:10,030
little tweak their use these as use

1734
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:15,610
these as guidelines and maybe templates

1735
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:19,179
to do your configuration operators have

1736
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:23,650
gone through all the pain with IP with

1737
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:26,950
bgp with ipv4 in BGP so they know what

1738
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:28,480
kinds of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to to worry about and</font>

1739
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:32,380
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part they're the same in d6</font>

1740
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:33,730
so jumping have fun yeah and so the only

1741
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:37,030
comments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to make as a</font>

1742
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:39,759
conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that if you're using ospf</font>

1743
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:42,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sighs bgp i would strongly recommend</font>

1744
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:46,090
that you actually do use authentication

1745
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:50,639
of the peers for for either routing

1746
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:53,110
protocols and part mostly that is well I

1747
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:54,780
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you don't shoot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself in</font>

1748
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:58,960
the foot you know in case somebody makes

1749
01:35:54,780 --> 01:36:00,880
configuration errors for bgp it's more

1750
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,410
important because it runs over<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp you</font>

1751
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,950
don't want somebody spurious lee sending

01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:08,410
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp resets or anything like that</font>

1753
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:11,920
with is is remember that it's one

1754
01:36:08,410 --> 01:36:14,230
routing instance or before or v6 whereas

1755

<font color="#CCCCCC">with ospf you have to run you know one</font>

GP carry ipv4 routes and v6 I'm just

01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:43,210
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay two people typically</font>

1768
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:52,930
in my experience people have used bgp to

1769
01:36:50,110 --> 01:36:56,820
carry a single session to carry lots of

1772
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:06,250
of for wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run many instances is</font>

1773
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:08,620
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of one kind of route</font>

1774
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:11,230
and not a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other and you're</font>

1775
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:13,300
worried about what you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:39,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure to keep you saying that your v4</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some not splitted on</font>

01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:10,080
have concerns that want they have a lot

1792
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:11,219
of this kind of route in just a few of

that kind and they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

forget your name well Jake said you
