these three<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes pointed out here but</font>

89
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,539
then when there's a cable cut its

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,389
rerouted and there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called a</font>

00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,130
original path but with resolution it

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,919
protocol it adds a little bit more

101
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,800
intelligence that it knows to rira rear

102

104
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,690

105
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,610
subsea systems these these legs right

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,460

107
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">kilometers so this helps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to rear out</font>

108
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:03,650
things a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more efficiently on a</font>

109
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:07,280

00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:10,060
feeding of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable and under normal</font>

111
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,469
conditions so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need power on</font>

112
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,700
the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> going along the cable well we</font>

113
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,930

114
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,469
we

115
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,860
have repeaters on these subsea systems

116
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,330
and on one side there's a PF e feeding

117
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,070
Paul to the positive voltage on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

118
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,440

00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,780
negative voltage and it maintains a

120
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,719
constant current with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth on both</font>

121
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:38,250
sides and you can see in the middle

122
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,600
there's a there's a virtual earth so

123
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,490
there's an equal<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of positive and</font>

124
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,590
an equal amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative voltage</font>

125
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:48,190
coming on both sides so this is a normal

virtual earth now becomes a physical

132

you have on the same physical cable you

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,539
for the for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power and when there's a</font>

the shunt fault is if there's to shunt

157
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:24,060
faults in the middle then that basically

158
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,219
takes out the the surface

159
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,680
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's a there's an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

163

00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:41,010
of break well there's optical

165

measurements that can be taken to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

the through two repeaters and the

168
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,770
repeater amps will return to signal so

169
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,969
each repeater can can return the single

174
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,300

175
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:10,290
the light will actually bounced off the

176
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,020
actual part part of where the cut is and

177
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,939
then the repeater amp that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes back</font>

178
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,310
to realizes that it knows that it

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,460
shouldn't get a single back so when it

180

does it knows thats related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,730
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a cut and it will rewrite it back</font>

the the loss will go down but when it

191
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,370
hits a repeater will bounce back up so

192
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,850
you guys get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of formation it</font>

might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be always being an upwards</font>

198
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,180
pattern and it gets to the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

199
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,280
the actual cut is then you can see a you

200
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,370
know nonsense where the cut is and

201
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,650
that's where the estimate or the where

202
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,170
the cut actually is so they can take now

203
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:25,079
take a ship out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and well never fix it</font>

204
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got some nice drawings for</font>

you sorry i couldn't animate it these

206
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:33,240
are from our subsea guys okay with

207
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,400
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can locate the fault so</font>

208
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,500
what they do is they do a cutting drive

209
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,630
they have to cut the cable so they can I

210
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,440
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so they can pull it up and</font>

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:46,320
repair it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they'll hook the hook the</font>

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,250
don't see the dimension but this actual

220
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,630
10 kilometers or so where they grapple

it because they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some slack</font>

222
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,970
on it because when they pull it up they

223
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,800
don't want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off and they'll</font>

224
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,590
pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up not directly straight up</font>

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll they'll go along the cable path</font>

226
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,820
as they pull it gracefully and when they

227
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,830
get it up they cut the portion where

228
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,540
they grapple it and tie<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to a buoy and</font>

229
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,930
they go do the same thing on the other

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">side of the cable basically similarly</font>

231
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:34,199
leads leave some slack on it pull it up

232
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:37,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they put a tie box on it and they</font>

233
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,830
run new cable from that new splice all

234
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:43,050
the way up to where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Naboo he is and</font>

it down and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do it actually</font>

does<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like this when they do a</font>

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:52,290
repair it's a v-shaped where they were

239
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,450
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed really repair the cable so</font>

240
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:58,050
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a little bit of added</font>

241
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:00,720
distance but it's not significant out of

242
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,069
distance where it affects you know the

243
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,930
distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the repeaters the</font>

244
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,760
repeaters can compensate if there's a

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit at a distance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 kilometers</font>

246
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,600
or so and they have to drop it

247
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,340
perpendicular because if they just drop

248
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,700
it like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the cable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:16,020
tangle and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twist and and break again so</font>

250
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,080
they have to grace of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Li lei it</font>

251
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:22,530
perpendicular to to the actual original

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,570
cable path and these each one of these

<font color="#E5E5E5">slides that you can estimate about a</font>

254
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:30,930
day's worth of work so if there is a

255
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:33,510
cable cut affecting service you know

256
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,270
depending on weather conditions where

257
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:38,370
the cable ship is as related to where

258
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,020
the cut is it might take a week or so

259

just to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the site and then and</font>

260
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,650
then all these slides are about a day

get the same amount of gravity<font color="#E5E5E5"> a same</font>

284
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,860
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of transit through those</font>

285
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:53,130
locations but in Japan it's basically

286
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,950
Japan is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your main is your main</font>

287
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:59,529
aggregation point low statistical

288
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:01,060
multiplexing basically just the fact

289
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:05,050
that you know customers are reaching the

290
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:08,589
speeds of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the max bandwidth that we</font>

291
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:11,560
can have on the cable systems now this

292
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:13,510
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the just the illustration what I</font>

293
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,699
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a korea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

294
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,860
there's more outbound than there is

295
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:22,149
inbound from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> koreas perspective and</font>

296
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:26,770
other countries in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Asia opposite pretty</font>

297
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:29,020
pretty opposite ok this is the

298
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:32,350
traditional Asia us backbone

299
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:35,949
architecture now basically on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font>

300
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is your subsea cable system going along</font>

301
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:40,479
different cable landing stations it's

302
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of a fishbone type of architecture</font>

303
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,070
because each country has to have

304
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:49,959
backhaul to the pop so you have from the

305
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have your back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hall to the cable</font>

307
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,050
have your trans-pacific link and in

308
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,130
Japan<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have your back hole to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">tokyopop</font>

310
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,200
and excuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> me basically if you look at</font>

311
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,610
maybe it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hard to see on the</font>

312
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,930
diagram but if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red line</font>

313
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:11,630
here that illustrates the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the design</font>

314
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:14,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">wise were Tokyo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the aggregation point</font>

315
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:16,640
so traffic transit traffic to Hong Kong

316
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,070
for example if Japan is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main layer 3</font>

317
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,189
aggregation point it would come into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

318
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:25,270
cable stations in Japan ping pong to the

319
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:28,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Japan pop and a ping pong back at the</font>

320
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:31,250
back to the cable station and then on to

321
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,160
its destination so you can see one of

322
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,930
the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that are that's not</font>

323
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,839
efficient right now is this ping ponging

324
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,479
on the back hall especially in Tokyo so

325
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,860
you actually if a lot of the traffic for

326
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,140
other countries is is us transit you

327
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically have to care for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on this</font>

328
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,330
on this backhaul path and and sometimes

329
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can have up to double of the</font>

330
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:58,670
capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you really need on this</font>

331
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:01,970
this path<font color="#E5E5E5"> and another end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in one other</font>

332
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,589
example is if you had a circuit us all

333
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,930
the way to hong kong<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path it would</font>

334
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:08,510
take is like this it'll go through the

335
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:11,329
cable station hit-the hit-the sdh

336
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:13,490
equipment the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDH equipment</font>

337
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,980
protection ring go all the way to hong

338
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,770
kong this isn't efficient as well

339
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,050
because that that particular path that

340
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,150
particular circuit that traffic is

341
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:26,770
running on is only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used for</font>

342
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:29,150
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> hong kong so you want to look at</font>

343
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:32,360
what are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that we can</font>

344
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:37,100
do a little bit better one of the ideas

345
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,990
is putting a router at the cable station

346
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,250
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your IP routing and you're</font>

347
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,260
switching adding intelligence a new

348
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,990
layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intelligence closer to the</font>

349
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:51,130
actual you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know kia subsea cable system</font>

350
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:54,350
itself so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had if you had assets</font>

351
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:57,350
cable whining cable station assets if

352
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,650
you had the subsea cable system itself

353
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:04,000
you and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have an opportunity to</font>

354
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:07,389
to build out something like this so now

355
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,099
us turns at traffic bound for four

356
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:13,240
they're kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of asian bound countries</font>

357
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:15,369
it'll come into that to the subsea

358
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,930
article stations and instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

359
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:19,208
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SDH equipment now the router</font>

360
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,670
replaces the SDH function so it goes the

361
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,170
router and then if it's bound for Tokyo

362
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,200
it'll go over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back hall if it's</font>

363
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,940
bound for other countries it will go on

364
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next cable station to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

365
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:35,860
router etc so this will allow for a

366
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:38,320
better utilization and better management

367
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,360
of the capacity now it's not just Japan

368
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">as this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ping pong mean there's other</font>

369
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,850
countries that may transit other Asian

370
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,960
countries as well Singapore my transit

371
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:52,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kong etc so there's some efficiency</font>

372
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:58,960
we can gain by putting a router at the

373
00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:01,090
cable station<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok um basically this is</font>

374
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a simple diagram showing here's the</font>

375
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic pattern and then now we have</font>

376
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,330
since we're taking out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SDH layer we</font>

377
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:10,170
have to have some mechanism to maintain

378
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,970
the the fast switching that SDH gives us

379
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:16,990
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the 50 millisecond ranges so</font>

380
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:20,890
we want we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take advantage of all</font>

381
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,810
the cables are all the subsea segments

382
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,390
that we have connected and and create

383
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:29,260
protection protection paths may be using

384
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">fast rear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so we can create</font>

385
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:36,600
protection paths using different

386
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,600
different cable systems da c or c<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> c</font>

387
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,710
and what's the design concept there's no

388
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,020
longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> a traditional ring protection</font>

389
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:49,910
making a mechanism on top of the sub

390
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:51,950
seat and then layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 on top of that we</font>

391
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:54,830
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use Tangier and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fly because when</font>

392
00:18:51,950 --> 00:19:00,500
if I can detect similar alarms and

393
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:03,800
errors that sdh interfaces can the mpls

protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SDH gave us so the</font>

399
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:20,030
subsidy is basically one plus one you

400
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:22,730
have reserved<font color="#E5E5E5"> standby unusable capacity</font>

00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:26,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">whereas this you would have active in</font>

402
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,640
standby LSPs so it's a it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rip it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

404
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,550
and depending on what kind of mesh that

405
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:40,370
we want to make this new network as far

406
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:42,139
as MPLS we can we can use the M do

407
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,580
traffic monitoring and capacity

408
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:50,350
management using the LSP traffic data

409
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:53,179
add additional route reflector hierarchy

410
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:56,449
basically a lot of networks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asia</font>

411
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:59,780
they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> country route reflectors</font>

412
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:02,900
so some cable stations might serve more

413
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:05,360
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> one country so we might be able to</font>

414
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">make the cable stations if we want to</font>

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,219
participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP make them route</font>

416
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,690
reflectors of route reflectors or

417
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,610
something something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else it's just 11</font>

418
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,250
another thing we can consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as</font>

419
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:23,810
how we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do bgp with these new</font>

420
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:28,330
routers the cable station last point

421
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:30,520
there there's no GM pls a some type of

422
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,870
design there's no sea plane de plane

423
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,800
separation in this in this network it's

424
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,800

<font color="#CCCCCC">a very high level diagram showing the IX</font>

when I peer over are here to each other

00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:40,168
that way or the ethernet exchange a

method that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned an ISP once</font>
