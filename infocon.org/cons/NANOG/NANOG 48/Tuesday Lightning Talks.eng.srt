00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,500
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:12,150
lightning talks here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe the</font>

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,809
first one should be Marty Hanigan with

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,809
akamai

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,120
give me the spreadsheet do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool</font>

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,120
yeah

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,740
I focus on Martin Hanigan with akamai

8
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:09,010
and I'm presenting a lightning talk on a

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult talk even though it was</font>

11
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,910

15
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:26,259
fictitious no NDA's were harmed in the

00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,490
creation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation what I'm</font>

17
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is provide you with a</font>

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,149
framework to do your own analysis I

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,670
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this mostly applies to</font>

20
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,440
smaller home networks guys with maybe

21
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,880
one gig or less ports but I think you'll

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,210
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decide that for yourself so</font>

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,270
let's get to it so assumptions you're

24
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:46,570

31
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:03,880
transit through the exchange you want to

32
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,169
have decision criteria that is not just

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,000
performance-based you want to have some

34
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,250
facts to kind of back up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the decisions</font>

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,410
you make and most importantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all</font>

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,580
performance is not everything numbers

37
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,720
should help you make the decision as

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:20,170
well why bother well combined IX and

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,180
colo colo costs are rising now IX cost

40

themselves are kind of coming down<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,260
they're being forced down by the rising

of colo costs what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> killing</font>

43
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,540

I see so obviously in<font color="#CCCCCC"> those sections we</font>

74
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,330
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a relative demonstration</font>

75
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,360
of some of those intersections and as

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,790
you can see over time I<font color="#CCCCCC"> X plus Cola plus</font>

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,390
power costs are absolutely the most

78
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,489
expensive currently I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that you're</font>

obviously cost is one of them so let's

you assume that transit is ten dollars a

leaving it all to the bean counters

146
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,389
upstairs to tell you what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need so</font>

150
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:55,179
so so again these may not be your actual

<font color="#CCCCCC">costs it's just a framework to try and</font>

152
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,710
kind of get yourself to some

153
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:07,139
approximation of what your<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

154
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:09,820
but generally what we have here is so

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">the term pit cost is really negative it</font>

think you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep them in the</font>

principle you can fight all you want

165
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,150
with the accountants they're not going

<font color="#E5E5E5">to agree with you I do a little bit of</font>

168
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:39,099
because racks are a cost local currency

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:41,139
you may have racks in Europe you may

170

have racks in the United States the

171
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,070
costs in Europe are much different based

172
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,740
on the cost of a dollar than they are

173
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,940
here you across the capital again if

174
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,979
you're financing your equipment you've

175
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,330
got some costs related to that and I

176
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:55,270
like to estimate year-over-year growth

177
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,030
so I know my cost trends baby and also

178
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,039
what my footprint may end up growing at

179
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,799
on the right side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this sheet I</font>

180
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,990
identify a transit<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost on the left side</font>

181
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,470
I try to keep all my capital

expenditures rolled up totaled I

183
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,729
calculate all of my mrcs I bring over

<font color="#CCCCCC">some straight line depreciation from the</font>

187
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:23,349
example only forty four hundred bucks

188
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,510
down here at the bottom I actually have

189
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:27,610
a field where I can model<font color="#E5E5E5"> the usage so</font>

190

if I think that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I'm going</font>

exchange so generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it looks like</font>

193
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:38,440
decision wise so if all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font>

194
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:40,059
were actually true reflective numbers in

195
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,849
this case the i-x would be far more

196
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:45,400
expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> then rented but in the other</font>

201
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,660
much more expensive you still may have

202
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,610
reasons that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and</font>

203
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,420
pay those fees you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may actually care</font>

204
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,500
about performing

205
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,569
and be willing to pay that amount of

206
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:15,360
money to get it that's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you to</font>

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide well I'm dismayed you all right</font>

208
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,930
that's not the room

209
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,120
sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

210
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,980
so the summary is analyzed your<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost is</font>

211
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,060
really worthwhile and you sound much

212
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,070
more intelligent when you're debating

213
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,239
what you need in your network and how

214
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,280
you're going to architect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you</font>

certainly do matter and they frequently

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:23,500
do make the difference questions I think

234
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:26,110
I have time how do you take into

235
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,500
consideration static costs or committed

236
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:32,830
costs even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though peering or transit may</font>

237
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,870
be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost-effective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a per megabyte</font>

238
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:40,480
basis there's also some formulation for

239
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:44,200
committed costs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve</font>

240
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,940
certain cost price savings and cost

241
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,290
points does that make sense does the

242
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,480
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> exam yeah I think you're</font>

243
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,640
talking about some costs basically like

244
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,500
the partial Effie's and you know

245
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,060
full-time equivalents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whatnot needed</font>

246
00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:00,430
to actually be the peering coordinator I

247
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,319
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a framework</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

248
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,579
you can utilize and you can factor those

249
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,690
in if you have to so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you had a</font>

250
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,180
transit cost of nine dollars and

251
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,700
appearing cost of eight dollars you

252
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,900
could probably feel that one out if you

253
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">really wanted to make it strictly a</font>

254
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,530
financial decision you could start to

255
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,060
factor in an FTE I think what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

256
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,130
do there is you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take your FTE</font>

257
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,989
and put it in the MRC column and

258
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,910
guesstimate how many hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> per month you</font>

259
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,460

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">people have their own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bed photos we</font>

288
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,880
wrote our own also but in research

289
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,709
context and it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> nifty at a</font>

290
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point then also tively actually</font>

291
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:04,100
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell it commercially but</font>

292
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:06,140
that's I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a salesperson so why this</font>

293
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,810
lightning talk to get a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font>

294
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,840
operator input about what people would

295
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,810
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see in a network monitoring</font>

296
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,320
solution like stuff which takes it as

297
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:20,420
well for instance because well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

298
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,130
huge sites but we cannot always get up

299
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:27,439
earlier input because of legal issues

300
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:30,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so on so well the obvious screenshot</font>

301
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,600
of course you have nice little graph you

302
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,480
can define those aspects return the left

303
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,970
if you zoom in in the PDF for I don't

304
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if it's readable from the back on</font>

305
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,770
the left what you have then is aspects

306
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,170
you can configure these everything what

307
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,300
you want and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> clickety click and</font>

308
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:51,979
you get your data as long as sender flow

309
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,569
to it it's the whole point of the

310
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,420
research project is more like that we

311
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:59,480
can take a small box and st. large month

312
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,250
of net flow to it generally we will look

313
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,320
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks with at least 10 gigs</font>

314
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,630
because otherwise it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very</font>

315
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,690
challenging to program for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to</font>

316
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,760
optimize it to the extreme and as it

317
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,040
states also if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really want to have</font>

318
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,930
insanely largest network will take

319
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,510
bigger iron for it at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

320
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:20,839
another the cool thing is that we're

321
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:23,330
also doing research on network anomaly

322
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,850
behavior modeling so the tool

323
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,070
automatically even more or less<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

324
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:32,270
these speeds can provide these results

325
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:34,070
to the people also another cool thing is

326
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,810
that we have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of different</font>

327
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">visualizations of course this is an</font>

328
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,910
example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this c'mere 3d tool that a</font>

329
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:43,779
real copy years ago it takes live feed

330
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:46,629
this was done on a one gig link

331
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:49,120
so about<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think what 710 bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fool or</font>

332
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:51,100
something and then every line in the

333
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,160
bottom graph or in the bottom picture

334
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,749
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a single flow coming from one</font>

335
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,879
point to another of course flows are

336
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:59,230
generally sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one second so</font>

337
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,029
we delay them a little bit so that they

338
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,699
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay for the whole 40 text or</font>

339
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:04,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">something otherwise you would get a huge</font>

340
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:07,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">stereoscope of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flashes oh you would not</font>

341
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> identify them really</font>

342
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:13,709
where they were going to as the network

343
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:13,709
point was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> zurich maybe</font>

344
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,590
so the left side is the US and the right

345
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,350
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> was zerkin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Switzerland see if you</font>

346
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:30,170
see a bit in form of each country as you

347
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,700
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see in the map above it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font>

348
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,650
the line so that's something that we try

349
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do also a lot of visualization</font>

350
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,930
modeling and so on we also of course

351
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,430
have a nice traffic map overlaid over a

352
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,109
world map so you can see where your

353
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,939
network links are going how fool they

354
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,760
are so that they will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font>

355
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,800
color and so on and another cool thing

356
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,900
what we also have now is a choke point

357
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,790
estimator which can sort of tell you

358
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,949
like well if your traffic keeps on

359
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,599
growing over<font color="#CCCCCC"> while the period that we've</font>

360
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,340
seen up to now you will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

361
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,950
into an issue at this in this location

362
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,740
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will probably want to start</font>

363
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,750
doing bigger links that you upgrade to a

364
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,210
10 gig link instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one gig that you</font>

365
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:12,560
have there or something and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

366
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:14,630
fed from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP IP bgp or icy isis ospf</font>

367
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,579
depending of course if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

368
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,800
nice p network or an interpersonal work

369
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:23,150
so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things that we are already</font>

370
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing so the question more is what is</font>

371
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:29,000
interesting what are problems in in

372
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:31,430
operating networks that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

373
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,290
running into where you are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

374
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:37,939
tools which well don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist or what you</font>

375
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,079
have generally the problem because

376
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,660
that's of course from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a research</font>

377
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,840
perspective the interesting thing there

378
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,600
are problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there if you have well</font>

379
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">jerk research lab is only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 people so</font>

380
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,560
we have locally still control over the

381
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,590
network but it does of course very large

382
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,349
and the size of problems is of course

383
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:59,090
larger and people here tend to run very

384
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,920
large networks you have maybe sometimes

385
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:04,010
a million subscribers sometimes 10

386
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,859
million probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> some even 50 maybe so</font>

387
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">you run into different issues that in a</font>

388
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,689
small that<font color="#E5E5E5"> turkey will never find so if</font>

389
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:15,889
anybody has something like really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

390
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:17,839
that they would or well a problem that

391
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:22,420
would be cool if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you couldn't run up the</font>

speaker or mail us or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

393
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:28,850
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always give anything else my email</font>

394
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:33,678
address is there the Aurora website

395
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:35,119
ivonnealexander.com can just Google IBM

396

<font color="#E5E5E5">a Reuters quicker that you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

397
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:41,720
type to you full URL and get it

398
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,610
questions my name is Joanne from slide I

399
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,879
really I'm sorry I came in a little bit

400
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:50,119
late<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the way but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um I really need to</font>

401
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:52,309
event correlation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sort of DVR of my</font>

402
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,110
network map I need to be able to zoom

403
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:55,869
back to any time point say oh yeah link

404
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,549
was down and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what happened</font>

405
00:17:55,869 --> 00:18:00,439
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great to have a status map for a</font>

406
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:03,830
knock but it's also really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for me</font>

407
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,379
to go back it does indeed something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

408
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,600
guys probably know shoot ash that's my

409
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:09,949
burden I always and very bad in a

410
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,889
pronounced his name that the guy who

411

does<font color="#E5E5E5"> out blaze I'll blaze was bought by</font>

412
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:17,658
IBM at one point said there are now

413
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,999
loads of<font color="#CCCCCC"> slows its life and he also came</font>

414
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:23,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">in these with that question like well</font>

415
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:25,460
they get spam lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and spams our</font>

416
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,928
event or well technically anything that

417
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,109
you have in your system<font color="#CCCCCC"> cislo has an</font>

418
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:32,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">event and so on and we have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> busy</font>

419
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,489
building a system which indeed Darth

420
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,049
correlation because we have the network

421
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:39,379
behavior or normally detection already

422
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:41,899
and then correlating events like people

423
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:43,850
spamming if you have detected this in

424
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:45,949
one way or another or other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

425
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,678
events like well my firewall hits

426
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,470
somewhere or my snort long did something

427
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,299
and then indeed correlates directly to

428
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're huge data mine that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

429
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,499
already have from net flow as flow and
