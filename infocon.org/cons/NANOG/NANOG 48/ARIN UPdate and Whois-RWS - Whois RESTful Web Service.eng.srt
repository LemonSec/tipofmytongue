it and it actually looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,890
contrast makes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys look like a</font>

floating heads on the video feed what I

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that within our community I</font>

68
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,280
people are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to various other</font>

69
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,050
communities and telling them about this

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,880
and saying hey look you guys need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

71
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,940

72
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,700
you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be caught flat-footed</font>

so along with that goes on give me sort

74
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,250
of ever sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> education on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the RIR</font>

75
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,590
system and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as well as a</font>

76
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,090
policy development process that all you

77
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,530
all can be a part of if there's

78
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,230
something that you think that really

79
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,100
sucks at Aaron you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity</font>

80
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,530
to fix it with in the process here are

81
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,299
the current policy proposal discussions

82
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,580
and they go from directory service

83
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,740
changes in terms of privacy dealing with

84
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,140
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> standardization of</font>

85
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,570
registration requirements moving the

86
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,119
minimum assignment unit down to a / 24

87
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:58,079
at one point is the / 19 has gone down

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,830
and down and down now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplifying</font>

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,630
the actual sort of policies as they

90
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,120
exist today because there they have

91
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,950
evolved over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is really a</font>

92
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,530
testament to you guys in terms of

93
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,480
actually saying these policies up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

94
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,130
know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you policies are kind</font>

95
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,289
of like really boring blah blah blah

96
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,570
blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these things are really</font>

97
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,729
the engine the engine it helps drive

98
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,550
your business and are important for you

99
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:25,710
to actually understand if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

100
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,460
told at after the last meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

101
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:32,280
there's a pretty heavy dosage of of

102
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,260
Aaron presentations going on that we

103
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,409
shouldn't have used the word policy may

104
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,620
be used the word candy instead I'm not

105
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">really sure if that works it works with</font>

106
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,510
little kids you know when you want to

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">meet like they're real food you say like</font>

108
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,260
meat<font color="#CCCCCC"> and potatoes or whatever you say</font>

109
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,820
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> is candy just go ahead and eat it</font>

110
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,560
and they do and everything is<font color="#CCCCCC"> good I</font>

111
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,940
know you guys are way too smart for that

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,350
so I'll just keep on using the word

113
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,390
policy for now for<font color="#E5E5E5"> right ask numbers</font>

114
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:05,730
have we have a one-year deferment on

115
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:08,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">4-byte aaass you may recall there was</font>

116
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,700
this policy that was put forth that in

117
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:15,770
2010 the default was to give out for by

118
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:19,560
a asses that is not we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that</font>

119
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,539
we're actually giving out to bite upon

120
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,120
request so if you come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ask for a</font>

121
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,300
s number you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a to bite</font>

122
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,950
and that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a result of multiple</font>

123
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,500
things one is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,910
care of so the number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> for body asses</font>

145
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,490
were on that were issued<font color="#CCCCCC"> in two thousand</font>

146
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,920
nine or twelve Aaron had two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and</font>

147
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,450
we actually appeared with people on the

148
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,640
East Coast and the west coast with four

149
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,349
buddy asses encourage any of you who

150
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,150
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to appear with us to go ahead and</font>

151
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,400
do so and we could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

152
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">afterwards you be like the typical</font>

153
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,539
reason for exchange as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

154
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:53,100
before is the upstream doesn't support

155
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:56,870
it for by<font color="#CCCCCC"> D asses now for the other part</font>

156
00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:00,810
of the perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> storm for v4 run out and</font>

157
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:03,510
or depletion you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you</font>

158
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,240
have these these slides in terms of the

159
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,969
central registry which is a pre space

160
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,580
that was given out before the IR IR

161
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:17,220
system was actually put in place

162
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:22,680
that we currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 22 / eights left</font>

163
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:27,060
to give out that's going to happen

164
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,969
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the end of next year where</font>

165
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is going to be totally depleted and</font>

166
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:36,449
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens there's going to be</font>

167
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:38,068
some time where<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron in other regional</font>

168
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,719
registries will have space to give out

169
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,310
but there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a whole sea</font>

170
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:47,159
change that's going to happen after that

171
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:48,840
that that event so kind of ponder that

172
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:51,900
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> while and I know there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

173
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">good things going on v6 but the amount</font>

174
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,429
of deployment that's going on I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

175
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,039
give you example we see a fraction of

176
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:05,690
one percent of our actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic being</font>

177
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,690
over v6 yep

178
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:25,869
Mike my sound guy wake up please<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know given what you just said are</font>

181
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:35,300
you is anybody doing anything from the

182
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,460
registry side other than kind of like

183
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:44,290
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jeff and those guys</font>

184
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:46,700
regarding how he'll post run out

185
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:51,170
allocation of ipv4 space is going to

186
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,400
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that a framed up enough to let</font>

187
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,979
you answer there you want me to go

188
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,689
further hmm that's kind of interesting

189
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,940
how the frameworks going to happen well

190
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,100
well there's there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean what do the</font>

191
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,890
rirs think is going to happen and what

192
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,900
have they done you know I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what Jeff</font>

193
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,819
and Georgia doing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that kind of</font>

194
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,829
stuff but what do you know what are you

195
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,650
guys doing so one of the things that's

196
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:16,040
been put in place is a relaxed transfer

197
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:20,120
policy and there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

198
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,730
opportunity for people to list network

199
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:28,190
resources that they maybe have made

200
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:30,230
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to others and a list of people</font>

201
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been properly vetted they have</font>

202
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,490
a need for that as address space and

203
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,290
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to happen</font>

204
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,180
over the next year so there there's

205
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:42,069
going to be an<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity for people to</font>

206
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:46,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">get address space but it won't be</font>

207
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:48,410
basically space that's been previously

208
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,230
unallocated button from other it's going

209
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have some history associated with it</font>

210
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,790
so that that's one particular venue

211
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,780
another is that v6 is going to actually

212
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:02,360
take off and everybody will have their

213
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,670
very sort coexistence strategies put in

214
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,520
place so that if from end users

215
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:10,550
perspective is totally transparent in

216
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,520
terms of their connecting to a v6 aware

217
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,740
server or v4 aware server and they are

218
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,130
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make things work in some other</font>

219
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,470
fashion so now I know there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

220
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,750
work that's finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> awakened that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

221
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">way over the last two years but it's</font>

222
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,540
been it is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

223
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,970
it's quite scary how little sort of

224
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,829
transition has actually occurred to this

225
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,560
point in time given that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

226
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:45,140
just really<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the subject upcoming</font>

227
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:46,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">deadlines Mike right I'm right um so I</font>

228
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,120
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my question was i want i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to i</font>

229
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,370
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it more pointed um all of</font>

230
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff yeah yeah you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

231
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:58,010
stuff yah yah more ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

232
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">yep but what's going to happen is and</font>

233
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,650
what is happening is there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

234
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,570
a market out there for this stuff right

235
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,069
it's a commodity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people are going</font>

236
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:08,360
to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trade and stuff like that and</font>

237
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:10,760
how from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RA our perspective is you</font>

238
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,610
know i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it's it's a new it's a new</font>

239
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,290
entity kind of thing right and you know

240
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,510
it has impact on the routing system has

241
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,390
impact on all of this stuff right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

242
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,990
kind of look at this and I go well

243
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,670
people are doing different things

244
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,500
there's neapolitan like you said like

245
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,020
the transfer policy in it and what you

246
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,550
know you know all the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going</font>

247
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,530
on at<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap Nick and all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

248
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,050
stuff right yeah but none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

249
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,670
contemplates the real world in some way

250
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,500
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world is you know you</font>

251
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,140
were saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think your</font>

252
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,360
terminology is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like verified</font>

253
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,510
need right yeah verified need is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

254
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,130
to be checkbook right correct and that's

255
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the different kind of verified need than</font>

256
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,939
what we've been talking about the cops

257
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,730
yep that's true gothic jaws go out and

258
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:56,900
how to say something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this as well</font>

259
00:11:51,730 --> 00:12:00,920
like some good questions john curran CEO

260
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:02,420
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron them okay if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

261
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">what happens when we get to the free</font>

262
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,310
pool depletion it's a changed world

263
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,730
you're right there's two things that

264
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:13,189
registries do right now we keep track<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

265
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,560
who has what block that's a registry

266
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,960
function and it's an allocation function

267
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,209
where we take a free pool and we

268
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,220
allocate it well there's no free pool

269
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,160
there's no allocation but there's still

270
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,620
the registry function going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so all</font>

271
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,240
the rirs are planning to continue to be

272
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,710
registries and continue to handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

273
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:36,410
the real question comes up of how does

274
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,460
how do people find address space if

275
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,680
there's no free pool

276
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,340
so that's our transfer listing service I

277
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">know other rirs are working on things</font>

278
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,030
but at the end of the day there's only

279
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,140
so much blood you're going to get from

280
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:56,699
the stone because we're allocating 10 to

281
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,620
12 / 8 per year even if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

282
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,740
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those are unused and his legacy</font>

283
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,710
addresses that can be reclaimed what are

284

286
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:14,700
end of the day while we can do things to

287
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:17,670
help get the v4 address space to where

288
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,740
it's needed that's only going to give us

289
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,560
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few more years at some point it's</font>

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:26,400
simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> four billion addresses gets too</font>

291
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,469
tight to get the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> done so the IRS are</font>

292
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,209
all working to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that someone</font>

293
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,850
who has address space<font color="#E5E5E5"> need can get it</font>

294
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,810
once we get to an allocation pool that

295
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:39,000
doesn't exist need will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be yep you say</font>

296
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,859
you need it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to get the</font>

297
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,470
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space but you're going to have</font>

298
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,820
to find someone who has it and motivate

299
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:50,250
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer it so that can't last</font>

300
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:54,320
forever it can only give us a few more

301
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:58,200
years unless the whole world goes to

302
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">dynamic assignment for edges and I at</font>

303
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,930
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day all the IRS can do is</font>

304
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:07,079
prepare to be better I ours better

305
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,579
registries that don't have an allocation

306
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:14,550
function since it won't be a free people

307
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:17,970
to allocate hey guys so can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we let mark</font>

308
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,920
finish his presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we'll</font>

309
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,770
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all this right at the end I know</font>

310
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,750
we're at a perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> point but let's let</font>

311
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,460
him finish his presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we</font>

312
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">could take all the questions actually I</font>

313
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:32,520
thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

314
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">upstairs and change my shirt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so had</font>

315
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,680
one of the things I like to do is if you

316
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,870
guys are intrigued by this please come

317
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to our meeting so we have a meeting us</font>

318
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:46,020
in Toronto in mid-april and registration

319
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,790
is open for that and for you who don't

320
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,439
have the funds to do that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

321
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,270
fellowship program that is

322
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,380
made available and a deadline for that

323
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:57,360
is februari 26 so what I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

324
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,950
now about engineering activities and so

325
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the stuff is stuff that you</font>

326
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:06,900
should least<font color="#CCCCCC"> Im</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really excited about</font>

327
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:08,670
so we've done on we've gone to a agile

328
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,730
development process and we're doing

329
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">monthly updates to the Aaron website</font>

330
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:19,580
Aaron online and you will see

331
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:21,960
incremental increases in the amount of

332
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,550
new features that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are made available in</font>

333
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,740
fact I one person<font color="#CCCCCC"> came up to me and said</font>

334
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,620
this is great I finally can now know

335
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,290
what resources i have but then from

336
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful now we have a</font>

337
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple other things that are going on</font>

338
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,930
there big as well one is DNS SEC we hope

339
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,170
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're going</font>

340
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have three big initiatives coming out</font>

341
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:45,329
one is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to include</font>

342
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,370
your GS records for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse entries</font>

343
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,670
within our system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will allow that</font>

344
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:55,650
will have that finished by in 2010 we're

345
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:58,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have a certificate based system</font>

346
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:02,370
for you to actually link your autonomous

347
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:05,460
system origin your origin ESS with your

348
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:07,860
network allocations that's called rpki

349
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,600
it's a pilot right now I encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

350
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,670
if you have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go ahead and play</font>

351
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,260
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> love to have</font>

352
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,900
feedback from you guys on this is

353
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,110
because this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important</font>

354
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,670
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us as we go ahead and</font>

355
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">finally who is our WS with dandy is</font>

356
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,620
going to talk about here shortly again I

357
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,390
pilots now available for you to go ahead

358
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:32,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and play with and we encourage you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

359
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:36,120
so when it thinks that we've seen is<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

360
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:39,270
who is traffic increase its like

361
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,430
exponential right now and this is this

362
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,339
typically is a wonderful thing to have

363
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,719
and we're able to keep up the load but

364
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,089
we're starting to get worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

365
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,010
because we're saying why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we seeing</font>

366
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:54,690
all this all this traffic all of a

367
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:56,130
sudden and what's causing this and one

368
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've done is looking</font>

369
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,970
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic we found that at fifty</font>

370
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:03,239
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it self referential it's</font>

371
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,490
basically a guy coming in for a person

372
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,920
coming from a particular IP address

373
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking for that particular IP address</font>

374
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,540
and their signal to inquiries so they

375
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">just come in once and they leave so</font>

376
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,959
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't like someone that's</font>

377
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,659
trying to serve some sort of geolocation

378
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,730
services and you know trying to download

379
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,740
or database over who is these are

380
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,050
singleton queries for the most part and

381
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">its most interesting it doesn't appear</font>

382
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be a botnet we've talked to various</font>

383
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,080
researchers out there and giving them

384
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,950
some I it's some traffic to look at and

385
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,889
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not seeing any sort of</font>

386
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,570
correlation so if any of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen</font>

387
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,520
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this as in terms of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

388
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">application that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are downloading</font>

389
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,750
it most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems to be windows-based</font>

390
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,730
boxes please let us know because we're

391
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,760
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing what's going on see</font>

392
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,929
if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually stop this or at least</font>

393
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,070
minimize it and try to figure out

394
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:56,730
there's a better way of doing these

395
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:58,200
things so this actually led us to say

396
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,210
okay what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we going to do with who is</font>

397
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,420
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whois protocol is dipped in</font>

398
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:07,470
deprecated<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the ITF this is a really</font>

399
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,880
pretty stupid protocol it's theirs it's

400
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of like sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a query you get</font>

401
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,250
back a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what does this</font>

402
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean well I want to sit in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

403
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,780
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm is that really what you mean</font>

404
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,820
let me just see if that actually matches

405
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,250
the autonomous system number and I'll

406
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,290
see if that matches or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that IP</font>

407
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,290
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually matches a company name</font>

408
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,149
which may or may not happen so there's

409
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,760
all sorts of weird quirky behaviors that

410
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,550
are in legacy who has servers they give

411
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,290
you back sort of unexpected results and

412
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,940
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

413
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a new look at this we have been</font>

414
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,990
taken a new look at this and so what

415
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,719
Andy's going to talk about now is who is

416
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,550
RWS restful web service and hopefully

417
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of these things will become a</font>

418
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,270
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more clear to you and you'll</font>

419
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:55,559
see this as a much better sort of

420
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:59,550
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> going forward so Andy all right</font>

421
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,928
thanks mark so one of the questions you

422
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,820
prominent<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we might want to ask is</font>

423
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:04,830
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly is rest it stands for</font>

424
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,490
represent representational state

425
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:10,500
transfer it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually part of I think</font>

426
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,919
Roy Fielding's dissertation and he's one

427
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the guys who created HTTP it isn't</font>

428
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:20,259
specific to http however

429
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:21,580
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you apply it to http people</font>

430
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:24,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">tend to call these things restful web</font>

431
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,889
services the concept really isn't all

432
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,289
that hard essentially what it is is you

433
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:32,649
apply standard database style crud

434
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:35,320
operations to the different HTTP methods

435
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:37,029
available that's the first part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it in</font>

436
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,830
the second part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is you have think</font>

437
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:41,049
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs which address</font>

438
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:43,990
resources and it's pretty

439
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:46,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightforward that way this whole</font>

440
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,730
model of how you do programmatic

441
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,399
interactions over the internet with

442
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:54,309
restful web services is very popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

443
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,479
see with Amazon's s3 service and you see

444
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:58,299
it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the Yahoo and google</font>

445
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,059
services where they allow developers to

446
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:04,600
talk to their systems via<font color="#CCCCCC"> via a restful</font>

447
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:07,059
web service so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an industry buzz</font>

448
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,129
word and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions probably</font>

449
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:12,340
you might be asking is why on earth is

450
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:13,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron getting into this and it isn't</font>

451
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,459
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an industry buzz word that</font>

452
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:17,350
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we decided to go down this path</font>

453
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,679
actually what started us down this path

454
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:23,139
was we have a fairly big reengineering

455
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:26,500
effort going on in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accommodate</font>

456
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:27,699
our later phases of DNS SEC and some of

457
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,399
the lane checking that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

458
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,580
and in the process who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font>

459
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,320
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rewritten so we took we</font>

460
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,330
started to take a look at the components

461
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,629
we've already used for Aaron<font color="#CCCCCC"> online and</font>

462
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:42,279
we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy using</font>

463
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:44,019
that software stack to create a restful

464
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:47,470
web service and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

465
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:49,149
hook on other other things so that's the

466
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,129
that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how we started down</font>

467
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:54,489
this path and of course when you start

468
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:56,379
talking about redoing all this all these

469
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,879
hooks into our data you can actually

470
00:20:56,379 --> 00:21:02,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up with a system that's much more</font>

471
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:04,689
highly usable by end users so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

472
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,299
useful to who is well things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> POCs</font>

473
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:10,240
orgs<font color="#E5E5E5"> nets all those things will have</font>

474
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,950
URLs<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs you can cut you can cut and</font>

475
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,309
paste and send an email and all sorts of

476
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:20,070
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people can click on but we all</font>

477
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:22,870
click on email URLs an email right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

478
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,760
it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives a very simple programmatic</font>

479
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:28,179
in from interface into that who is

480
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:32,560
data compared to the nickname<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 43</font>

481
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:34,150
protocol you get a lot more discreet

482
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,980
types of inputs and outputs that you're

483
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at and of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to</font>

484
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:43,270
reuse all the HTTP infrastructure I

485
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,580
don't want to actually do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> job of</font>

486
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,020
selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest to you because there's a</font>

487
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,909
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good book out there from O'Reilly</font>

488
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,220
on restful web services it's a very

489
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,470
quick read you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and it</font>

490
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,910
actually describes how a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

491
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,940
services that it will walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> you through</font>

492
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Amazon s3 interface and so forth but</font>

493
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,660
it described it does a very good job of

494
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:05,950
describing the rest and just how simple

495
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:08,260
it is are as Mark said we do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a demo</font>

496
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:11,590
up I think it's been up since October

497
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:14,800
and it's actually available natively

498
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:19,169
over v6 so if you have v6 you can go

499
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:23,290
there it's also available on before but

500
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:25,030
so here's what we have essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

501
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,180
have the restful web service which talks

502
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:30,810
to a database on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> via who is our DBS</font>

503
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,890
nodes and that thing is synced with our

504
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:36,909
registration database back at our

505
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:39,760
offices we're not getting rid of port 43

506
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,770
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point here but what our</font>

507
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,210
port 40 we have a port 43 proxy which

508
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,730
essentially just translates all those

509
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,350
port 43 queries into restful web

510
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,410
services and then talks to our our our

511
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:54,879
service we<font color="#CCCCCC"> also have and we have had for</font>

512
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:57,700
a long time a regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> web browser web</font>

513
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,170
interface and<font color="#E5E5E5"> indoor who is data we're</font>

514
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to keep we're hearing that forward</font>

515
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,040
as well and that's doing the same trick

516
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,240
it's just going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn around take take</font>

517
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,710
what you've put in there and translate

518
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">it into something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually</font>

519
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,270
get a rest will talk to the restful web

520
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:15,310
service and the outputs you actually get

521
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:16,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">URLs that you can cut and paste note</font>

522
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">down at the bottom it says we haven't</font>

523
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,260
written any clients that's kind of one

524
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,110
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bonuses for restful web services</font>

525
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,760
and the reason we haven't written in

526
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,600
clients is because you already have them

527
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,100
a web browser is a restful client there

528
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,889
are a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> command-line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clients as</font>

529
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,480
well like<font color="#E5E5E5"> W get curl and when you're</font>

530
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,680
outputting XML there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

531
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">command-line clients for dealing with</font>

532
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,100
the XML and I'll run<font color="#E5E5E5"> through some of</font>

533
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:44,650
those again any modern web browser can

534
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,689
do this they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> also do we call SSL</font>

535
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:49,390
transforms so when we hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> you back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML</font>

536
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:52,210
they can transform it into HTML or text

537
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,100
or well what anything you'd like if

538
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,660
you're using Firefox and you actually

539
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">just want to see xml data structures</font>

540
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">firefox actually does a pretty good job</font>

541
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,379
of showing formatted<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml and of course</font>

542
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:05,500
almost any browser can use the basic web

543
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,930
form that we have so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

544
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,340
command lines command line clients which

545
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think a lot of people here would be</font>

546
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,139
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in well basically if you and</font>

547
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are these are found on like unix</font>

548
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">and unix-like systems or if you have</font>

549
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,890
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> cygwin for windows curl</font>

550
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,970
and w get you can just put an HTTP URL

551
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,800
in there and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back the</font>

552
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,850
information you need if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

553
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,560
process it and do a little more

554
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a little more processing</font>

555
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,679
with the data you get back you can use

556
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:34,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">XML lint or xslt proc which can then XLT</font>

557
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,890
proc is a nice little utility it will

558
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,010
take an<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML document that we can send</font>

559
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:41,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">you over an HTTP URL and you can</font>

560
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,720
transform it into whatever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

561
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:46,180
we even<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide some SSL style sheets</font>

562
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,290
for that again we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are still going to</font>

563
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:54,850
offer the nickname who is port 43

564
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:56,920
interface you can use that with any who

your your who is client<font color="#E5E5E5"> works it's a to</font>

567
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:04,170
tell it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out a specific post but</font>

568
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,540
right now you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it out who is</font>

569
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:11,860
our DBS demo<font color="#CCCCCC"> data internet keep in mind</font>

570
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:14,830
that's not restful but the majority<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

571
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">people still use port 43 so here's an</font>

572
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,929
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the rest will call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into our</font>

573
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,960
system and what you see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

574
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:24,580
example of using XML lint and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

575
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,550
tell me X a moment to format the xml

576
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:30,250
output and all i said was<font color="#E5E5E5"> xml format</font>

577
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:33,190
this and here's the URL and basically

578
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:38,260
you know points at our system the demo

579
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:40,990
site / rest / park /<font color="#CCCCCC"> costard errand</font>

580
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:43,870
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark coster's POC handle and</font>

581
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,490
boom all sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have all his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his POC</font>

582
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:48,260
handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> xml format and the structured</font>

583
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,720
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can deal with</font>

584
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,160
so again that's that's one of the things

585
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,050
we're doing here we're providing all our

586
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:59,480
resources as<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs so you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> POCs that</font>

587
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,010
our URLs if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be organ and</font>

588
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,500
organization such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin you would say</font>

589
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:06,790
/ org slash Erin that's the URL for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

590
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,500
and so forth it also you can do relative

591
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,090
URLs you can say I want all the networks

592
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,810
assigned touring organizations so you'd

593
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:19,399
say / org slash or handle / nets and you

594
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:20,659
have their networks we support all the

595
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,230
same searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you would see under</font>

596
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,720
port 43 such as if you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

597
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the organs with a certain name you</font>

598
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,430
would say orgs semicolon name equals

599
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin and it'll do that'll support</font>

600
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:38,510
wildcards unlike port 43 you can

601
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:40,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually match terms mix and match terms</font>

602
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:43,310
so you see the last example down there

603
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,960
I'm looking for someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> pse whose first</font>

604
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,960
name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark and last name as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coster's</font>

605
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:55,280
IP addresses again as Mark said I a

606
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,920
ninety-one percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all our queries</font>

607
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,920
are for IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I believe it's</font>

608
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,650
actually above that now to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

609
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,660
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say / IP / IP address and</font>

610
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,160
boom you've got it we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

611
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">support we support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> site or queries over</font>

612
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,310
this interface and initially we weren't

613
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to support the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> queries</font>

614
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:15,980
over 43 but we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually decided that</font>

615
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:19,220
will and that code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually running</font>

616
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:22,280
so port 43 now supports<font color="#E5E5E5"> cider queries as</font>

617
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:24,560
well and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things again with IP</font>

618
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,860
addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> saito</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> queries such as</font>

619
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,560
relative<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs such as I want am network</font>

620
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:37,159
more specific for this cider query or

621
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:39,429
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this IP address we are primary focus</font>

622
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,660
and output is XML however we do have

623
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:45,710
Jason outputs if you're doing some sort

624
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:47,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of JavaScript or Ajax style application</font>

625
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,430
and we do know that people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

626
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,740
this because looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the logs you can</font>

627
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,940
tell there's at least one person who has

628
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,510
written an application against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

629
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,270
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> already we also put text in HTML</font>

630
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:01,500
out there and we provide style sheets so

631
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,720
you can run the XML through your own

632
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,160
through a style sheet and transform this

633
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,960
data into<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you need if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

634
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,880
it in comma separated values or tab

635
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,070
separated values you could use a style

636
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,880
sheet for that and again we provide some

637
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:17,730
as a starting place for everybody and so

638
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,620
here's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of doing that using</font>

639
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,180
xslt prodigious again another command

640
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,310
line tool probably have it on your

641
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,100
systems basically all I've done is I've

642
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:28,919
handed a template and I've handed it the

643
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:35,399
URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> for mark coster's PSC and it printed</font>

644
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:38,040
it out in text form this time the other

645
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,960
things we can do and we can because

646
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,700
we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the HTTP infrastructure is</font>

647
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,100
there are things we can't do with who is

648
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,740
such as take advantage of all those HTTP

649
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,810
caches that are out there say for

650
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,940
instance that you have you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

651
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,280
sort of analysis tool that's query our

652
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,890
whois servers for information are you

653
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,360
have multiple these things out there

654
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,010
there's no need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you to ask ask us</font>

655
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,469
the question multiple times if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

656
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,150
up your own local proxy local caching

657
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,670
proxy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have your your</font>

658
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:08,040
different analyzers ask the caching

659
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:12,420
proxy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll get it</font>

660
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:15,030
back much faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we we are using</font>

661
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,920
caching on our side<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help alleviate</font>

662
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,960
load as well and that's something that

663
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,170
you can you can do you don't have to do

664
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,460
it's up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but it's possible because</font>

665
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,460
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using all that web infrastructure</font>

666
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,760
we haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this today but it's</font>

667
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:33,500
possible we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> always put in</font>

668
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,430
referrals to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two individual</font>

669
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,630
organizations so when someone looks at

670
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,220
an organization they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know who</font>

671
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,110
they are they get our information on it

672
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,480
and if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization provided us our</font>

673
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,889
URL we could actually spit that out in

674
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the you in the output</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as well saying by</font>

675
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,710
the way for no more information about

676
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,170
this organization or this particular

677
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">network that they have here you can go</font>

678
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,620
chase down the URL and we know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

679
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:56,790
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do that for or should put</font>

680
00:29:52,620 --> 00:30:00,540
it on any<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of resource and another</font>

681
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:03,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can because HTTP has</font>

682
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">built-in authentication mechanisms we</font>

683
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,960
can start thinking about policies that

684
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:09,360
allow authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> and different types</font>

685
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,740
of authorization for information today

686
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,639
with who is you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really do that</font>

687
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:18,330
it's an all

688
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:19,920
and type protocol and when we also can

689
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,649
support versioning one of the problems

690
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">with who is is that when someone queries</font>

691
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,670
us if they're trying to make machine

692
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,520
parse that information if we change the

693
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:32,040
output which we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> from time to time</font>

694
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,360
sometimes it breaks their parsers that

695
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,879
can be kind of a headache for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

the PDF file you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go get that off of</font>

706
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,910
our web server here and then we have a

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,210
mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> list for people to ask questions</font>

708
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:10,020
on as well and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could subscribe to</font>

709
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,670
that it's open<font color="#E5E5E5"> to anybody and then one</font>

710
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,139
of the less things we're doing is in

711
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:18,390
addition to upgrading or enhancing the

712
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,160
actual interface we also took a look at

713
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,410
how often we can change the frequency

714
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,050
updates to the service itself today<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

715
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,740
everyday unit things don't have the

716
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:30,330
service is only updated every 24 hours

717
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,680
but what we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the</font>

718
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,470
infrastructure for<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually replicating</font>

719
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,870
data and because we're using a lot of

720
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">those air and online components we can</font>

721
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:41,879
now ship data out to the nodes much more

722
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,680
frequently at the moment we're looking

723
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,840
at every 10 minutes we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

724
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,720
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that down to even a smaller amount</font>

725
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,470
of time depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the load we</font>

726
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,020
anticipate so are there any questions

727
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:59,340
this is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can now ask mark all the</font>

728
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:00,600
ipv6 policy questions too I guess but if

729
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,310
you have any questions about the who is

730
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:08,429
restful service we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have the the</font>

731
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:11,370
website and the mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron their</font>

732
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:14,760
first a great job this looks nice this

733
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:17,340
is a good step I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if the</font>

734
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,310
XML schema that you've got as one

735
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,810
is the intended standard and shouldn't

736
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:25,649
change this point or at least supports

737
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:29,760
the versioning that you mentioned right

738
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:31,530
now we only<font color="#CCCCCC"> have I would not say the 10</font>

739
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,810
what we said what we're saying is 10 is

740
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,810
final though it won't change a whole lot

741
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:41,100
there is no I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font>

742
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:43,919
standard as far as like a standards body

743
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,540
would do sorry but we will lock it down

744
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,550
if that's what you're asking yeah so I'm

745
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,110
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we make code</font>

746
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,490
modifications to start playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with us</font>

747
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:53,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and expect that that version won't</font>

748
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">change as when we go into production is</font>

749
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,240
when we go into production when we plan

750
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,159
on locking it down and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for</font>

751
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're still tinkering with some</font>

752
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,930
of the some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend processes and</font>

753
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,090
we have to anticipate our upcoming

754
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,520
delegation model and we still have a

wednesday afternoon is half the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

764
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,670
that takes a program committee change

765
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,470
but if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get operator</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is their way wrong time for it we</font>

768
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,649
keep asking people to come to meetings

769
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,169
when there's less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a third of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

attendees in the room which doesn't

00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,560
probably get the point across and

looking around<font color="#E5E5E5"> at people I see if the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mics it's usually the people that are at</font>

air and meetings up here talking also on

775
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,260
the comments about getting people to

779
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,520
to extend the two days in october where

780
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,439
we have the joint meeting so perhaps we

781
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,030
should focus on getting people to add

782
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,050
two days to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their stay rather than go to</font>

787
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:26,540
said earlier I'm sure that every single

788
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">person in this room has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a party</font>

790
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:35,899
some sort of discussion where the

00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:38,690
depletion comes up and somebody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

we need to do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fix this problem is</font>

796
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:49,879
start reclaiming the space that isn't

being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and the problem just goes</font>

798
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:55,129
away and I think that all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us need to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that whenever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear</font>

00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,360
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that depends on your needs the we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't at present are not planning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

846
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,250
putting any cache control headers in the

847
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:21,580
in their responses so we would not be

848
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:26,590
playing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> caches however</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

849
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:28,900
doesn't stop you from doing stuff so if

850
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,340
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a five-minute timeout or</font>

851
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,870
something like five minute default that

852
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,400
spiration is good then that's that's

853
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:36,000
that's probably good it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really</font>

854
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,490
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wouldn't</font>

855
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,670
personally I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cases for</font>

856
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:46,419
going above maybe 10 minutes but it

857
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,470
really really depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you just</font>

858
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,630
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add to that a little bit the</font>

859
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:51,790
frequency updates isn't all that high as

860
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,170
well so it's it's not like you have to

861
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,980
worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something changing in the</font>

862
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:59,740
next five minutes on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it get on it</font>

863
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:03,100
on a frequent basis because it probably

864
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:06,870
won't change that much yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

865
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:10,330
it's really to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you not us thank you</font>

866
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,650
yes ed epaulettes new star<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

re ours through that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so first of</font>

871
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,100
all we haven't implemented that yet

872
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">because what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would require is for</font>

us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our provisioning systems</font>

874
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:30,940

database that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's wise this slide</font>

876
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:36,480
says the future isn't it the future

877
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:39,580
enabled it could be to anything really

878
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,220
we don't I don't I don't see why we

879
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,259
would

880
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,359
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL maybe we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a policy I</font>

881
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,619
don't know it so that depends on a

882
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,940
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that depends on us</font>

883
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:49,609
first implementing the feature and

884
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,560
second it depends on on an act someone

885
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:54,799
instituting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin are getting Erin to</font>

886
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,060
institute a policy on this what about

887
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the other re ours are they</font>

888
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,570
doing something similar to this would

889
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">you be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> land something there I've</font>

890
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:04,250
been told in private about things but I

891
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,930
don't want to speak for other rirs<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

892
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:08,060
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be very useful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

893
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,710
have that so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of add on to</font>

894
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,599
this they're there they're looking at us

895
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:14,060
right now and say oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks pretty</font>

896
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,310
intriguing this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we may</font>

897
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,130
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do as well let us know Erin how</font>

898
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:23,810
you proceed along this and how well it

899
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:29,000
doesn't work carbon will be 0 certify

900

and pakora before claiming this to be

901
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,109
production crate you need to standardize

902
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:42,379
it at I can metal to cover all the IRS

903
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:44,690
and all the TLD who is services this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

904
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:48,650
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very useful service this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

905
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:51,349
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed but they present their</font>

906
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:54,320
cows off of have everything better who

907
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:58,880
is space to have their own format on a

00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,700
bit over<font color="#E5E5E5"> on format on things is is</font>

909
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,830
terrible with regards to automation on

00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,899
security services this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very much</font>

911
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,869
needed but please coordinate this with

912
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:12,460
other rirs<font color="#CCCCCC"> at parks at the global level</font>

913
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:16,609
yeah but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer to that today</font>

914
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:19,730
we're also involved working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

915
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:21,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exposing this to them and there's a</font>

916
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,849
working group that's looking at this

917
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">within I can is going with the</font>

918
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:27,500
internationalized names but it serves

919
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:29,029
the same sort of purpose of which

920
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,250
they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at right now in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

921
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:34,660
what is minimal sore requirements for a

922
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:37,570
register register on for example and

923
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:41,089
mainly looking at the TLD sort of side

924
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:43,880
but this also goes to the stuff that

925
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:46,099
we're doing as well so these there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

926
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,990
exposure there that the good news is is

927
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:50,150
that there's backward compatibility so

928
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:53,439
that you still have who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as it</font>

929
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:55,089
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and we're working towards that</font>

930
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,140
that the framework that Andy's brought

931
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:58,599
up here which is actually quite

932
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,730
excellent on doing some more sore

933
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,069
regularize sort of ways of getting this

934
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,200
information because right now is wildly

935
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:07,839
inconsistent doing queries across the

936
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:13,149
board no<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter which registry you go to</font>

937
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:16,210
I'm getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> responses back um so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

938
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:19,690
question from David Conrad he asks why

00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:22,810
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin use crisp or iris and are</font>

you guys intending to take restful who

941
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:31,920
is into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ITF um and if there's one</font>

942
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:35,260
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that you know that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I</font>

943
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,720
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> very familiar with Chris pork and the</font>

944
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:41,619
Irish protocol my name is on most of

945
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:43,390
those RFC's actually and a couple of

946
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:45,010
think two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago or a year and a half</font>

947
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:48,879
ago or something like that internally we

948
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:50,890
were talking about crisp and iris if you

949
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,760
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how much deployment that has</font>

950
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:56,680
though it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not very wide in</font>

951
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,720
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the biggest the largest</font>

appointment is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Enoch and that's</font>

953
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,618
not even for the entire suite of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">Irish protocol it's mostly for the D</font>

check thing which is domain name

956
00:42:03,819 --> 00:42:11,800
checking we could have started this off

957
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,650
with let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the IETF again and try</font>

958
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,270
to standardize this but our needs are a

959
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,550
little more immediate in that we had to

960
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a replacement service for the 43</font>

961
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:23,410
side to accommodate our our delegation

962
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,640
model changes we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to arm our needs a</font>

963
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,410
little more media than what the ITF

964
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,210
could probably deliver from a standard

965
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,670
now that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to prevent us from</font>

966
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:32,829
going to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other rirs or going to the</font>

967
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,270
IETF and try to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a standard</font>

968
00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:40,390
format so we could do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the future</font>

969
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:43,630
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the table but it's not</font>

970
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:45,220
where we wanted to start so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font>

971
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,230
actually get a cut here because we're

00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">running a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tight on time so that</font>

973
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,440
way people get her out but i'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

974
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,910
iron folks will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be available for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

questions apologies for cutting your

of thanks for their presentation
