and IP address management mostly which

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,500
has been turned into an acronym as DDI

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,390
so if you hear that acronym and you

12

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what that is until now then</font>

lot with enterprise networks are the

biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of our customer base our</font>

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,799
enterprise networks and we my own role

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,439
in the company is an ipv6 evangelist and

19
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do is try to get</font>

20
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,029
enterprise networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and IT</font>

21
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,039
administrators and CIOs to think about

what they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need to do to</font>

23
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:24,899
adopt ipv6 and so there's a lot of

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,869
explaining and cajoling and browbeating

25
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:29,850
and whatever I can do to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them</font>

26
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,210
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about the task that's in front</font>

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,829
of them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you might imagine</font>

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,880
most enterprise networks are pretty much

29
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,380
safely ensconced behind nat using

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,749
private address space in the before

31
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,009
realm and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not in many cases</font>

32
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:45,390
really all that concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

33
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,640
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to need to do internally</font>

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their networks to adopt ipv6 so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,240
part of that role<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we would try to</font>

36
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:56,009
get them to set aside thinking about

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,530
doing dopey things like deploying that

38
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,880
66 and ula internally<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the network if</font>

39
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,329
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really thinking about what</font>

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,908
that might mean down the road but part

41
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,008
of the role is also figuring out what we

42
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,020
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do on the product side to make</font>

43
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:13,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that whatever features that we have</font>

44
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,180
an ipv4 that there's some roadmap is

45
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,220
supporting them in ipv6 because I think

46
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a recognition that</font>

47
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,580
v4 v6 feature parity is a necessary if

48
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,340
not sufficient condition for ipv6

49
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,920
adoption for both enterprise and service

50
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,810
provider networks so my presentation

51
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">today I'm going to talk about one</font>

52
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,040
feature in particular DHCP

53
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,900
fingerprinting and the goal of really

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,620
making sure that we future proof that

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,660
feature with dhcpv6 and the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we need a DHCP fingerprinting</font>

57
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,510
solution in the first place which has

58
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:51,840
everything to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with BYOD and so with</font>

59
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,209
that I'll go to the first slide here so

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,130
the agenda today I'm going to talk about

61
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,810
what BYOD is if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of it</font>

62
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,370
been living under a rock or working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

63
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,350
a service provider you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea what</font>

64
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I will go into DHCP</font>

65
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,630
fingerprinting we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how it</font>

66
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,489
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ipv4 and we're going to take a</font>

67
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,680
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fingerprinting data that</font>

68
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,270
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually have dhcp</font>

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,340
fingerprinting do what it's supposed to

70
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,130
do and then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about possible</font>

71
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,610
benefits of fingerprinting in both the

72
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">ACP v4 and v6 land and the differences</font>

73
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">in how v6 dhcp fingerprinting works and</font>

74
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,160
then finally the potential value<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:35,209
building an open database for dhcpv6

76
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:38,670
fingerprints so really the goal with

77
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,290
DHCP fingerprinting just to sort of

78
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">state it in a nutshell before we start</font>

79
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:47,970
out is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really provide some basic</font>

80
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:51,720
level of device type and os detection at

81
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:54,060
the level of the DHCP transaction and as

82
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,370
we'll see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't really designed to</font>

83
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,250
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard core security feature on</font>

84
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,080
corporate and enterprise networks but

85
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,450
really rather a way of just providing a

86
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,220
basic level of initial validation and

87
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,410
we'll see how we're going to be able to

88
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,870
act on the data that DHCP fingerprinting

89
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,730
gives us about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make some</font>

90
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,010
policy choices about how we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font>

91
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that device on a corporate network</font>

92
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:33,440
so here's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun quiz I'm fond of</font>

93
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,479
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> see line for on the eye chart</font>

94
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,190
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mileage may vary with that one but</font>

95
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,830
of course as I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> already sort of given</font>

96
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,330
away if you haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it before</font>

97
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,120
BYOD and abbreviation for bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font>

98
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,919

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,680

100
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:54,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've heard of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that before today so that</font>

101
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,330
the general challenge again just to sort

102
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">of restate it accommodating the new</font>

103
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,990
flood of personal devices that are bring

104
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:04,380
being brought into the corporate

105

<font color="#E5E5E5">enterprise a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network environment getting</font>

106
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,380
these devices connected to the network

107
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,568
and supporting them once they're

108
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,000
connected but making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the</font>

109
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,770
devices aren't a security risk being

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,409
able to identify the device type and the

111
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,609
operating system that they're running

112
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:19,949
recognizing that some device types and

113
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,419
operating systems are potentially

114
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,750
subject to being infected with malware

115
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:26,669
more frequently than others granting

116
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,380
them access according to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

117
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:30,690
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have on the</font>

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,219
number and type of devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

120
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,830
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time as a way of refining</font>

121
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:39,150
a BYOD policy so that you actually know

122
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,460
what's connecting to the network and

123
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,138
you've got some ability to shape your

124
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,789
policy accordingly as far as what

125
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,750
devices you're going to allow to connect

126
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:50,460
and what devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> you aren't so we'll see</font>

127
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,110
that DHCP fingerprinting by itself isn't

128
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,150
really going to solve all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the BYOD</font>

129
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,529
challenges with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the flood of personal</font>

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:06,210
important sort of foundational

133
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:07,919
technology so along the lines of why the

134
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,159

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,369

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,830

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,180
incredible explosive growth and personal

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,870
so here's another graph showing pretty

157
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,430
much the same thing something

that's going to happen this year so

169
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,469
we're already at the point where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

here do we have any I'm sorry that's

181
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,880
right yeah I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say do we have</font>

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:57,339
showing the explosion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mobile devices</font>

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,089
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> at now but pretty clearly we've</font>

209
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,319
got to an inference here that if we're

woolly world outside of corporate

217
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,979
networks so with that let's talk a

218
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit about what DHCP</font>

fingerprinting is and how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> works we're</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one of the</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> needing to connect to the network</font>

224
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,200
dhcp and dhcpv6 fingerprinting have

225
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,779
promised as a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of foundational</font>

226
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,440
method for managing devices at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

227
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,640
basic level making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that we know</font>

228
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,220
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are and that they're running</font>

229
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,720
proper OS before we actually give them

230
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:20,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">an IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address and allow them onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

231
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:23,170
network so the original idea was around

232
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,459
creating a basic validation mechanism

233
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,199
and I wouldn't say a security mechanism

234
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:28,359
that's probably too strong of a word

235
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's all sorts of ways in</font>

236
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,589
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could flummox the system if</font>

237
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,550
you're really of a mind to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and of</font>

238
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:36,940
course in a corporate network

239
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,979
environment there's some presumption of

240
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,610
other layers of security that you're

241
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,200
you're providing so that you know you

242
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,810
really looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhcp fingerprinting</font>

243
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,029
to be a beginning and an ending for for

244
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,410
security for devices that are connecting

245
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:51,240
to the network but here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the goal</font>

246
00:10:49,410 --> 00:11:00,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">to determine the client type using only</font>

247
00:10:51,240 --> 00:11:02,220
data from a basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP transaction so</font>

248
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,260
here's the generic<font color="#E5E5E5"> land segment with a</font>

249
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,279
host and dhcp client as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as dhcp</font>

250
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,569
server we've got our<font color="#E5E5E5"> discover packet the</font>

251
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,490
basic method of the fingerprinting

252
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,040
technique is simple any client wishing

253
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,930
to connect to a corporate network in

254
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,640
nearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> all cases as long as the HTTP is</font>

255
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,310
involved they have to request an address

256
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,660
via DHCP and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course that means that</font>

257
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,180
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to see a discover packet on</font>

258
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,949
the wire generally that first packet

259
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,410
whether it's a discover packet an ipv4

260
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:31,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">or as we'll see later a solicit packet</font>

261
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,990
in dhcpv6 it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> contains</font>

262
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,870
sufficient data to do a basic device

263
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:41,670
type identification and os type

264
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:43,230
identification of the device so let's

265
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,630
dig into the packets and see what's

266
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on under the hood and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll blow</font>

267
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,970
this up a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit here the basic DHCP</font>

268
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,490
transaction has a number of option

269
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:56,579
fields and these are consistently unique

270
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,910
enough among individual devices that we

271
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:01,649
can read them in a particular sequence

272
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,510
and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a num the number that are</font>

characterize the device the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> types</font>

275
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,029

iphone 5 ipad 2<font color="#CCCCCC"> samsung note etc and</font>

also<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device OS which might be more</font>

284
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">this up so you can see a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

285
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,410
option 55 is the most commonly used

field for identifying the device type

287
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,149
and this is our parameter request list

288
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:47,869
so we'll expand the parameter request

289
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,589
list and take a look at some of the

290
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:53,239
parameters that are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> offered in the</font>

discover packet or the solicit a cat in

292
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,660
v6 actually it's a little bit different

293
00:12:55,369 --> 00:13:00,230
in b6 as we'll see later in the

294
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,730
presentation so we've got quite a number

295
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,079
of options here and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know it's</font>

296
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe kind of hard to see in the</font>

297
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:09,649
back of the room I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> at as</font>

298
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,089
the dhcp server that's doing the

299
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:13,459
fingerprinting I'm not really concerned

300
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,019
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the options per se each</font>

301
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,849
individual option per se of course I

302
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,290
might use those as part of you know

303
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,410
setting up the host with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proper</font>

304
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,269
address and you know DNS resolvers to

305
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,920
look at and that sort of thing but as

306
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,049
far as dhcp fingerprinting goes i'm

307
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,420
really only after the the list the

308
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:30,679
number of parameters being requested in

309
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,509
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> order that they're being presented</font>

310
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:36,220
in but it's just kind of fun to actually

311
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:36,220
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parameters that are here I</font>

312
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:40,069
don't know if anybody's ever seen this

313
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,999
before and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if your toward</font>

314
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,988
the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the room you may not be able</font>

315
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:49,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got two option 119</font>

316
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:57,470
here which is domain search it actually

317
00:13:49,040 --> 00:14:00,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">says to do RFC 3997 so I can't recall</font>

318
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:03,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever being nagged in a packet capture to</font>

319
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:06,679
go bug the IETF DHC working group to

320
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:12,860
update RFC 3997 but there it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the</font>

321
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:14,569
packet so again we're really only

322
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,220
concerned here with the the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

323
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:17,779
options<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were being presented with</font>

324
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,669
and the order that they're being

325
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:23,929
presented in and this is our list now

326
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:26,029
that we've got our ordered list and

327
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:28,509
unique parameters under option 55 and a

328
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:31,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">dhcp discover from an unknown client</font>

329
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:32,839
what do we do with it well we're going

330
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:35,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort of database to</font>

331
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,489
actually make the next step in the DHCP

332
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:38,929
finger printing process and as it turns

333
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:41,329
out there's at least one publicly

334
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:45,410
maintained source for DHCP

335
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:47,089
fingerprinting it it works in ipv4

336
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,519
because we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a relative abundance</font>

337
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,769
of client fingerprints and so finger

338
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,710
bank is maintained<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the company packet</font>

339
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:56,180
fence which offers a captive portal

340
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lucien but they've also got this public</font>

341
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,819
database of ipv4 fingerprints that can

342
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,470
be used for DHCP fingerprinting so if we

343
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,480
refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that database based on our</font>

344
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:16,940
earlier parameters we see we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

345
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:18,740
match that's a closer look and we see

346
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that list of options under</font>

347
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:26,780
option 55 in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DHCP discover packet</font>

348
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:28,430
we've got a fedora 17 client and we can

349
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,910
look at the host side of things to

350
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:39,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">verify that that's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the client</font>

351
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:40,579
in question and there we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you</font>

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">named command showing us that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

354
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,310
suspicious and you're saying okay I get

355
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,090
you know BYOD I get mobile devices being

356
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:52,670
brought in to corporate networks but

357
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:55,610
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile devices are running fedora</font>

358
00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:02,660
17 and it's a fair question here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

359
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:05,990
answer the IT administrators worst

360
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,069
nightmare properly identified by DHCP

361
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,000
fingerprinting or not I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

362
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:17,080
they're going to let you connect us to

363
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:17,080
the corporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> network yeah</font>

364
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,860
okay so really the neat thing going on

365
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:26,140
with dhcp and dhcpv6 fingerprinting is

366
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,670
that we get actionable data with no

367
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,620
additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> transactional overhead</font>

368
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,449
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dhcp discover</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and the OS type so once we have that</font>

information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know what the device</font>

377
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,400
is we can allow or disallow or

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,740
conditionally allow network access we

379

can hand it off to a captive portal type

solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we don't even have to do</font>

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if our DHCP server is savvy enough</font>

382
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,139
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you know do the basic</font>

this all with the transactional data

407
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,340
that's built into the DHCP transaction

408
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,870
so we tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> this out at infoblox</font>

409

headquarters and we had folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> just bring</font>

in whatever they wanted from home that

<font color="#E5E5E5">could actually connect up to the network</font>

412
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,959
in v4 land and we got quite a number of

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:11,500
devices you might imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were able</font>

429
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,320
solution not something that you know is

430
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:44,500
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> replace your existing security</font>

431
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,050
regime on a corporate network but nice

432
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:52,410
to have here's a sample<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of the</font>

433
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:52,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">the OS data that we saw devices and os's</font>

434
00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:00,240
so now we'll look at how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works in</font>

435
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:04,900
dhcpv6 because it's slightly different

436
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,960
and there's an issue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcpv6 that</font>

437
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,770
will prevent it from being actual

438
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,050
actually being a feature<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can use</font>

439
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same way that we were able to use</font>

440
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,990
dhcp v4 fingerprinting today so there's

441
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,899
our generic land segment again with the

442
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:22,810
dhcpv6 client dhcpv6 server and again

443
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,970
same goal identify the OS and the type

444
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:30,820
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> device that's connecting of course</font>

445
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:32,860
we've got a different set of protocols

446
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,679
that are allowing to do this allowing us

447
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:40,270
to do this I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to multicast packet</font>

448
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,560
this time around dhcpv6 solicit as you

449
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,600
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you've got the link local source</font>

450
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,550
address and the all dhcpv6 servers

451
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,679
destination address so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

452
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,899
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's multicast</font>

453
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,210
instead of broadcast of course and the

454
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,860
presumption here you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

455
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,420
much presumed that the enterprise

456
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,459
networks are not going to be using slack

457
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,140
unless it's a lab environment you know

458
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,820
you want tight control over the hosts

459
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are connecting to the network and</font>

460
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,000
you just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that sort of</font>

461
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,370
visibility and functionality and slack

462
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,170
so you know the whole reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that dhcpv6</font>

463
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,399
fingerprinting needs to be considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

464
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,170
the first place we're presuming that

465
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,490
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to continue to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP in</font>

466
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:16,450
the corporate<font color="#CCCCCC"> network environment as we</font>

467
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:19,570
adopt ipv6 internally so there's our

468
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,860
packet capture again but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this</font>

469
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,840
time around we don't have that that

470
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,370
option 55 we've got some critical

471
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,790
options which we'll take a closer look

472
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:33,189
at but the key difference is where we

473
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:36,040
had option 55 in ipv4 dhcp and dhcpv6 we

474
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this option request option six but</font>

475
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,510
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have typically fewer</font>

476
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:44,380
options that appear under option six and

477
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,920
a dhcpv6 solicit and so we may have to

478
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,660
fall back

479
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,310
to using some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other elements that</font>

480
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,190
are being presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that solicit</font>

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,170
type and<font color="#CCCCCC"> os is and that can include the</font>

483
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,480
vendor class field where its present we

484
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,220
can look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timing of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often the</font>

488

packets that could be used in this case

489
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,629
we're actually going to have enough data

490
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,950
we've got here's our our list of client

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,620
depending on how we're actually going to

do that dhcpv6 fingerprinting on the

<font color="#E5E5E5">map that back to fedora 17 but of course</font>

the fingerprint is only accounted for in

an existing dhcpv6 fingerprint database

508

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,020
you know right now because the it that

572
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,549
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something that's being</font>

573
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,168
updated on a fairly regular basis and

574
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">seems to have you no good data of course</font>

575
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:46,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is one of the issues right i mean</font>

576
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,360
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some way of validating</font>

577
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,030
the data and making sure that that it's

578
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,918
reliable you know there's a trade-off

579
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,450
because obviously we're not trying to

580
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,669
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> dat p fingerprinting this</font>

581
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,620
incredibly powerful security tool its

582
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:01,750
basic validation but you still need some

583
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:04,570
sense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database has the correct</font>

584
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,860
information so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think over time that'll</font>

585
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,289
be worked out where you know there'll be

586
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,820
a canonical source you know the goal is

587
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,080
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep it open so that you know we can</font>

588
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,639
sort of crowdsource it and make sure

589
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,559
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

590
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,610
devices accounted for the challenge

591
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,020
there of course is that you know

592
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,658
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> could introduce junk into the</font>

593
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,610

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:27,129
fingerprinting right so you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre</font>

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">sage the real question that i had</font>

597
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,570
because i was<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering what the you</font>

598
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:33,190
know how how how accurate the updates

599
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,889
have been over time in the other the

600
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,419
reason i'm inspired to this is that over

601
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,190
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns land of course we used to have</font>

602
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:41,460
this nice you know fingerprint device

603
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:45,370
and it's useless now visit that's right

604
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:48,190
so it would be really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for</font>

605
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody but I'm not volunteering to to</font>

606
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of check the history of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> v4 one</font>

607
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,959
to see how you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's been</font>

608
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,340
over time because that would give us

609
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,780
some evidence about what its gonna be

610
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,189
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> produces I I think that's</font>

611
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,840
absolutely right and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we'll</font>

612
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,780
see over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time is that initially they'll</font>

613
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,490
be it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a collaborative sort of</font>

614
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,690
crowd-sourced effort and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> open and</font>

615
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,090
then of course it'll become more

616
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,440
proprietary as more organization start

617
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,699
to actually rely on that data and that's

618
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily a bad thing but</font>

619
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,780
initially you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's better</font>

620
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:17,200
to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it open and really help drive</font>

621
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:19,178
adoption of ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any channel that we</font>

622
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,190
can and it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things</font>

623
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:24,549
that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so but good</font>

624
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,980
question Anton<font color="#E5E5E5"> capella five notes</font>

625
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,870
excellent presentation hey thanks I was

626
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,820
waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this one since we saw you</font>

627
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,310
see

628
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,260
okay I'm curious<font color="#CCCCCC"> about whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

629
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,629
you've looked at yet or if there's any

630
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,300
you know obviously just don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

631
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:41,340
it's bad it's worthless research or

632
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:44,790
information you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> regarding maybe</font>

633
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,350
time scale aspects to the clients so for

634
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">example getting your talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about here is</font>

635
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,550
just whatever you can see passively

636
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,020
which is perfectly sensible here another

637
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,320
thing that seems like it could be a

638
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:59,070
passive coral but<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the order by which</font>

639
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,020
DHCP for v6 are emitted and perhaps how

640
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,360
quickly responds<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the OS is doing</font>

641
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,680
something after it gets the first

642
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,300
response discover packets and so forth

643
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,910
some curious if you look at anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

644
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,790
that space yet yeah we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

645
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:13,890
digging into it and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we will</font>

646
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,659
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that granular with it over time the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">chat the bigger challenge that we're</font>

648
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,560
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now is and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably</font>

649
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">no surprise to folks here but you know</font>

650
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:26,129
very inconsistent behavior of dhcpv6

651
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:28,320
clients right so you know where it

652
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,620
literally changes from code revision to

653
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,780
code revision in terms of how dhcpv6

654
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:36,360
solicits are being issued and we're just

655
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,910
frankly some devices just aren't you

656
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">know providing useful information you</font>

657
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:45,120
know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

658
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:46,110
generating dhcpv6 solicits based on the

659
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,610
fact that they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> properly</font>

660
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:51,629
supporting v6 even though they claim

661
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:53,969
that they are so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think over time as we</font>

662
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:57,210
as we see more you know development

663
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:59,040
sincere development of devices mobile

664
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,930
devices that support ipv6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get</font>

665
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,110
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious about you know writing</font>

666
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:07,680
the right proper code for supporting

667
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:09,719
ipv6 and you know that that filters down

668
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,490
to what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the dhcpv6 layer</font>

669
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,320
I'm hopeful that that will allow us then

670
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,270
to look at more you know granular

671
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,250
aspects of what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font>

672
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,320
accurately identify the device types but

673
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,790
when you have dhcpv6 clients that are

674
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,620
sort of all over the map in terms of

675
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,659
their you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know either whether or not</font>

676
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,310
they work at all or whether or not they

677
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,380
work reliably then that's sort of a

678
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,850
larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue at least initially so</font>

679
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,920
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

680
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,929
signs a little bit of light on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

681
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,600
maybe puts a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more pressure on the</font>

682
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:40,080
mobile device manufacturers to code

683
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,418
dhcpv6 a little better thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sure</font>

684
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,230
thank you

685
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:49,900
math<font color="#CCCCCC"> moorcroft not at amazon um to put a</font>

686
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:53,860
provider spin on this would this be

687
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:56,409
useful for you know identifying cpe out

688
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,510
on a cable network or something like

689
00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:01,179
that so you could identify you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

690
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:04,090
especially when they have firmware

691
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:05,590
issues and things like that yeah that's

692
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,000
a great inference and absolutely I mean

693
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the extent that year you know you're</font>

694
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,110
willing to deploy dhcpv6 in that

695
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,600
environment then they're absolutely

696
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,100
isn't any reason why this wouldn't work

697
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,020
and again give you some basic level of

698
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,879
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> and type validation and I can see</font>

699
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be extremely useful where you</font>

700
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,419
you know you have an environment where

701
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,340
folks can buy their own cpe and connect

702
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:25,990
it up and then perhaps you can have a

703
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,379
policy that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the back end that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

704
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:31,150
know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP server is actually</font>

705
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,159
exporting the important data that allows

706
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,169
you then to to script things and

707
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,510
provision accordingly based on the

708
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,669
device that's being connected so you

709
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,020
know it just depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how how</font>

710
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:44,980
labor-intensive you want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it</font>

711
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:47,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was actually thinking also if you know</font>

712
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,620
you see a new cpe behind a cable modem

713
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:52,960
then at least you know if someone calls

714
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,939
in and goes hey I've I've got a problem

715
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,799
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't work anymore you're hey</font>

716
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,320
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new router yeah exactly</font>

717
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,639
yeah yeah it's very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basic and</font>

718
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,289
that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really in the spirit of</font>

719
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,610
what fingerprinting is for is basic

720
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:05,440
validation and in that case obviously

721
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:08,620
you can really improve your operational

722
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:14,380
offering to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer so yeah good</font>

723
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:16,270
point yes David Barack ATT consulting is

724
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,360
there is there any<font color="#CCCCCC"> concern about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

725
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,350
false identification or masquerading

726
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,139
yeah I think so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that's</font>

727
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,699
clearly a risk here and and again you

728
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,740
know you you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of take the</font>

729
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,360
feature for what it is and not try to

730
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,789
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it do more than that and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

731
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,590
we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it as sort of low-hanging</font>

732
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:34,390
fruit in an enterprise environment where

733
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,500
chances are you've already got you know

734
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,720
you may already have a mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

735
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,299
management system running you might

736
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,240
already be using knack of some sort you

737
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:46,450
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just another layer of</font>

738
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:50,260
device identification validation not

739
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:52,149
necessarily security but because we're

740
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,950
talking about an enterprise network

741
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:54,649
environment again access to the wire and

742
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font>

743
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,920
other layers of security that are there

744
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got problem with somebody</font>

745
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,700
infiltrating the building and connecting

746
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,929
things up that shouldn't be there you

747
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,050
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's that sort of trade off</font>

748
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,370
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risks are offset I</font>

749
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,810
think by the fact that you're in a much

750
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">more lockdown environment in the first</font>

751
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,350
place and you know but you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

752
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,149
clear-eyed about everyone should be

753
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,679
clear-eyed about what the feature is and

754
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,970
isn't and it's it's never going to be

755
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,910
designed to be you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy duty</font>

756
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,500
security feature and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always that</font>

757
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,330
risk that you could certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

758
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,130
do some spoofing or or you know

759
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:27,590
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain access to the network</font>

760
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:30,290
by gaming the dhcp server with a

761
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,970
fingerprint that you know you say your

762
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:35,510
device is one type and it's actually

763
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:36,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else for instance I'm sorry</font>

764
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,650
we're gonna have to cut off questions as

765
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've run over at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point sorry about</font>

766
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,580
that I'm sure be glad to take more

767
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions outside yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely right</font>

768
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,750
thanks a lot time all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font>

769
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:00,330
you
