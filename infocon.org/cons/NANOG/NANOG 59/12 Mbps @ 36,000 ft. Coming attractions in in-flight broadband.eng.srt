1
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,140
I'm just confirming here i did get word

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,460
that not only has the website back up

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,860
thank you very much for doing that but

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,970
the agenda items for the few agenda

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,470
changes have made<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this afternoon</font>

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,259
looks like they are live so please go

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,869
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and check the agenda online so you</font>

8
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:36,790
know what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this morning so</font>

9
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:43,420
right now i<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to invite girish up q</font>

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:44,680
ish there we go and something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">find really interesting to learn about</font>

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:53,010
some advancements in guess internet on

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,010
aeroplanes right<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent thank you</font>

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:13,690
good afternoon so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us travel very</font>

15
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:18,240
frequently on airplanes and most of us

16
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:21,220
traveled on airplanes to get here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,570
when you're on an airplane you know some

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:31,930
of us sign up for internet access on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:39,359
airplane<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the speeds and the page</font>

20
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:43,990
load times page load times tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,210
somewhat slow so what we wanted to do

22
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,039
was to reimagine what a high-speed

23
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,788
connectivity on an airplane would look

24
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:54,910
like and so we went about building a

25
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:58,450
system that is going to it's currently

26
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:04,149
trialing on jetblue and very soon

27
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:08,380
reunited so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

28
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:11,709
is some of the ingredients that go into

29
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:15,130
building such a system so it's pretty

30
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:17,050
high level<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an overview talk but</font>

31
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:24,730
if you want to get into the details of

32
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:27,300
it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me offline where am i</font>

33
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,299
committing to you

34
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,050
ok

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:37,190
so imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were working at home and</font>

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:42,079
you know your dining area to keyboard

37
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:44,980
and now you've decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to catch a flight</font>

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,900
and it wouldn't be nice to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

39
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,810
get the same sort of experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

40
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:58,489
were getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> at home up in the air right</font>

41
00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:00,830
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on do this</font>

42
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:05,329
because you know sign up for internet

43
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:07,610
service essentially to check emails to

44
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:12,280
connect to do some work<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

45
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:14,780
could also watch video in addition to

46
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,970
doing skype<font color="#CCCCCC"> calls and all these other</font>

47
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:23,599
sorts of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you normally do at</font>

48
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:26,420
home so what you know most most people

49
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,190
you know what it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

50
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:33,018
uptake rate on internet services is

51
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,950
somewhat<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited in airplanes for two</font>

52
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:39,350
reasons one its slow second people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

53
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,589
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it jetblue announced</font>

54
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:45,980
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called fly fi which is Wi-Fi</font>

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:49,069
on airplanes which provides two things

56
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:57,440
free and fast internet service<font color="#E5E5E5"> only in</font>

57
00:03:49,069 --> 00:04:01,970
the air so what we decided to do is to

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:05,299
offer 12 mega bets to each passenger so

59
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:08,450
today most planes get probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a t1 type</font>

60
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:11,450
connection to the plane what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

61
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:17,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">could get high speed 12 megabit to each</font>

62
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:20,298
passenger and so when our during our

63
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,359
trials we're finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

64
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:24,650
compared to some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

65
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,880
experiences that you have today we can

66
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:32,349
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> pages loading</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 to 10 times faster</font>

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,080
or sometimes even higher than that and

68
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:40,320
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that go</font>

69
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">into building such a system and</font>

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,490
um I know some of you are familiar with

71
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,220
wide blue the service provider satellite

72
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,880
service provider that you know I've

73
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,710
heard it talked about and compared

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,000
against I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

75
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,260
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some comparison about</font>

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,740
performance of various ISPs under rain

77
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:10,680
and so on anyway why is that a brief

78
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">overview is a service provider it's also</font>

79
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,480
a communications technology company and

80
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:21,210
it's also a satellite operator we have a

81
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:26,150
growing number of satellites that we

82
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:29,609
either build we have recently recently

83
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,159
launched viasat-1 which one they

84
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:37,230
guinness world record in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

85
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,360
capacity on the satellite so it takes a

86
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,450
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into building a</font>

87
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:47,070
twelve- service to a passenger the first

88
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:49,400
thing that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to happen is you</font>

89
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,520
know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to some basic</font>

90
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:56,870
communication theory and um much like

91
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Moore's law there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shannon's law of</font>

92
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,690
channel information capacity so see

93
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,960
there represents channel capacity it

94
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,410
says channel capacity is directly

95
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,870
proportional to the bandwidth and is

96
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:15,750
related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to logarithmically to the</font>

97
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">signal-to-noise ratio you get you can</font>

98
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,120
get so it directly tells you what sort

99
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:26,700
of lever is you have to push and pull in

100
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:29,940
order to drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> more capacity so this</font>

101
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:34,500
this random coding bound is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of</font>

102
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:38,240
an upper bound on capacity um and you're

103
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,310
better off trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive bandwidth up</font>

104
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,810
because it has a direct ratio as opposed

105
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,210
to a logarithmic ratio of signal noise

106
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,190
ratio so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did</font>

107
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:53,719
was to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> really high capacity</font>

108
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:56,850
lights so if you the the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why most</font>

109
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,330
most air-to-ground systems don't work

110
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,580
fast is simply because the be the

111
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:09,000
bandwidth is small it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

112
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:13,020
a few megahertz and that's partly

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,570
because on the spectrum avail available

114
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,039
at that FCC grants out is in small

115
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:21,960
chunks because it's highly desirable

116
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:24,950
spectrum in the lower band so the in the

117
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:28,310
chart that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see there there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are bands</font>

118
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:31,349
called el band which is typically in the

119
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:34,680
slightly above cellular coverage in you

120
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,690
know it's typically in your home you

121
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,700
know cordless telephone range and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

122
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:42,480
you have ka-band which is typically in

123
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:44,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 to 14 gigahertz and que ce aku</font>

124
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:51,110
van and cave and it's somewhere between

125
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:55,560
20 and 30 years so those higher

126
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,600
frequencies tend to bring with it some

127
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,040
challenges and so the other lower

128
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,110
frequencies tend to be much more

129
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,840
frequently used and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

130
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">economics dictate that you know when</font>

131
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,539
there is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> demand the price goes up</font>

132
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:16,230
and so and as a commodity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in</font>

133
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:18,990
also doled out very you know it's

134
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,400
rationed out by the FCC so when you have

135
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,930
limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth he will drop</font>

136
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,390
information capacity is going to be

137
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:29,700
small and so the other aspect of it is

138
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:33,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">that when you have lots of bandwidth and</font>

139
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:37,020
you have the the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use those</font>

140
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:43,109
that bandwidth then come in separately

141
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:45,000
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can drive service prices down so you</font>

142
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:50,520
know information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font>

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,440
of recap as like a capacity is like it's

144
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,939
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like water being carried through</font>

145
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pipe the bigger the pipe the more</font>

146
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,470
water you can carry through it so if you

147
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,589
take hey you been you know like your

148
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,380
direct your home

149
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:05,269
dish or directv type applications they

150
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,000
tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to operate in the Caliban and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

151
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:10,399
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug in chug you know</font>

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,160
signal-to-noise ratios the maximum

153
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">capacity that you can drive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of those</font>

154
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,339
types of satellites and<font color="#CCCCCC"> values like you</font>

155
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:24,920
know a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> tens of megabits per second</font>

156
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:26,930
so given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know this</font>

157
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">is same problem exists in the cellular</font>

158
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:38,469
world so on the left is shown k you cut

159
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,760
the yellow spot covers all of the US and

160
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,519
it's a que you banned satellite that

161
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,880
covers all of the US but another way is

162
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,149
to use ka-band and you have spot beams

163
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:56,540
much like the terrestrial cellular

164
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:58,639
networks that you find all over so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

165
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,349
know given that you know you got some

166
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:04,300
bandwidth to play with what else can you

167
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:08,420
do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it well can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you squeeze more</font>

168
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:14,420
juice out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lemon you know so can</font>

169
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:17,120
you get more colors colors allow you to

170
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,529
represent information you know it

171
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,240
different colors allow you to

172
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:25,339
discriminate between regions so in

173
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,819
mathematics there's this thing called a

174
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:34,670
four color theorem it says if you have a

175
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:38,089
map that's divided into regions no more

176
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:40,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">than four colors are required to color</font>

177
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,819
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> regions so that no two adjacent</font>

178
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:48,589
regions have the same color so that's a

179
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:52,219
very important thing that's used often

180
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:57,079
in cellular telephony and also in spot

181
00:10:52,220 --> 00:11:01,880
beam satellites and so what we do is

182
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:03,079
extract more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more more colors out of</font>

183
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,000
the given bandwidth by using

184
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,209
polarization and polarization is a

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,620
little bit think of polarization an easy

186
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,349
way to think about it is you know you

187
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,580
tie a string to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

188
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:18,130
a fixed and fixed point and then you

189
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,690
wiggle the string one way and you have

190
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,720
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> generate transverse waves</font>

191
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:26,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">going one way any wiggle with string in</font>

192
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,830
in the orthogonal way and you generate

193
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,870
waves<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to a normal way so</font>

194
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:36,700
electromagnetic waves are somewhat like

195
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:39,070
that and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> cut</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they can</font>

196
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,570
be used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create colors in adjacent</font>

197
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,120
regions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

198
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,790
do is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of spectrum you</font>

199
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,410
can carve out channels and then add

200
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:54,880
colors that way so so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the ways</font>

201
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:57,430
in which you can get more on capacity

202
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,970
essentially driving up the be in

203
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:04,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">shannon's or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Shannon Hartley theorem and</font>

204
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:10,660
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do with our with our</font>

205
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:15,490
with our network the other challenge is

206
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:18,910
coverage and typically satellite

207
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,460
operators tend to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trade between</font>

208
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:25,420
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two dimensions they you know it's</font>

209
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:27,040
it's either coverage or capacity and so

210
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,800
with this new class of satellites what

211
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,630
we have done you know so on the on on on

212
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,500
your right you'll see sort of the

213
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:38,310
traditional clustering of satellites

214
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,640
that have more or less chosen coverage

215
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:43,780
over capacity and with the new class of

216
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,540
satellites you know it's called

217
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-throughput satellites we're trying</font>

218
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,620
to drive more capacity and with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

219
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,650
generation of satellites that we just

220
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced it there's also we're driving</font>

221
00:12:53,650 --> 00:13:01,030
to higher coverage areas as well and on

222
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:03,609
the top right side you'll see on pretty

223
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:06,520
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> coverage that you'll see across</font>

224
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:11,110
on the Atlantic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means is</font>

225
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:13,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get when you're flying from from</font>

226
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,730
u.s. to Europe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get very</font>

227
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:25,060
high-speed connectivity across the

228
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:30,120
Atlantic as well so yeah so the program

229
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:35,739
that were trialing out now is for large

230
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:38,560
large body aircraft primarily jetblue

231
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,320
and united continental fleet of the

232
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:48,250
United<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will be available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

233
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:51,490
83 2737 757 and Embraer<font color="#CCCCCC"> jets totals</font>

234
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:56,860
about 400 aircraft and we're providing

235
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:58,570
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air time services on it so let's</font>

236
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:04,510
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little bit into the</font>

237
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:07,960
technical components that comprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

238
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:13,780
service so on the on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> right on</font>

239
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:17,110
you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the antenna and a you know</font>

240
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:19,990
a yellow box that sits inside the cabin

241
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">now the antenna sits on a raid own it's</font>

242
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:27,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a little a little bump it's about</font>

243
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">um about yay big on that sits on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top</font>

244
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,890
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> fitting on top of the</font>

245
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:38,740
aircraft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the antenna sits inside on</font>

246
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:40,510
and there or is a power supply there is

247
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,410
an internal control unit and so on and

248
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:50,340
and then it talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the satellite it's</font>

249
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:55,870
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to receive and transmit on from a</font>

250
00:14:50,340 --> 00:15:00,070
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the antenna there on the</font>

251
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:03,940
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left side you'll see sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

252
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:06,370
big antenna and you'll see something

253
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,490
called an smt SN modulator it's a very

254
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,990
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplified diagram of all of the</font>

255
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:15,970
components<font color="#E5E5E5"> that go into the hub and I'll</font>

256
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:18,130
get into that in the next few slides but

257
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,600
suffice it to say that base station you

258
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:23,050
know it's similar to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cellular</font>

259
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,270
telephony network and the base stations

260
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,069
basically back all the traffic into or

261
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> run you know</font>

262
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:31,200
the ran traffic into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> and evolve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packet</font>

263
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:41,280
core and from the core you get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

264
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:45,360
to the internet so i was talking briefly

265
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:49,260
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> antenna the it shown in the</font>

266
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,870
picture is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the antenna on your right in</font>

267
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,780
the middle is a modem that's able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

268
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:58,050
transmit and receive and a power<font color="#CCCCCC"> supply</font>

269
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:00,480
in it so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the three sort of</font>

270
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,969
line replaceable units and then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

271
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,020
next to the antenna something called an

272
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:10,350
internal control unit so what happens is

273
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:14,699
we get telemetry and GPS information and

274
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:16,770
then drive the antenna to point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

275
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,600
satellite at all times so unlike the

276
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:21,480
air-to-ground system which work at lower

277
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,740
frequencies where you can have sort of

278
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">omnidirectional antennas here you can</font>

279
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:31,650
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have very high directivity</font>

280
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,930
antennas and what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means is that as</font>

281
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aircraft is moving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around you have</font>

282
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">to keep the end and appointed at the</font>

283
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,219
satellite all the time and so you need

284
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,960
to know at all times where the satellite

285
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:48,050
is where they enter the aircraft is in

286
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,510
relation to the satellite so we steer

287
00:16:48,050 --> 00:17:00,060
the antenna based on information<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

288
00:16:51,510 --> 00:17:04,199
from from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS units mounted next to</font>

289
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:06,208

293
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:22,109

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:25,380
minimize aerodynamic load and also

295
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:27,540

297
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,000
it's a change to the body of the

298
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:35,100

make it flight-worthy

302
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,730
and at all you know the radome also has

to be designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have RF</font>

313
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:20,130
operates at two levels it operates that

314
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:22,919
the phy layer where it does modulation

315
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,470
and demodulation of signals<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar in a</font>

317

318
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:36,539
correction coding and it does by layer

319
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,700
algorithms in dealing with fades and it

320
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:40,710
deals with power managing power and

321
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:44,460
timing and so on much like what happens

322
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:48,570
on the ethernet interfaces on

323
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,370
terrestrial networks and only or optical

324
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:55,500
things that you know the previous one of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the previous speakers talked about then</font>

326
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:03,860
it also deals with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac layer I'm similar</font>

327
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:06,659
to the ethernet framing there is sort of

328
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:09,510
there is a framing that's used here and

329
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:12,510
what it does MT stands for mobile

330
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,879
terminal mobile terminal needs to log

331
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:18,270

334
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:28,799
receive so so that's the set of

335
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,889
functions of the mac layer protocols in

336
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:35,549
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> it provides radio resource</font>

337
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:39,450

338
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:43,850
for managing the quality of service

339
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:47,700
provided to that particular terminal so

340
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:49,379
IP tuples are typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> mapped into what</font>

341
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,030
are called service flows which are

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,850
architectural primitives that are used

343
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,530
in the matter

344
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:58,689
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> two to provide no quality of</font>

345
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:01,240
differentiated quality of service for

346
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,789
different applications and the mac layer

347
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,840
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> deals with congestion control and</font>

348
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:10,299
load balancing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the satellite beam</font>

349
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,490
furthermore it deals with hand over as

350
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:16,720
the aircraft transitions in a ghost

351
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:18,880
across the country it goes from one spot

352
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,450
beam to the other much like as you're

353
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,760
driving along<font color="#E5E5E5"> a road on a freeway you're</font>

354
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,789
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one cell tower to the up next</font>

355
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,580
or one sector within a cell tower to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

356
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:33,450
next sector within a cell tower so there

357
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:41,918
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> these handover algorithms that um</font>

358
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:48,100
come into play<font color="#E5E5E5"> that essentially allow</font>

for seamless connectivity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

362
00:20:51,490 --> 00:21:00,539
connected to in<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition we also enhance</font>

363
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:04,539
some of the protocols to deal with a

364
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:05,919
satellite to satellite handover so in in

365
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,990
some areas where there is limited

366
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,350
coverage we have other satellites sort

367
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:13,450
of taking over so we need to end traffic

368
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:21,070
from one satellite to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next and that</font>

369
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:25,230
poses its own set of challenges so from

370
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:28,780
a mobility architecture perspective we

371
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:31,990
again like as mentioned before there's a

372
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,480
number of protocols designed to deal

373
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:39,630
with handover but fundamentally there's

374
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:43,000
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> csn or connectivity serving network</font>

375
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:46,750
that talks to multiple access serving

376
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,140
networks or and then what is shown at

377
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:54,130
the bottom is as mobile terminals move

378
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:56,200
from one smt SOS NTS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically deals</font>

379
00:21:54,130 --> 00:22:01,460
with one particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> spot beam to the</font>

380
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:05,120
other the protocols tell

381
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,919
one base station to hand over the mobile

382
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,320
terminals context<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what does a</font>

383
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,330
context context is really information

384
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the terminal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or what its</font>

385
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:17,539
capabilities are if you're if you're

386
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:20,330
authenticated or not if you're if you

387
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:23,419
have keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have encrypted</font>

388
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:25,668
information or is or what kind of keys

389
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:28,510
or need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be handed over all of that</font>

390
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:33,020
context moves along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the terminal</font>

391
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:36,220
during the course of the flight so all

392
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:40,129
of the traffic from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminal goes to</font>

393
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:42,799
via the base stations to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Athens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

394
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:45,529
the connectivity serving networks and

395
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:54,139
out to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet so that's sort of</font>

396
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:56,450
the basic high level architecture and

397
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:00,200
like I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the user</font>

398
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:05,289
services persist through persist through

399
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:07,909
the handoff process what that means is

400
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:10,789
pages continue to load video streams

401
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:13,220
continue and email and VPN services

402
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:16,190
continue so there is a brief hiccup when

403
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:19,929
when for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I talked about</font>

404
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:23,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> colors and adjacent beams and</font>

405
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:25,640
when when a plane goes from one

406
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,200
satellite beam to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next satellite</font>

407
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,260
beams if if it goes to a different

408
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,240
polarization the physical layer needs to

409
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,789
switch over so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a very very short</font>

410
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,460
outrage causing a few lost packets but

411
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:40,490
it's no different than any you know

412
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:46,960
indistinguishable from what happens on

413
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:46,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so that's</font>

414
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:55,290
here's a little more detail about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

415
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:59,160
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it consists of a set of</font>

416
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:01,620
satellite radio access nodes connected

417
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,660
to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> evil packet core there are several</font>

418
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,350
nodes in the packet core we call them

419
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:09,060
core nodes and they're like internet

420
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,520
points of presence they provide

421
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,520
connectivity<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop-off points to the</font>

422
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet at each of these quarter notes</font>

423
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:21,540
the in you know we have one big ospf

424
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:29,730
area that connects all of the satellite

425
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:37,670
lands to the packet core and we use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CG</font>

426
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:40,860
not for passengers and we have to buy

427
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:43,680
aircraft or airline regulations how<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

428
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:47,070
have to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> content filtering so</font>

429
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:51,000
that you know passengers are not subject

430
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:52,700
to objectionable content so that's a

431
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:01,430
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network infrastructure</font>

432
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:04,380
and in terms of redundancy each

433
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:08,610
satellite access node or gateway we call

434
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:13,860
them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> duo home to two nodes in the</font>

435
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:16,409
packet core and we use routing metrics

436
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:20,370
one is advertising a higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

437
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:23,670
other so when one goes away the other

438
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:26,399

briefly about what happens at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Phi</font>

what happens from a connectivity IP

446
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:53,669
connectivity standpoint but we talked a

447
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:55,620
little bit about on tcp and many of you

448
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,800
know tcp wasn't

449
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:02,100
originally designed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long fat</font>

450
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,330
networks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> since then a number of</font>

451
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">improvements have been made to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

452
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:10,320
through rfcs to improve the performance

453
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:16,440
of tcp on a long fat network in our case

454
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:18,090
the we have both high bandwidth and long

455
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,990
latencies because of the round-trip time

456
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:26,600
to a geostationary satellite so it

457
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,600
impacts a couple of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it impacts</font>

458
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:35,330
you know so TCP performance is based on

459
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:39,770
the round trip<font color="#E5E5E5"> times so the longer the</font>

460
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:44,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">round-trip the worst performance and</font>

461
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:49,170
it's also proportional to the window

462
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,120
size so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the several of the</font>

463
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:54,179
algorithm parameters are tuned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

464
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,389
slow start is directly proportional to

465
00:26:54,179 --> 00:27:00,270
the round<font color="#E5E5E5"> trip times and has a</font>

466
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:02,760
logarithmic you know response to the

467
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:08,100
window sizes so what happens in a long

468
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:12,360
delay network is because packets are in

469
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:15,590
flight and the TCP connection has to

470
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,719
stay and the buffer sizes have to be

471
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:21,059
maintained in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive higher</font>

472
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,059
performance otherwise you'll end up

473
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:27,059
getting caught up in the slow start part

474
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:33,899
of the TCP congestion algorithm and the

475
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:36,360
back off algorithm as well so we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

476
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,090
following we split the connection into

offs and so on

486
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:13,210
and and we use RFC 1323 to drive up

487
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:15,699

<font color="#CCCCCC">sustained the movement of prefixes and</font>

00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:41,500
we did was the cause significant updates

00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,929
research in this area to solving a

00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:09,570
the reverse order so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Qualcomm</font>

561
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:15,870
has recently filed a petition with the

FCC for hire we know higher bandwidth

563
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:23,000

564
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,139
types of spectrum allocation requests

565
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,899
there are a number of parties that are

566
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:33,658
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in the in the process</font>

567
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:36,959
like you pointed out on the air cell

568
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:40,950
logo is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 megahertz the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Qualcomm request</font>

569
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,649
is for 150 megahertz so it's it's 50

570
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,600
times more and the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was</font>

571
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:47,010
just talking about deals with 500

572
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,840
megahertz so which we've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

573
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:52,110
granted so there's no contention in the

574
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:56,820
spectrum allocation at all on the second

575
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:59,399
part so we all of the as planes go from

576
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:03,960
one base station to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other we're not</font>

577
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:06,689
really advertising the reach ability of

578
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,780
that aircraft from that particular base

579
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:12,119
station instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> we back all the traffic</font>

580
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,580
all over the way all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> csn</font>

581
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,349
and so there's really one point from

582
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:19,649
which we do that so it's in that sense
