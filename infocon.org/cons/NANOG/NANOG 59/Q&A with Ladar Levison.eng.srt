2
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,970
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the quick shuffle but it was</font>

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,710
important that we set this up<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,180
discussion which is exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:30,900
who in the room knows what lavabit is ok

6

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,120
the first question from from what are so

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,620
informal discussion we encourage

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:52,140
questions from the audience will ask you

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,120
just to conform to the normal guidelines

15

19
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of give some context</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,899
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a lot of hands went up for</font>

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,369
folks who understand what's going on I

22
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:12,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in-depth everybody's read</font>

23
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,149
everything know so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with</font>

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,280
wheat us a little about<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself and you</font>

25
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:20,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">know who is the DAR and started there</font>

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,490
yeah my name is Claude are and i'm a

27
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,490
nerd

28
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,949
I I guess I'm in good company no I've

29
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,520
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with computers for as long</font>

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,890
as I can remember and I I went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> school</font>

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,479
and I I tried to become one of those

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,090
finance<font color="#CCCCCC"> peaks and it just didn't work</font>

33
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,500
out so I went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to technology and</font>

34
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,619
it's been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time as a consultant</font>

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,240
working you know IT<font color="#E5E5E5"> services for</font>

36
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,799
financial companies things of that

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,570
nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also in my free time building</font>

38
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,899
this little email service that I

39
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:01,380
originally billed as a email service by

40
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,909
geeks for geeks I don't know how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

41
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,509
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but we actually started</font>

42
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,920
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the name nerd check apparently</font>

43
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,590
it was a little too nerdy for some of

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,900
our users so we changed it after a

45
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,330
couple of years into<font color="#E5E5E5"> what became love a</font>

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:19,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and you know that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

47
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,180
background so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

48
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,060
segue what is the history behind lot of

49
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was a lot of a whale of a bit and</font>

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,170
what prompted you to start nerd<font color="#E5E5E5"> shack</font>

51
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,298
and eventually a lot of it yeah well I

52
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,070
was sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this great domain name</font>

53
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:35,579
nurture calm and I just didn't know what

54
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:38,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so come April first 2004</font>

55
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:41,609
everybody remembers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that day right that</font>

56
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,560
was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first day of gmail and I was</font>

57
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:44,970
sitting around with my friends and we

58
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,310
were like well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could grab</font>

59
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,810
some open source software and some cheap

60
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,030
hard drives from the local computer

61
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,630
store and we can offer free email

62
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,810
services with large quotas to little did

63
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,269
I know how hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be but that's</font>

64
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:04,620
kind of how it started just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a project</font>

65
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it grew from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there I quickly</font>

66
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,220
realized that email is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems that's really easy to solve as</font>

68
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,150
long as you can fit everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto a</font>

69
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,819
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> server and becomes very difficult</font>

70
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,680
to solve when you try and distribute it

71
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,828
out over multiple servers at least doing

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,540
it cheaply so I effectively decided to

73
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,459
solve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem doing the one thing that</font>

74
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,819
I knew how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that was write</font>

75
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,139
code and I basically built this

76
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,720
clustered distributed system for

77
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,060
handling email probably looks a lot like

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Gmail at least from an architectural</font>

79
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,930
standpoint and it grew from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font>

80
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,640
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people ask well</font>

81
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,909
how did you become so interested in

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">protecting privacy well when I was</font>

83
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:49,709
building that platform back in 2004 a

84
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:55,260
lot of you remember that was kind of the

85
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:56,909
height of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsl scare when ISPs were</font>

86
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,349
receiving these national security

87
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:00,239
letters and not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

88
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:02,750
about them not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell us</font>

89
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">what information was being demanded and</font>

90
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,980
sort of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural reaction was why</font>

91
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,250
don't want to be put in that position so

92
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,108
I'll just develop the system so I don't

93
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any information that's or at least</font>

94
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:18,180
usable information to turn over so I

95
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:22,380
figured I didn't need to log the meta

96
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,750
information I just wouldn't I figured

97
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,490
well the one piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information that I</font>

98
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,259
would need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> store on the server that</font>

99
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,690
would be private<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I could be forced</font>

100
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,150
to turn over would be emails so I just

101
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,969
used my<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge of cryptography to</font>

102
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,620
basically encrypt everyone's emails

103
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,880
before they're written to disk so that

104
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,509
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point forward they could only</font>

105
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">be read with a person's password and the</font>

106
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:48,360
service group when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down it had</font>

107
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,699
over 410,000 registered users we're

108
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,680
seeing between<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 and 50,000 logins a</font>

109
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:58,620
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> and about 1.4 million emails a week</font>

110
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,440
certainly not up there in the grand

111
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,449
scheme of things but i think we had

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,389
definitely established ourselves as one

113
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:08,909
of the few medium-sized email service

114
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,710
providers out there sure and then you

115
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,699
know he said up until you shut down

116
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,500
right so before you cut down<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

117
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,180
foreign or 10,000 users and then you

118
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,409
shut down so it sounds like you're

119
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,970
fairly successful right things were

120
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:19,919
moving along gave getting good traffic

121
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,710
getting good logins I mean uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

122
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,799
also a paid service for users I had

123
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,750
about 10,000 paid users you know I've

124
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,669
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on it mostly full time for</font>

125
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last couple of years before that I</font>

126
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,109
had to obviously do a lot of consulting

127
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,330
work and I only got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend part of my</font>

128
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,680
time working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the service but sure you</font>

129
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,710
know it was a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I built up</font>

130
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">over time I decided very early on that I</font>

131
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,948
didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take in venture capital</font>

132
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:47,360
because I wanted to keep it true<font color="#CCCCCC"> to its</font>

133
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:49,979
sort of philosophical underpinnings and

134
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,460
you know that's where the service was I

135
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:56,460
think if I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken it very different</font>

136
00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,180
for example if i had had investors or

137
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,620
partners or for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example a huge payroll</font>

138
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,039
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been able to</font>

139
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">make the decision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i did know at the</font>

140
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,360
time i only had one<font color="#CCCCCC"> other full-time</font>

141
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:12,240
employee and he was in line with me

142
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,400
philosophically and we both kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of felt</font>

143
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,430
that you know given what the government

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,370
was asking for the only ethical thing to

145
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,740
do would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shut down the service and</font>

146
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,210
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that begs the question then you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

147
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,229
why did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dombey's the governor</font>

148
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,580

149
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:28,289
government asking for and why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

150
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,840
ultimately decide to shut down love a

151
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:33,500
bit as a response well for most of you

152
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,119
or for if any of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't know</font>

153
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,710
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fights about is whether or not</font>

154
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government can come and demand my</font>

155
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:44,960
ssl private key if there any certificate

156
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,690
authorities out there you should really

157
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,880
look into my case because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't</font>

158
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,520
protect my keys you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect your</font>

159
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,310
keys either but effectively what the

160
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,198
government said is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this law</font>

161
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,539
on the books called the pen

162
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,270
trap-and-trace law that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

163
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:06,509
monitor a service provider and collect

<font color="#CCCCCC">maeda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information who a person is</font>

165
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,729
emailing when they're logging in and

166
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,740
from where the problem was at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least with</font>

167
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:16,770
my service is all that information was

168
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,139
protected via ssl now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> most cases</font>

169
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,448
that's not an issue because<font color="#CCCCCC"> as all of</font>

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,849
you know in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases email servers</font>

171
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,380
right that data out to log files and

172
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:29,130
have it ready and available to hand over

173
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:33,449
I didn't so what the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided</font>

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:35,849
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do was demand my ssl keys crack open</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of letting me modify the software to</font>

also wouldn't provide any transparency

content and passwords you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's one</font>

on your network

189
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:12,169
it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a scary proposition from a</font>

190
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:14,720
security standpoint it's even more scary

191
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:17,299
when you take into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> that device</font>

192
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,099
has your encryption keys and can inspect

everything coming in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

195
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:28,400
is to prevent sensitive information

196
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:30,349
being picked up by eavesdroppers so you

197
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,079
know I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of left in a pickle so</font>

198
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:35,450
to speak I could log into my own network

199
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:40,789
securely my own you know web-based

200
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:43,700
administrative tools and you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

201
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">said the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the FBI investigators wouldn't</font>

202
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,270
provide me with any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of assurances</font>

203
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,449
that they were only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

204
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,550
collecting meta information in fact to

205
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> contrary when they first approached</font>

206
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">me they actually told me that they would</font>

207
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">be collecting passwords</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and content even</font>

208
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,520
though they weren't legally authorized

209
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:06,050
to do that that scared me just a little

210
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,550
bit sure so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll it back for a</font>

211
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,020
second just because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that you</font>

212
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,029
know there's there's a several small

213
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,560
operators you know here at nanigen and

214
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:14,180
then obviously larger operators in step

215
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,310
I only kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of walk through how this all</font>

216
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,079
unfolded it and what will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

217
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:22,369
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it started in about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> May or at</font>

218
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:25,149
least as far as we know yeah you know

219
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:28,339
I've gotten requests over the years

220
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:30,529
search warrants and subpoenas for user

221
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,320
information never really had a problem

222
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,600
with it because they've always been

223
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,190
narrowly tailored to demand the

224
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,980
information belonging to that specific

225
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,160
user I would run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a search on my server</font>

226
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,050
grab whatever email messages belonging

227
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,899
to that user existed on the server at

228
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,089
that time turn around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and send them off</font>

229
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:54,079
I had a little bit of meta information

230
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:56,630
in my database not much but I dump that

231
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:58,219
out and turn that over and that would be

232
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of it so I was a little</font>

233
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">surprised when come may I get home and</font>

234
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,410
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> business card on on my</font>

235
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,250
door from an FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> agent and on the back</font>

236
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,250
says we should meet

237
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,880
we ended up linking up via email setting

238
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,470
up an appointment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he came by with</font>

239
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:20,709
his partner and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent several hours</font>

240
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,709
talking and he didn't know at that time

241
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:27,680
why he was talking to me he presumed

242
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,529
that there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going an investigation</font>

243
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,949
under way involving one of my users but

244
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,870
he didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who it was it may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

245
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:39,639
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to the investigation</font>

246
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,470
that ultimately demanded my ssl<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssl keys</font>

247
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,910
there's no way of knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font>

248
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I spent several hours talking to</font>

249
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,000
him explaining to him that if it was a

250
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,680
secure account I wouldn't have any

251
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,690
emails this is how my network is

252
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,310
designed you know I don't have made

253
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:57,860
information I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a habit of</font>

254
00:10:52,310 --> 00:11:00,079
collecting it etc I also devotes my

255
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,290
deepest and darkest secrets so that he

256
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,399
conduct a background check on me

257
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,969
apparently the FBI likes working with

258
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,380
people that have security clearances and

259
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,930
that was the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

260
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,630
particular agent until June twenty

261
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:19,310
eighth when he showed up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> my door</font>

262
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:23,120
unannounced and said oh by the way I

263
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:26,599
have a warrant<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you it hasn't arrived</font>

264
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,160
yet but I was sent over here just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

265
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,050
serve you anyways and let you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

266
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,180
it was coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then of course is</font>

267
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,640
blackberry rings and the warrant arrives

268
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,079
and he forwards it to me so we're

269
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,240
sitting there talking for another two or

270
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,989
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours and I haven't seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

271
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,480
warrant that's been presented to me but

272
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,480
he claims that not only does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it provide</font>

273
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,670
them with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authority to collect made</font>

274
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:54,050
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> information but the authority to</font>

275
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:58,219
collect passwords content and requires

276
00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:01,609
me to turn over my ssl keys and of

277
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,279
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> my answer was I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

278
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,220
consult an attorney because I've never

279
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard of the FBI coming along demanding</font>

280
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,360
the private keys of a business before I

281
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,160
don't think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to explain to this</font>

282
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,709
particular audience just how important

283
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,170
those ssl keys are when it comes to

284
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:20,170
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and identity verification</font>

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,230
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of left it at that you know</font>

286
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,739
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said we ended up talking for two</font>

287
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:33,470
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three hours um why did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

288
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,810
time those jun 28 it<font color="#E5E5E5"> June twenty-eighth</font>

289
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,970
he left I didn't get a chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read</font>

290
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,739
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> warrant at that point because he'd</font>

291
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,300
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> over at like five or six o'clock</font>

292
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,389
and it was like eight or nine o'clock

293
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">before he left but monday i checked my</font>

294
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:50,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">email and they're waiting for me in my</font>

295
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,959
inbox is the original pen trap-and-trace

296
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,259
order but also in order to compel

297
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,670
apparently as soon as he left my office

298
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:00,980
he called up his friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Washington</font>

299
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,469
and they immediately filed for in order

300
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,420
to compel that same day which I thought

301
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:11,360
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit strange I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

302
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:14,089
our government moved that fast but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

303
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,680
that order to compel and at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I</font>

304
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:21,470
read everything much more carefully I

305
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,620
actually at that time thought it did

306
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:27,589
include content because it said

307
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">signaling information and I'm thinking</font>

308
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:31,579
signal-to-noise ratio well that's just

309
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:34,880
their way of referring to the

310
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:37,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">information coming across</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wire well</font>

311
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,870
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality that meant the DTMF tones</font>

312
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,699
that are go along with a telephone call

313
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I wouldn't find that out until I</font>

314
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,120
actually got a lawyer involved in my

315
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,459
case which would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> another two weeks</font>

316
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,939
but I thought they did have the

317
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:54,319
authority to collect content and I

318
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:57,380
didn't think they had the authority to

319
00:13:54,319 --> 00:14:01,519
demand my ssl keys because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the order</font>

320
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:04,839
said was technical assistance to me

321
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,630
technical assistance is assistance

322
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,309
installing their pen trap-and-trace

323
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:14,660
device you know showing them which

324
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:16,730
cables mirroring off our uplink port if

325
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,259
that's what they required something of

326
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,850
that nature but<font color="#CCCCCC"> providing the ssl keys</font>

327
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:26,329
would be going a little bit above and

328
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,939
beyond sure and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i asked them via</font>

329
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,699
email to put their<font color="#E5E5E5"> request for technical</font>

330
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:32,689
assistance in writing particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font>

331
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:35,120
they miss

332
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">voted me in the order to compel by</font>

333
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,340
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had the power to decrypt my</font>

334
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:45,620
users information I had the power but

335
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:48,560
only if I knew their password I never

336
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,850
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> that email demanding the ssl keys it</font>

337
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,959
was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were afraid to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the</font>

338
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:57,230
request in writing but about two weeks

339
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,030
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I contacted the eff by the way</font>

340
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,300
and they put me<font color="#CCCCCC"> in touch with a lawyer</font>

341
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,850
who I managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to finally link up with I</font>

342
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:08,089
spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> to her monday night tuesday</font>

343
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:10,340
morning I spoke to her again hung up the

344
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,170
phone to email her all of the documents

345
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i had seen at that point and my</font>

346
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:19,160
doorbell rang my friendly neighborhood

347
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,110
FBI agents were back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this time they</font>

348
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,329
were delivering a summons for me to

349
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,840
appear one week from that day at a

350
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:31,600
courtroom in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexandria Virginia and you</font>

351
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:34,930
live where Dallas that was a problem

352
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,730
considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lawyer I had just found</font>

353
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:40,609
was in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and couldn't even</font>

354
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,830
represent me in Alexandria so the plot

355
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:46,850
thickened<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have anything</font>

356
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:50,360
in writing demanding my ssl keys what I

357
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,860
had was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an order to show cause to show</font>

358
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,630
up in front of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> judge and explain to</font>

359
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,210
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I was refusing the pen</font>

360
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:59,030
trap-and-trace device order which in

361
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:01,340
fact I wasn't refusing I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> the agents</font>

362
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,100
that previous Friday when I met<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

363
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,500
them that if they set up an appointment

364
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,870
I'll meet them down at the data center

365
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,730
and we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that device installed the</font>

366
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,490
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue I have is turning over those</font>

367
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:17,240
SS okies apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wasn't</font>

368
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:21,080
communicated at least to the judge until

369
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:24,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">I showed up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> told well it got a</font>

370
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,180
little more interesting obviously the

371
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,189
lawyer who I had been working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

372
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,810
couldn't help me because just of the

373
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:34,880
logistical issues she communicated that

374
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:37,000
back to the Department of Justice and

375
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,830
they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit me with an extra a</font>

376
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,720
subpoena at that point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font>

377
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:45,110
first piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper I had demanding the</font>

378
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,550
ssl keys also demanding that i appear

379
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,950
before a grand jury in prison

380
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,890
those keys the<font color="#E5E5E5"> following tuesday at that</font>

381
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,300
same day that summons was ok let me stop

382
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,880
you for a second good<font color="#CCCCCC"> air because you've</font>

383
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,140
gotten these requests from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FBI in</font>

384
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,430
the orig original warrant and then there

385
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,640
was you have an additional information

386
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually asking for the selkies but</font>

387
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">during this whole case you're also</font>

388
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:08,750
compelled not to tell me what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

389
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:12,589
right yeah that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

390
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,170
disturbing aspects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it</font>

391
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit me our governments gotten smart if</font>

392
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,610
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to break the rules and</font>

393
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:20,720
violate<font color="#CCCCCC"> Constitution they've realized</font>

394
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that all they have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is make it</font>

395
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">illegal for anybody who knows about it</font>

396
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:28,820
to tell anybody that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way if anybody says</font>

397
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,920
hey you're violating the Constitution

398
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're breaking the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> law they go to jail</font>

399
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,809
sure which you did write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

400
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,580
this at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point you you told them</font>

401
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:38,928
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be complicit</font>

402
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,409
right that handed over those keys would

403
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:44,030
give them access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font>

404
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:47,120
well I did everything I could to oppose

405
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:52,309
the request within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boundaries of the</font>

406
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,139
law I showed up in Alexandria and I

407
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:56,210
explained<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the judge that I was in</font>

408
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,790
fact willing to let them install that

409
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:02,300
trap and trace device and that's when

410
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:04,730
the prosecutor for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Department of</font>

411
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,649
Justice stood up and said well that's

412
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,780
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issue here the issue is the ssl</font>

413
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,730
keys and there's a great quote in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

414
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,309
transcripts where the judge basically

415
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,620
says well that original order didn't

416
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:17,240
give you the authorization to demand

417
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,620
those keys it was only for the trap<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

418
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:24,380
trace device and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like he's</font>

419
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:29,418
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let you install it duh so why</font>

420
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:33,520
did I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fly a thousand miles but I</font>

421
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:36,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">also requested that the case be unsealed</font>

422
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,650
on the grounds that I thought the rest

423
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,629
of you needed to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was going on</font>

424
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,850
namely that the feds were coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> along</font>

425
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,679
and demanding these<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL keys from</font>

426
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,719
private businesses and all the

427
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,580
implications that go along with that and

428
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,690
the prosecutor made that very same case

429
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,730
the judge and the judge still said no

430
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,200
but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> did grant a continuance and that</font>

431
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,620
gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me time to retain</font>

432
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,409
turning and given that I'm the Patriot

433
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,870
that I am I thought all I had to do was

434
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:10,760
hire a lawyer who could explain to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

435
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:14,149
judge just how important these keys were

436
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,210
and why there was no law on the books

437
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:20,299
that allowed them to collect them and

438
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:25,880
the issue would go away did it I was

439
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:29,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrong tell my believe it was around</font>

440
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,870
August fourth the judge<font color="#CCCCCC"> ruled on the</font>

441
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:34,879
motion to quash denied it and demanded

442
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:38,209
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn over the keys by 10 a.m. the</font>

443
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,419
following morning well lucky for me I

444
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,700
had printed out the keys and put them in

445
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:47,269
an envelope when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went to DC for that's</font>

446
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,830
grand jury subpoena appearance they by

447
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,049
the way they had released me from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

448
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:55,158
appearance so that's why i didn't get to

449
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:56,240
turn over the keys then but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i still had</font>

450
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,679
that envelope what would have happened

451
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,029
if you hadn't do so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said you</font>

452
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,309
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> an early keys by 10 a.m. the next</font>

453
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:02,240
day yeah there's probably nor what when

454
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:05,649
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with the government right</font>

455
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,880
Oh or it'll be a thousand dollars a day

456
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:09,439
so I thought well I already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font>

457
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,169
envelope<font color="#E5E5E5"> but these keys print it out</font>

458
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,240
might as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well just turn that over after</font>

459
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,070
all that is surrendering the information

460
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the federal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government sure didn't</font>

461
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,360
say in the the order what format it had

462
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:25,250
to be in so specifically in the envelope

463
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:29,209
there's pages with printed out 2056 2048

464
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:33,529
byte keys yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i was using</font>

465
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:36,139
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pem format my files had the</font>

466
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:38,570
certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the entire certificate</font>

467
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:41,719
chain in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same file okay and it was</font>

468
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:44,510
five keys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had five certificates</font>

469
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:49,639
five certificate chains and five private

470
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:52,879
keys in total it was about 11 pages 11

471
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:56,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">bedrich sounds a little short 11 pages i</font>

472
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,559
believe it was eight point font

473
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,820
and and I noticed that you know what is

474
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,770
it only about a hundred and twenty

475
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,559
characters or 80 characters that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PEM</font>

476
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:17,049
format loops around so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I decided that I</font>

477
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:19,389
could do two columns I was nice though I

478
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:21,549
included lying numbers just in case they

479
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,620
got lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps track where you're at</font>

480
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:25,179
when you're typing it back in yeah and

481
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,239
so what was the response then so you

482
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:30,640
provided this and did that satisfy the

483
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they came back to following monday</font>

484
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,140
and said we're hitting you with a

485
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,200
five-thousand-dollar fine starting now

486
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">and for every 24 hours that it takes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

487
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,490
you to turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the CD we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

488
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with an additional five thousand</font>

489
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:49,120
and oh by the way we can't come pick up

490
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:53,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">the keys tonight at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm so</font>

491
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:56,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was at least going to be two days so I</font>

492
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,419
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stretch it out and just give</font>

493
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,809
myself as much time as possible because

494
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:04,690
I had resolved long before that that if

495
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:06,428
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced to surrender those keys the</font>

496
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,940
only ethical choice would be to shut

497
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:13,260
down the service the only issue was do i

498
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:16,450
shut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down for 24 hours in protest or</font>

499
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:19,120
permanently until you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is</font>

500
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,500
resolved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the courts and when I got</font>

501
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,539
hit with a ten-thousand-dollar fine i

502
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,830
thought well<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was my margin for</font>

503
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:30,279
error I better stay shut down until the

504
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">case resolves itself and if I win open</font>

505
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:34,630
the service back up and if I lose turn

506
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,840
it over to somebody who doesn't mind

507
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,820
living abroad<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya know it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out that</font>

508
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,549
actually handing over the keys in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

509
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,529
printed out format not only probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

510
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:45,970
little jab but also ended up maybe

511
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,700
having a positive influence on the case

512
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,830
overall yeah one thing that my lawyer

513
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,899
was nice enough to explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me after I</font>

514
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,178
got the contempt charge was that

515
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:58,330
apparently I couldn't have appealed the

516
00:22:55,179 --> 00:23:01,539
demand for the ssl keys unless I had

517
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:05,529
drawn the contempt charge if I had

518
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:08,080
simply turned over the keys and tried to

519
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:10,010
appeal it they would have withdrawn the

520
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,600
request

521
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,060
and I would have no standing for an

522
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,139
appeal of course by the time any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

523
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,030
would have worked its way through the

524
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,890
court system they would have had access

525
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:23,389
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my system for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how knows how many days</font>

526
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:27,940
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that i actually got the</font>

527
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:33,580
contempt charge Oh see I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use</font>

528
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,580
standard you know courier new this I

529
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,970
actually contemplated using one of those

530
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:44,630
fonts that closely resembles Egyptian

531
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:47,420
hieroglyphs was decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

532
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,710
little bit too much of a rebellion and

533
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,250
went with one that would just be

534
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:55,580
difficult to OCR you know where the

535
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:57,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">elves kind of run into the f's and the</font>

536
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:01,850
lines were nice and extra skinny<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

537
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,709
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to make sure that when</font>

538
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,590
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through the TSA checkpoint on</font>

539
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,420
my way to DC somebody doesn't disappear

540
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,840
with this envelope for 10 minutes come

541
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,220
back and hand it to me because then

542
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,260
think about the position I'm in I don't

543
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,170
know if my keys have been compromised I

544
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:20,180
don't know if I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shut down so I</font>

545
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,340
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that if I handed</font>

546
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,620
over the keys they'd have to type in the

547
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,540
data by hand figured at the very least

548
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,600
it would give<font color="#E5E5E5"> me time to get back to</font>

549
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:34,460
Dallas and shut down the service but

550
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:42,169
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that it was Al eligible</font>

551
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:44,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight they couldn't read it and it kind</font>

552
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,690
of looks that way my plane kind of

553
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,700
worked so sweet so then so they compel

554
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,900
so then you turned over the the keys at

555
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,690
that point right after<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten thousand</font>

556
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,640
dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> airlines two days I shut down I</font>

557
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,950
dropped<font color="#E5E5E5"> off some external drives and</font>

558
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,260
started dumping all the data off to some

559
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,700
external drives because I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

560
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,010
when I shut down<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

561
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,240
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just confiscate everything and I</font>

562
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,070
figured well what's the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> of trying</font>

563
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,300
to protect my users privacy if they just

564
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:14,210
show up and confiscate all the servers

565
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:16,190
so tuesday<font color="#CCCCCC"> night i showed up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with some</font>

566
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,720
external drive set him up is encrypted

567
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:21,650
and started<font color="#CCCCCC"> thumping all the data off</font>

568
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,979
and wednesday morning I drove over and

569
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,739
dropped<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the keys</font>

570
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:30,559
now there's an interesting story<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

571
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:35,210
apparently the FBI agent found out I had

572
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:37,580
a gun I live in Texas after<font color="#CCCCCC"> all which is</font>

573
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,869
why they demanded when I surrendered the

574
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,978
keys that I do it at a neutral location

575
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:47,389
apparently they told my lawyer they were

576
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:50,239
afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going to shoot him looks</font>

577
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:51,859
like you're messing with me enough that

578
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:54,289
you're afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to shoot you and</font>

579
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:57,228
you're still going forward and demanding

580
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:58,820
this information but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I showed up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

581
00:25:57,229 --> 00:26:00,229
actually surrender the keys it was kind

582
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,820
of funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I had three FBI agents</font>

583
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:06,889
walk out of the Dallas field office all

584
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,299
openly carrying sidearms it's like

585
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:11,988
that's the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd seen those</font>

586
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:16,908
guys openly carry um I guess they were

587
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:19,429
afraid I guess they haven't heard of the

588
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:22,549
court system yeah for resolving disputes

589
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:25,549
but it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my great little</font>

590
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:27,739
anecdotes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know welcome to Texas yeah</font>

591
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,389
so so so speaking in the court system

592
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:31,190
now since then because you'd rather you

593
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:32,928
gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> him the paper they charge you with</font>

594
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,059
contempt based on giving them a printed

595
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:36,919
copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what they asked for and now</font>

596
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,940
you're appealing that and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

597
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:40,700
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier that during this</font>

598
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,109
whole process because it was an issue of

599
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,549
national security I'm assuming that's

600
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:46,129
why they were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop you from</font>

601
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:47,269
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and and now we've</font>

602
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:50,539
talked quite a bit about what's actually

603
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:51,739
going on here so so what's happened in

604
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:53,090
that in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's allowed us to</font>

605
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:57,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and what's going on with</font>

606
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">you right now well in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case and you</font>

607
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,849
know there are multiple issues at play

608
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:03,408
here but at least in this case it was

609
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:07,820
everything was filed in district court

610
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:09,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it was filed under seal so I could</font>

611
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,658
discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with my attorney but only</font>

612
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:14,720
with my attorney under penalty of law

613
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:18,440
and if you go back and you read the

614
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,330
statute basically it's written with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

615
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,879
idea that you're not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to disclose</font>

616
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,658
to the person under investigation that

617
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:28,129
they're under investigation and

618
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:30,799
basically the way the courts have

619
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:32,959
interpreted that is you're not allowed

620
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to disclose to anybody except your</font>

621
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,760
attorney that you've even received one

622
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:41,570
of these requests let alone

623
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,220
any of the details you know surrounding

624
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,760
the request like at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in this case</font>

625
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,770
the demand for the ssl<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys through and</font>

626
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,170
as a result for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months I've</font>

627
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,940
been jumping up on my soapbox saying you

628
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,020
know I understand the need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for keeping</font>

629
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,840
the names of the people under

630
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,550
investigation a secret what I think we

631
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a discussion about publicly</font>

632
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,139
are the methods that our government<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

633
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,630
using to conduct that surveillance and

634
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:09,190
that's what I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working to get</font>

635
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:12,740
unsealed and lo and behold after denying

636
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:15,050
requests from me and my legal team<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

637
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:18,050
get the documents unsealed the judge

638
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:20,000
reversed his decision last week unsealed

639
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,200
most of the documents everything except

640
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,360
the name of the person under

641
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,880
investigation and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the first time</font>

642
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I get to tell you that yes it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

643
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,840
demand for my ssl keys that's what I'm

644
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,710
fighting for and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one more</font>

645
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">question and then I think we're gonna</font>

646
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,030
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up and ask questions so folks</font>

647
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:37,300
have things they'd like to ask ladera

648
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,310
probably now make it way to the mics and

649
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,440
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> solutely the thing that strikes me</font>

650
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most is that what I</font>

651
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,660
understand from<font color="#E5E5E5"> per meeting a lot of</font>

652
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,730
articles in from speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you earlier</font>

653
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,720
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you basically agreed to comply</font>

654
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,280
where he said I will give you the

655
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,950
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the warrants asking for</font>

656
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,149
I'll find a way right you could pull the

657
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,950
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> off specifically that they</font>

658
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed and be able to provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

659
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,720
them that wasn't good enough they wanted

660
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:02,180
the ssl keys what yeah well when I did

661
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,500
finally get a lawyer involved and she

662
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,120
explained to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that this pen</font>

663
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,760
trap-and-trace order<font color="#E5E5E5"> only gives them</font>

664
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,189
permission to collect<font color="#CCCCCC"> meta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

665
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">was like well I'm not prepared to shut</font>

666
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,570
down my business just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect tomato</font>

667
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:16,460
information you know the reason I didn't

668
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,470
record it to a log file was because I

669
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,420
didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to turn it over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VN</font>

670
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:25,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">nsl well as we all know nsl zarnow</font>

671
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,870
unconstitutional they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font>

672
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:30,800
kangaroo court that they go to to get

673
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:33,699
them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a different story so I</font>

674
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:37,490
didn't necessarily have an objection to

675
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:39,740
modifying or in this case adding code to

676
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,480
the daemon that would log out this made

677
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,490
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> information for this one specific</font>

678
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,740
user so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it to turn over and</font>

679
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,710
they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well we</font>

680
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,120
wouldn't be getting it in real time you

681
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,650
mean you wouldn't be able to log into

682
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,959
your device on my network

683
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:57,940
change the collection parameters in real

684
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:01,940
time least<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I'm thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

685
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:04,220
but they insisted on pursuing the ssl

686
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:08,930
keys and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

687
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:13,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">said okay well what if we configure this</font>

688
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:16,220
collection device together I see that

689
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,260
it's configured to only collect and

690
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,620
provide you with the information that

691
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:23,510
you're legally authorized to obtain

692
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,600
excuse me on this one particular user

693
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:28,370
and then I hope 10 characters of the

694
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,949
password you hold<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 characters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

695
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:35,120
password they didn't like that idea

696
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:41,300
either they said give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us our key give us</font>

697
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:44,239
your keys and trust us there's a there's

698
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,500
a great quote when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in DC meeting</font>

699
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,970
with the department of justice attorneys

700
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:53,480
after the hearing I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

701
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:57,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain the sacred trust between a</font>

702
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:00,050
service and its users that as the

703
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:03,620
operator it was my job to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect that</font>

704
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:06,980
trust and that if I allowed them this

00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,689
sort of unrestricted access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their to</font>

violation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sacred trust and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

708
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,550

really think<font color="#E5E5E5"> your users trust you more</font>

710
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:34,330
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> they trust us</font>

711
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:38,720
I said yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> if not then now for sure I</font>

712
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:42,080
know I said yes then<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah i also got into</font>

713
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,380
a long explanation of why it was

714
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,600
important to unseal the request because

715
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,280
you know how do you fight in a

716
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">democratic society to get a law change</font>

717
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:57,740
that nobody knows exists sure and so in

718
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:00,860
its so your appeal against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contempt</font>

719
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">charge is can you talk anybody about the</font>

720
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,159
grounds of what the appeal is on so are

721
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,350
you saying so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't ask for it or</font>

722
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,420
what were what we're working on now and

723
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:11,179
the appeal was actually supposed to be

724
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,800
filed last<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thursday well they unsealed</font>

725
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:16,060
everything on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday which kind of</font>

726
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,080
changed the logistics of our filing

727
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,000
because what was going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in the</font>

728
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,070
public version versus the sealed version

729
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,260
changed so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to be</font>

730
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:27,050
filed tomorrow but what we're appealing

731
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:29,810
are the search<font color="#CCCCCC"> warrant and the subpoena</font>

732
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:33,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> explicitly demanded the ssl keys on</font>

733
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:35,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> grounds that if i win that appeal</font>

734
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,210
then the contempt charge goes away

735
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:43,360
because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was on the basis of me</font>

736
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:47,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">refusing to comply with those orders so</font>

737
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:51,889
effectively what my team is arguing is

738
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,320
that not only does the law not provide

739
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:57,080
the necessary statutory basis for

740
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,909
demanding these keys but that they

741
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,590
violate the Fourth Amendment because

742
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,500
they would provide access to information

743
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,820
that didn't belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact</font>

744
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,760
it would provide access to information

745
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,639
that belonged to every user and required

746
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,160
turning over information that belong to

747
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:17,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business who at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case</font>

748
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:20,810
was an innocent third party so that's

749
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:22,310
what my legal fight is about and you

750
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's it's one of those things where</font>

751
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,470
when I shut down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service I didn't</font>

752
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,879
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what was going to happen I</font>

753
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,470
had a lawyer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was willing to take it</font>

754
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,250
all the way but didn't necessarily have

755
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:35,680
the resources to win it

756
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:39,430
and I threw<font color="#CCCCCC"> up that link asking for</font>

757
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,740
donations and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just overwhelmed I</font>

758
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:45,550
think we raised about 150 thousand

759
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:47,080
dollars in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first few weeks and you</font>

760
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if it weren't for that money I</font>

761
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,980
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we'd have had a chance of</font>

762
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,860
actually winning this fight and it just

763
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:56,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you how important the</font>

764
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,659
ability to speak out is you know there

765
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">was no way as a small business I would</font>

766
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,220
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to raise the resources</font>

767
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,750
needed for this fight if it weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

768
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,230
my ability to tell you guys what was

769
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,760
going on you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are any</font>

770
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,199
certificate authorities in the audience

771
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,360
I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few of the companies are</font>

772
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,699
represented here you may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font>

773
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> legal teams and talk to them</font>

774
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:20,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">about filing friend-of-the-court briefs</font>

775
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:23,350
or a Makai briefs because this issue is

776
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:26,649
going to affect all of us you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font>

777
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:29,980
goes beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL keys because</font>

778
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:33,940
technologies change it goes to whether

779
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:37,240
or not a company a service provider or

780
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:41,950
technology company can have private

781
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:43,989
information intellectual property that

782
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,509
it can be forced to turn over to aid in

783
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:50,109
a government<font color="#CCCCCC"> investigation of somebody</font>

784
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:52,600
using its product or service and if the

785
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:54,820
court says that we basically have to do

786
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,918
everything in our power to assist in

787
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,340
these investigations then we can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

788
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:02,170
secrets we can't keep these private keys

789
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:08,320
secret we can't keep our source code

790
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:11,170
secret we can't be or sorry we could be

791
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,630
forced to modify our products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

792
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,670
services secretly to allow for

793
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,900
government surveillance and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

794
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:21,250
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the letter I put up on my website</font>

795
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:24,070
where I talk about how this issue plays

796
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:26,620
into trust can you trust a company with

797
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:30,100
physical ties to the US that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true</font>

798
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:32,920
precisely what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking about you</font>

799
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,960
know we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who's been</font>

800
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,970
cooperating with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government to</font>

801
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,600
conduct investigations which products

802
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,990
have been changed to weaken their

803
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,700
security to allow for surveillance and

804
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:51,220
those companies couldn't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

805
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:53,379
and what's happening is the rest of the

806
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,790
world not to mention those of us in

807
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">America who are just a little bit</font>

808
00:35:54,790 --> 00:36:01,990
conscious of information security we

809
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:04,720
don't know who to trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore so we</font>

810
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:07,359
just don't trust anyone and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

811
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:12,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a profound effect on American</font>

812
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:18,190
businesses on all of you so leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

813
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:20,410
that any questions there are mics

814
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,859
throughout the hall left and right and

815
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,859
center

816
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,750
we'll go with Louise first as he walked

out burst in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new day thank you very</font>

818
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:52,040
much I don't know you know how else to

819
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:54,950
what else to say yeah doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm I'm</font>

820
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,900

821
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:59,240
being a computer geek who spends most of

822
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:04,700
his time in front<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his computer now</font>

823
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:07,640
your adoration<font color="#CCCCCC"> geeks in shutting down</font>

824
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:10,759
service that doesn't necessarily mean

825
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">they the keys are now gone away and the</font>

00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">evidence that they were seeking have</font>

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,610
gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or it doesn't actually mean</font>

828
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:24,170
that and then perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> a king charger</font>

829
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:26,810
wood destroying evidence it's been

830
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:28,730
falsely reported that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> destroyed all</font>

831
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:30,529
the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers and there was a</font>

832
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:33,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of confusion there I did</font>

833
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:35,090
scrub the servers but I also<font color="#CCCCCC"> preserved</font>

834
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,620
the data on encrypted drives because

835
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're precisely right if I had</font>

836
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,120
destroyed all of the data I would have

837
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:42,980
faced an obstruction of justice charge

838
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,339
because I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was an ongoing</font>

839
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:49,940
investigation and apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feds</font>

840
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:52,180
love prosecuting guys like me who give

841
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:54,950
them a hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> time either with on</font>

842
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:57,500
obstruction of justice charges or lying

843
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,689
to a federal law<font color="#CCCCCC"> enforcement officer</font>

844
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,490
those are apparently the two big things

845
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:04,010
they like to catch people like me on and

846
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:07,129
so ya know I couldn't destroy the data I

847
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:08,690
still have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on encrypted disks and may</font>

848
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:15,800
or may not have been forced<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn some</font>

849
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:18,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it over oh one other thing they did</font>

850
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,290
have the tap in place before I shut down

851
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they had been recording because i</font>

852
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:26,540
didn't use or didn't have diffie-hellman

853
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:28,069
enabled it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible that once they got</font>

854
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,529
the keys they could have gone back and

855
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:33,230
retroactively Lee decrypted some of the

856
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:35,120
data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they may have recorded all I</font>

857
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:37,880
did by shutting down was prevent them

858
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,339
from using any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information such</font>

859
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,260
as the passwords to log into accounts or

860
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,940
collecting any additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

861
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,830
I guess it's worth noting that

862
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,480
technically at least as far as I know

863
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:51,259
they didn't have the legal authority to

864
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:56,630
record doesn't seem to stop them much

865
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:59,120
but who knows if I if I can give

866
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,550
everyone here a message it would be you

867
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,859
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a community we need to</font>

868
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:07,700
make more of an effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support</font>

869
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:09,830
diffie-hellman because it would at least

870
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,589
limit the damage in situations like this

871
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:14,870
they would limit their ability to

872
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:17,300
decrypt SSL connections as a third party

873
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:19,549
observer and it would mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

874
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,310

875
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:25,460
some future date they couldn't retro

876
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:27,410
actively go back and decrypt information

877
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,390
they would effectively force them to do

878
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:31,220
a man in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle which at least in my</font>

879
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,569

882
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,980
Mountain I think one of the most

883
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:47,149
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you said was</font>

884
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:49,190
that they were sure of the room moral

885
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,450
rectitude essentially I think that's a

886
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,690
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for folks to</font>

887
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:55,850
understand that many times when you deal

especially federal law enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

889
00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:01,040
first thing you try to do is explain the

890
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:04,040
situation and from personal experience

891
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,480
they understand the situation then the

892
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,270
days when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with people who</font>

ethical impacts of this hour long since

895
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:17,930
over as you said they sincerely<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

896
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,490
they are acting in the moral best

897
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,740
interest of everyone they sincerely

898
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:23,779
believe that the majority of people

899
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:27,049
except for a tiny<font color="#E5E5E5"> fraction of which I</font>

900
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:30,050
think we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> are trust them and they are</font>

901
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:32,150
they're offended beyond all measure if

902
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:36,800
you say things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like why should I trust</font>

903
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:39,770
you so how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah absolutely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right they</font>

904
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,980
would get offended they got offended by

905
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,590
me you know questioning whether or not I

906
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,360
could trust them<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this information</font>

907
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:49,880
and I really think at least in this case

908
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,220
the Department of Justice lawyers didn't

909
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,290
know the ramifications of what they were

910
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,029
trying to do they were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being told</font>

911
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,500
by the FBI we need this

912
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,810
nation would you please go get it from

913
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:03,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">us but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're right</font>

914
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:05,120
the FBI agents involved knew exactly how

915
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,880
sensitive this information was and

916
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,040
precisely what they were demanding right

917
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,980
so i think that underscores the

918
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:15,620
importance for technical folks of

919
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:18,170
attorneys of legal counseling your first

920
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:20,390
action should always be to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

921
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:24,260
legal counsel our first inclination is

922
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:26,299
engineers is always to explain you know

923
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,400
we have a duty<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our customers to</font>

924
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,980
protect their data it's either it's both

925
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,350
a moral duty and a contractual duty the

926
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:36,830
first thing you should do is call your

927
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:39,950
attorney before you try to explain this

928
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:42,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">might my two cents yeah and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if your</font>

929
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,850
company big enough to have an attorney

930
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,910
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> retainer you should definitely call</font>

931
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:50,750
him as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company of course I</font>

932
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:52,339
did not I guess I'm just lucky I had a

933
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,780
degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> in political science and that</font>

934
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,900
kept me<font color="#E5E5E5"> from saying anything that</font>

935
00:41:53,780 --> 00:42:03,560
totally get by me and hot water thank

936
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:08,390
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your efforts thank you right</font>

937
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:10,000
side of the room pregnancy um my name

938
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:17,240
acquaintance from my<font color="#CCCCCC"> might networks I'm</font>

939
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:18,590
curious I see ties in this too not

940
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,540
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly but along the same</font>

941
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">along the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line as a sort of effort</font>

942
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,250
to what the first discussion of this

943
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">conference is about the Garcia NSA</font>

944
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:31,370
surveillance and into a more historic

945
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,110
trend of the government trying to

946
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:40,520
effectively make secure cryptography

947
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:41,930
illegal it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there that</font>

948
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,340
then being able to contend through the

949
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:46,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">courts that they have authorization to</font>

950
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,380
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access not simply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the specific</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but to your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information generally in</font>

your master<font color="#E5E5E5"> data to which would allow</font>

954
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:58,220
them to not only monitor your existing

might have signed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say she is</font>

957
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:09,110
significant push in that direction by by

00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:10,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> federal government yeah why was he</font>

959
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:12,920
do you see other other ramifications

960
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,390
other implications that I've missed ya

961
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,370
with what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,779
Clipper Chip debate you know for those

00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:20,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">of us who are old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not we should have these chips that</font>

966
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,810
could do cryptography but were weakened

967
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:29,420
such that you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government would</font>

00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:32,930
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys to decrypt the data well</font>

969
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:35,750

973
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:47,180
result the government lost well what

974
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,370
we're learning is that they didn't give

975
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:53,450
up that what they've been doing since

976
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:56,150
then and certainly since 911 is using

977
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:58,490
the courts to effectively accomplish the

978
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:00,140
same goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> only they've been doing it in</font>

979
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,330
secret because if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it in</font>

980
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,700
secret nobody has an<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to</font>

981
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:06,620
object nobody has an opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

982
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,870
speak out against it and that's

983
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,370
precisely<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's happening is there</font>

984
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:14,930
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going along and they're</font>

985
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:18,290
weakening standards demanding companies

986
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:20,060
change their products demanding SSL keys

987
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:22,610
from companies like mine so they can

988
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:24,500
monitor information that goes over the

989
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:26,780
wire and they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all in secret</font>

990
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,520
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving the public the</font>

opportunity to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> out against the</font>

992
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,960
practice and more importantly

993
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,520
we learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the NSA that if they're</font>

994
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:39,420
told no it doesn't matter they do it

995
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:41,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway what great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Danny on the right oh</font>

996
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,690
great then<font color="#E5E5E5"> be with that connects I'm</font>

997
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,250
curious is this the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time a lot of</font>

1013
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,349
that's really important here the

1016
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:42,940
and the current round of attacks on

1017
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,410
cryptography and let's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know make</font>

network are primarily social but there

1020
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:54,490
is a technical component to this that we

1021
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:55,540
all can do something about so you know

1022
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,549
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do something about the social</font>

1023
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,750
stuff too but I don't know what I flow

1024
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,570
of politics to recommend what to do

1025
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:03,070
there but in the technical area we have

1026
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:05,230
the opportunity to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that we're</font>

00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:07,089
implementing algorithms that are that

1028
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:09,550
have perfect forward security right so

1029
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:11,440
so if for instance we all use

1030
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:13,240
diffie-hellman exchanges on these things

1031
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,400
yes we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a little bit of</font>

1032
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,740
latency and we put up with some

1033
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,359
additional overhead and so on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,760
have a look at what are our security

00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,609
these kind of attacks if they happen

1045
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:44,799
we're going to be incredibly rare and it

1046
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:46,470
turns out now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

1047
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,330
ubiquitous and so we need to reevaluate

1048
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:51,189
the security policies that we have now

1049
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:53,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that that's been my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> message for the</font>

1050
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:55,540
last week at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least when talking to a</font>

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,029

1052
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,590
my knowledge there's only one company on

1053
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:02,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet right now that even</font>

1054
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:04,570
supports on a large scale diffie-hellman

1055
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,420
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is most browsers aren't</font>

1057
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,770
needs to happen on both sides we need to

1058
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,870
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modify the</font>

1059
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:15,759
configurations and our servers so that

1060
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:19,480
they offer support for diffie-hellman

1061
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,040
and hopefully prefer it and people who

1062
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,310
are working on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client side need to</font>

1063
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:27,279
do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know at least in my</font>

1064
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:28,720
case I have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on pretty good authority</font>

1065
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,430
they probably would have done a

<font color="#CCCCCC">man-in-the-middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I had enabled</font>

1067
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:35,770
diffie-hellman but there was the

1068
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,860
secondary aspect of even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did enable</font>

1069
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,780
it most of the people connecting to my

1070
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,460
system wouldn't have taken advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1071
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:46,830
it so it wouldn't have made much of a

00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:49,660
difference last question in the middle

1073
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:52,750
very quick commenter than a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

the brain in<font color="#CCCCCC"> rostock utility course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:59,950
six guys but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reinforce what</font>

1077
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:01,810
you said before about not having an

other folks in this room that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are also</font>

1080

small companies like us it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1081
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:08,980
hard you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily even have to</font>

1082
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:11,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone on retainer but have a</font>

1083
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,180
relationship with an attorney that you

can call and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Flynn something like that</font>

1085

<font color="#E5E5E5">have one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know check around locally</font>

1087
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,680
almost every city has somebody and at

1088
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,690
least the first thing they can do is

1089
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,080
tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shut up</font>

1090
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,790
a half yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually did have several</font>

1091
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,650
attorneys that I had relationships with

1092
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:31,860
in Dallas but of course none of them

1093
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:33,930
were specialists in this area of law and

1094
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:36,870
none<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them could represent me in a</font>

1095
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:38,879
courtroom in Alexandria you know so I

1096
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:43,109
reached out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the eff that was my first</font>

1097
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,000
reaction and unfortunately at least I

1098
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:47,430
suspect that they couldn't have helped

1099
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,750
me in this particular case because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1100
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,490
what could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a conflict of</font>

1101
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:59,580
interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you can only sue the</font>

1102
00:48:50,490 --> 00:49:01,919
government on so many issues at once so

1103
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:04,410
I've decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1104
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,080
any money left over in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Defense Fund</font>

1105
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:08,790
when it's over is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set it</font>

1106
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">up as a fun that hopefully the next</font>

1107
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:13,800
small company can use to at least

1108
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:16,440
provide for some look you know some

1109
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,090
legal support for a small company like

1110
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,530
you're somebody that they can call and

1111
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,030
know that they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get a</font>

1112
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:23,760
bill for ten thousand dollars just for

1113
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:25,800
asking a question and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then my</font>

1114
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,780
actual logical question that does the

1115
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,490
ordeal that you went through<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there at</font>

1116
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:33,180
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> some little bit of silver lining</font>

1117
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:35,520
here that says that that if they're

1118
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,080
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> these methods to get the to the</font>

1119
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,300
data does that mean at least as

1120
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:42,660
engineers we've done a good job of a

1121
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,280
trick creating truly secure methods of

1122
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:48,660
communication and storage that they

1123
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:51,030
can't easily great it does say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

1124
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:54,720
certain extent if you've been studying

1125
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:56,730
the crypto debates very closely I think

1126
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,000
most of us believe the cryptographic

1127
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:01,920
primitives are secure what they've

1128
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,370
really been going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after are the</font>

1129
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,700
implementations the periphery the random

00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:11,609
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> generators they've been finding</font>

1131
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:13,529
ways of collecting the keys like for

1132
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:15,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">example picking them up when somebody</font>

1133
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:18,480
emails them to themselves and they go

don't know if anybody's done that but

1138
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:29,070
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a number of ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the</font>

1139
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,080
keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my case I was lucky</font>

1140
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:33,750
enough that I had enough understanding

1141
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,660
of information security not to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1142
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:39,240
myself vulnerable

1143
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:41,759
how much we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually trust hardware</font>

1144
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,740
it's hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a rumor going</font>

1145
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,900
around that when Snowden arrived in

1146
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:48,080
Russia the<font color="#E5E5E5"> KGB tossed out all their</font>

1147
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,130
computers and started using typewriters

1148
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,720
because they didn't trust the random

1149
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:55,530
number generators and their Intel chips

1150
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,330
anymore it's hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say I guess you</font>

1151
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:00,120
know I was a cheap bastard and i bought

1152
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:02,819
old servers off ebay with older Pentium

1153
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:05,100
chips and<font color="#E5E5E5"> holders</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> e on chips so you know</font>

1154
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,380
it could be that they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> after me to</font>

1155
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:11,220
get the keys because you know i'm not

1156
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:13,620
using any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their flawed stuff but that</font>

1157
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:18,029
that's the problem is we don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1158
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:20,520
don't know what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust at least in</font>

1159
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:23,930
this case it seems like they needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1160
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:26,310
know my RSA key in order to break it

1161
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:29,970
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to say that they might not have</font>

1162
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:33,600
been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to brute force at a key of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

1163
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:34,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">48 bits you know in three months but</font>

1164
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:42,420
they didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait three months to</font>

1165
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:45,540
do it thank you I'd is there anybody

1168
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:53,450
certificates that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> issued associated</font>

1169
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:57,319
with those private keys yesterday

1170
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:57,319

godaddy could find out you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what the</font>

1173
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:07,020
back story was on that well let me know

1174
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,610

1175
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,220
but the problem with revoking the keys

1176
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:12,570
within the 60-day window was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1177
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:21,149
