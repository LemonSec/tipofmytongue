1
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:17,539
all right next up we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

2
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:19,430
lightning talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff Houston is here to</font>

3
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:22,180
talk to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Facebook first the</font>

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:31,238
Great Firewall of China Jeff in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room</font>

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:31,238
here he comes run run like lightning

6
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,790
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said this will take about three</font>

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,669
minutes so I heard on Monday<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so did</font>

8
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:56,190
you these scary stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> about just how</font>

9
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,350
good these folk are at spying and doing

10
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,599
various nefarious things on the network

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">and how wonderful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they'd</font>

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,479
managed to hack into hack into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox</font>

13
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,690
and tapped or and so on but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font>

14
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,020
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is government work</font>

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,240
and you know normally a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good day in</font>

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,060
government is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-intentioned in</font>

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,589
competence and a bad day gets malicious

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,920
in competence but it's still kind of

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,369
just in competence so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> China for</font>

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:30,570
an AP Nick meeting in August and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

21
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:34,110
probably aware normally within China

22
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook is not functional they just</font>

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so the directive comes out</font>

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,880
from government<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook mustn't work so</font>

25
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,369
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they make it not work so if</font>

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,229
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside China tunneled out or</font>

27
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,630
anything else and you basically do a dig

28
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,960
for facebook com what you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

29
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:59,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">left is what happens you dig and you get</font>

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:02,630
69 171 229 25 run if you're inside China

31
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:05,520
you hit one dot one dot one dot one and

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:09,060
you know like this afternoon will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,829
heard about IP reputation if there's an

34
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,770
IP address that has an amazing

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:18,810
reputation it's one dot one dot one dot

36
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:22,110
one fascinating so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just figure out</font>

37
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,600
who owns these two IP addresses well if

38
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,930
I do a who is on 69 whatever I come up

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">with facebook but when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a who is on</font>

40
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,950
one dot one dot one dot one I come up

41
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,200
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I'm like it's really nice to</font>

42
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,640
sort of be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook in China but you</font>

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,079
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a little bit weird so okay</font>

44
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,299
let's forget about the outside and let's

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">just focus on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one address inside</font>

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,400
China one dot one dot wonder one so I'm

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,109
going to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and connect to Facebook you</font>

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,590
know type it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bar and I get back</font>

49
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:58,540
one dot one dot one dot one right so are

50
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:02,780
they black hauling<font color="#E5E5E5"> that address</font>

51
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,900
hmm so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at this and let's</font>

52
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">just look at a traceroute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to one dot one</font>

53
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,019
dot one dot one you can try it yourself

54
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:17,689
right now if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you see</font>

55
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:21,349
is it will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an address both inside</font>

56
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:23,510
and outside and right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in this room</font>

57
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:29,268
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address that it should go to is</font>

58
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:39,379
sixty five to ten 126 not 78 right who's

59
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:40,819
that google this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is getting weird so the</font>

60
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:43,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">next question you should be asking is</font>

61
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,768
why is one dot one dot one dot one being

62
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,709
routed right into<font color="#E5E5E5"> google well there is</font>

63
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:52,370
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer because i wanted it so and</font>

64
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:55,669
that's the letter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of authority so this</font>

65
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">is now getting even weirder because i'm</font>

66
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:01,189
running a dark net traffic collector at

67
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,790
11 11 in California with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google thank</font>

68
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:07,009
you google this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrific so here's</font>

69
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:11,780
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the traffic that we see coming</font>

70
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:17,690
in to that dark net collector it's all

71
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:19,789
incoming sins from<font color="#CCCCCC"> China so you know</font>

72
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,580
inside all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area of who's max you</font>

73
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:24,380
spying on who and why I still<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

74
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,780
understand why whenever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

75
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,880
to Facebook in China you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get sent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

76
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,599
google and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching that's pretty</font>

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">bizarre but it gets stranger because</font>

78
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:38,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes when you ask that question and</font>

79
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:40,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">I asked MDOT route service net in China</font>

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,259
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just tell you the NS servers</font>

81
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:45,620
know it gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the real answer and</font>

82
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:51,880
really in China despite all their

83
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,880
efforts Facebook is everywhere thank you

84
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,200
thanks Jeff next up<font color="#CCCCCC"> Scott white with</font>

85
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:14,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google talking about the SNMP and what</font>

86
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:17,940
he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see next how cool all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

87
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's always hard to follow Jeff um and I</font>

88
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,010
don't know if Nathan Hickson's in the

89
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,159
room<font color="#CCCCCC"> but he's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one who helped Jeff</font>

90
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,710
out with that so good job Nathan<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

91
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,150
lightning talk and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get we want to</font>

92
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,530
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> done so we can do better than SNMP</font>

93
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook gave a very very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

94
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,539
today I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank them for that</font>

95
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,150
they unwittingly helped to move forward

96
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,490
my thesis here though which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically</font>

97
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,109
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have two ways to get data out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

98
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,510
networks right now and onto our networks

99
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,680
which is SNMP and CLI scraping in fact

100
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">they reminded me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of one I completely</font>

101
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">forgot bow which is syslog one of the</font>

102
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,520
reasons I forgot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this log is it's</font>

103
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,320
it's in my opinion it's actually even

104
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,599
less possible than most things the

105
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,780
syslog was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of designed for human</font>

106
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,430
consumption and you know every every

107
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,289
implementation spits out different

108
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,260
syslog so you have to take it to the

109
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,300
next level to actually parse you know

110
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">information to make that programmatic in</font>

111
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,120
some way so kudos<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them for doing that</font>

112
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,880
as well you know s is a lie it's not

113
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,010
simple it's impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use for large</font>

114
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">data set retrieval we're performance</font>

115
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:25,620
bound it's got these you know inverted

116
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,080
column row semantics the data structures

117
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,450
that you know mean that you end up

118
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,909
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to force the OS to do all kinds</font>

119
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,650
of crazy backflips to get it to be able

120
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to populate an answer before it gives it</font>

121
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you</font>

122
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,919
and CLI scraping I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean do we</font>

123
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,419
even need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this so what do</font>

124
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,128
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need we need to retrieve large data</font>

125
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,198
<font color="#E5E5E5">sets like I said we need high resolution</font>

126
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:51,759
without hammering the CPU remember we

127
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,270
need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data off the boxes as</font>

128
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,620
much data as we can as quick as we can

129
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,659
what would we like well we would like

130
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,789
money fame power etc but what we what we

131
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:04,479
would like in this context is flexible

132
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:05,710
framework so so I think what I see what

133
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,050
i would suggest here is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> data-driven</font>

134
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,299
model a data model driven approach where

135
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,930
I query a network node it has

136
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,699
implemented some data model I it sends

137
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,879
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I can inspect that I</font>

138
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:20,110
can select you know via some kind of

139
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,819
filtering capability I could select

140
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,500
things I like and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said subscribe</font>

141
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:27,370
to them with some metadata that says how

142
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,860
often push pull the you know format

143
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,719
agnostic I mean maybe I want Jason maybe

144
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody else wants XML maybe somebody</font>

145
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:37,240
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants asn1 because they want this</font>

146
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,849
to you know easily transition out of

147
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,759
their existing SNMP maybe somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font>

148
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:44,409
a proc net because you know their

149
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,789
servers are already spitting out

150
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,680
information that format and they want to

151
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">unify things I think there's no reason</font>

152
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,300
why we couldn't make this extensible to

153
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:56,650
all those needs transport options I

154
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:58,509
think also should be negotiable I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

155
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,520
one quick example would be interface

156
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:01,960
data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people use</font>

157
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,219
interface they did for billing they're

158
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,169
not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want to lose that</font>

159
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:08,050
data other people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to use</font>

160
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:09,580
interface data for novel things like you

161
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time traffic engineering and</font>

162
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,419
in the time value of the data is lost

163
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,000
once the packets has to be transmitted

164
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:18,068
so maybe I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do UDP for this and</font>

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,310
they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do tcp that we should we</font>

166
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:24,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">should allow that flexibility</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamps</font>

167
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,169
you know drives me crazy so you know i'm

168
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,699
not talking about necessarily time

169
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,198
series format where every single piece

170
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,969
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data has a diet timestamp attached</font>

171
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,529
but at least having a time stamp

172
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,870
associated with every other tables

173
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,909
whatever so that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that you</font>

174
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,269
know when the data was collected you

175
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:42,419
know authoritative<font color="#E5E5E5"> lee oh and i don't</font>

176
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:44,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to go back pub sub so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

177
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,360
underlying<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the assumption that</font>

178
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,100
we have some kind of pub sub

179
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,449
infrastructure as many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

180
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,640
it's been implemented there's there's

181
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:53,079
lots of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> solutions for that but</font>

182
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,300
the advantage there is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to</font>

183
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,430
reinvent those things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can push a</font>

184
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,990
lot of the complexity reliability that

185
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,810
sort of thing out of this protocol where

186
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,660
it shouldn't live in the first place I

187
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,369
got ahead of myself there so basically

188
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,199
yeah we the whole point of this is to

189
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,490
you know I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get data off the box</font>

190
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,340
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what to do that I</font>

191
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,870
don't want this you know switch this top

192
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,610
Iraq switch to have to do any kind of

193
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,010
thinking at all any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of computation</font>

194
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,200
I just wanted to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me what it what it</font>

195
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,800
can tell me and then I subscribe to it

196
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,940
and then it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts reporting along</font>

197
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,709
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that though I mean we can we can</font>

198
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,200
get fancier right we can do asynchronous

199
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,060
we can do synchronous you know we can

200
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,440
have the thing set up so that i can set

201
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,609
some thresholds potentially an it will

202
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,570
report to me if it has that capability

203
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:39,760
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thresholds broken or just some</font>

204
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,040
event like a link down or something you

205
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">know or the more generic subscriptions</font>

206
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,849
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data you know i say i</font>

207
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,140
want this data every five minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

208
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,700
this date every five seconds I want this

209
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,699
data every five days and it just sets it

210
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,650
up streaming one-offs you know I maybe

211
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,080
maybe I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a rib dump maybe I</font>

212
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:58,000
want to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a rib stream you</font>

213
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,670
know maybe I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use B and P and I</font>

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,080
can set that up and then push and pull

215
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,000
should be able to do all this stuff with

216
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the single framework I think with</font>

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,130
today's technology so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BMP I</font>

218
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,630
don't see any reason why we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

219
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,700
reinvent protocols to do this as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

220
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,590
mean one thing we could do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

221
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,480
that's cool with this is we could we

222
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,430
could as part of the capability to go

223
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,110
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> shouldn't discover oh you do s</font>

224
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,030
flow oh well I would actually like to

225
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,500
set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> these s flow feeds for me and so</font>

226
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,180
now I have a way to dynamically set up

227
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,470
as flow which I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

228
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,270
capability<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing right now right now</font>

229
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,050
I have to do it be a configuration and

230
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:35,550
it's very static you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

231
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,510
one size shoe fits all type thing and

232
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,969
just to reiterate the point I don't

233
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have to invent much I mean you</font>

234
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,300
know if we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go with the ITF and</font>

235
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,950
this is what I'm interested in right now

236
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,900
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you know net comp with some nice</font>

237
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,640
extensions would be very useful we have

238
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the yang model for for data models</font>

239
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,449
already kind of well understood as I

240
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,190
mentioned we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have plenty of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pub/sub</font>

241
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,720
implementations we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already understand</font>

242
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,310
command and control what we really want

243
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do here is solve that last piece</font>

244
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,170
where you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run pop it</font>

245
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,469
on everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever</font>

246
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,079
is chef and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve this this</font>

247
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,760
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> last piece where I can get the day</font>

248
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,860
on and off the routers just as easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

249
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,050
get them on and off my servers and and

250
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,090
so in the end I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the best place for</font>

251
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,780
us to live hopefully is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i2s working</font>

252
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:21,450
group so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to author a co-author</font>

253
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,670
of a use case draft is the starting

254
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,780
point to hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive a information</font>

255
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,209
model and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then actually get some</font>

256
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:34,680
implementations going that's it thank

257
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:36,660
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and that's a wrap for today</font>

258
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">beer and gear is kicking off in the</font>

259
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,939
kamati rooms and the social post beer

260
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,680
and gear is actually moving from the

patio saves you at least 20 seconds of

263
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:53,220
walking outside the beer and gear please

264
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:54,449
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wisely thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone and don't</font>
