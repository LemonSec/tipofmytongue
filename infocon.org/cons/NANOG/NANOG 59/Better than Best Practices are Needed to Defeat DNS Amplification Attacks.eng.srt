1
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:19,480
next up we have Ralph Weber

2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,480
of nominal Ralph

3
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so DNS seems to be a good tool for</font>

4
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,810
any sort of attacker that's what now is

5
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,480
the second talk of kind of the abuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

6
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:55,500
DNS for something and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,239
about DNS amplification attacks and this

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,200
is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a new thing I mean we've</font>

9
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:04,620
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> some talks that they're not 56 and</font>

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,720
there were some work done on how we

11
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,090
could offend from these mainly from

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,590
authoritative servers and resource

13
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,369
rate-limiting has been implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,070
by pretty much most of the major

15
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:21,450
software vendors our version came out

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:27,300
last week so that's sort of a done deal

17
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:29,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think from speaking to people here</font>

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,810
that the large attacks on the

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,369
authoritative while there are still

20
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,180
attacks they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not to that</font>

21
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:38,009
level that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have been so the DNS</font>

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,180
amplification was used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest</font>

23
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:45,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">30 years at all and the open resolvers</font>

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,190
have been a problem and providers

25
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,650
worldwide see attacks on these resolvers

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,408
so just a quick introduction on how it

27
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,610
works basically the attack relies on the

28
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:59,330
fact that you can spoof the IP address

29
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:02,850
you use UDP because there is no kind of

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,820
whatever connection setup so you don't

31
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,530
care and you have a small packet and

32
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,730
then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> generates a large answer and</font>

33
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,709
most of the stuff that people were using

34
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and are still using our any curious</font>

35
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is give me every record said that</font>

36
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,500
you have for that name and especially at

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:28,230
kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top of the zone these are</font>

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:31,500
usually large records oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when</font>

39
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,420
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that how it looks if you are</font>

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,760
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with a dick you basically</font>

41
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,350
that case I'll used is York<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,260
that's one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been</font>

43
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:43,079
used and you receive something like 3k

44
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,420
records for security that is 50 bite or

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,410
something like that and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> then do</font>

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mass for that you can generate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

47
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,760
a relatively low

48
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,940
say if home connection relatively large

49
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,420
amount of traffic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can pretty</font>

50
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,220
much fill up a gig pipe by<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a few</font>

51
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,100
home<font color="#E5E5E5"> connections and a botnet that just</font>

52
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:07,700
requires a couple of well say 20 or 30

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,980
people are actually using destroyers

54
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,790
it's pretty easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and also pretty</font>

55
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,750
cheap too to rent probably and if you

56
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,310
have a few thousands of these

57
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:21,290
connections use these attacks that we

58
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:23,330
saw with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spamhaus and these attacks</font>

59
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:29,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">s that are not new but they are ongoing</font>

60
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:32,420
and they are also changing a bit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

61
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,870
that the initial stuff was mainly

62
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,220
focused on authoritative service and

63
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,530
resource rate-limiting now that it's

64
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,750
deployed by lots of people kind of make

65
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:46,520
that go away because the attacker I mean

66
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:50,450
if I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of simple target</font>

67
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:54,080
I can use I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose the next</font>

68
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">target that is simple to use and some of</font>

69
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,710
the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work is there then not</font>

70
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,450
and shifts the focus from the

71
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:02,180
authoritative to the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve with</font>

72
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,950
and I talked with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of eyes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Pisa</font>

73
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,090
said well we have open<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolvers because</font>

74
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,619
we don't know the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

75
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,810
have you and then they've gotten these

76
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,560
attacks and then they will were a bit

77
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,870
more open to kind of limiting the excess

78
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:21,200
they resolver to only allow them for

79
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:24,530
their customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so these then led to</font>

80
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,990
eyes peas with having the resolvers

81
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,549
locked down their own customers so

82
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,950
everything was good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were still</font>

83
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:34,100
seeing the attacks so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

84
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,810
happening a lot of the open resolvers we

85
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,910
see out there are actually not open

86
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,470
resolvers at all they have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

87
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,750
to resolve they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> traverse to the</font>

88
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:46,190
root or what have you what they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

89
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:49,670
they simply DNS proxy and that house

90
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:52,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">looks so the attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we see as lots</font>

91
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:57,200
of eyes peas at the moment are utilizing

92
00:04:52,070 --> 00:05:00,349
mostly broken gateways or or wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

93
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">up home gateway boxes or wrong set up</font>

94
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,190
dns servers on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

95
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,659
and they use that by simply spoofing a

96
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,430
pack of the attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> spoof the packet</font>

97
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,740
and then sends that to the home gateway

98
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,340
and home gateway then<font color="#CCCCCC"> prox you said so</font>

99
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,320
it gets the curious puts it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in its IP</font>

100
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,810
address in and sends it to the ISP

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,969
resolvers and the ice peers over it's a

102
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,650
customer of mine I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to answer it so</font>

103
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">answers sends a packet back to the home</font>

104
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,150
gateway<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home gateway says okay I got</font>

105
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,010
this i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send it back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

106
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,650
client which is the victim and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

107
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:36,480
victim then kind of gets overwhelmed

108
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:40,049
with traffic so um how do we figure that

109
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,880
out and said we had kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lots of</font>

110
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,700
reports from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers that had that</font>

111
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem and we then looked at other</font>

112
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,500
stuff and we found the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open resolver</font>

113
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:53,000
project which is a real good slider that

114
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:56,640
keeps track<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things and they</font>

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,470
recently kind of send try to fingerprint

116
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,400
or send the chaos<font color="#E5E5E5"> screwy that identifies</font>

117
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:05,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name server and they well then</font>

118
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,239
produced a report on which software

119
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,729
versions were used and we found out

120
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,550
something like nearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500,000 ventures</font>

121
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,969
resolvers so we sell our software and

122
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,590
it's not cheap and I was a bit surprised

123
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,360
because either<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone's stealing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

124
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,549
software or if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have really sold that</font>

125
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:29,430
much what I'm doing here not lying on a

126
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:31,590
beach in Hawaii I mean so something on

127
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:36,930
must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on so we try to figure out</font>

128
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:38,549
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on and asset customers</font>

129
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">reflect that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the excess so there must be</font>

130
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,570
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so I set up a simple</font>

131
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,359
experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some of those robbers</font>

132
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:48,030
and created a domain that didn't have

133
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,620
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything in it but had one named</font>

134
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">service that I can then actually look at</font>

135
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the traffic coming in so i sent the</font>

136
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,750
unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> curie for an IP that's just an</font>

137
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,950
example there and then i looked at the

138
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic on the name server and found out</font>

139
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,750
well the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm receiving</font>

140
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:09,510
which in that case is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client address</font>

141
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:11,610
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name I p address of the</font>

142
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,560
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> Okla resolver and the reason is</font>

143
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:19,050
is because one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these open proxies</font>

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:22,260
and this was the way help attacker used

145
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,680
it and they also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of switched the</font>

146
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,370
attacks from initially was kind of all

147
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,690
because they were coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

148
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,410
authoritative site on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authority of</font>

149
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:33,540
side the interesting targets are well

150
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:36,150
the people who deploy or may deployed in

151
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,480
a sec and have large recordsets but as

152
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,419
soon as they switch the attacks they

153
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,880
kind of got into other<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses because</font>

154
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:47,789
these names were known to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

155
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,419
attacks so they set up sort of their

156
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,620
special<font color="#E5E5E5"> records and they just did a</font>

157
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,990
creosote they didn't care about the

158
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,820
intersect they just cared about the

159
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,040
amplification and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> also found</font>

160
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,520
there and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all some sort the example</font>

161
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,130
we'll see later there were some people

162
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,960
who might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit problematic</font>

163
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:12,630
understanding of DNS when setting up

164
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,880
records and zones something like even if

165
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,800
kind of MX or a records for mayor

166
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchanges might be a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to have</font>

167
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,550
more than one maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1250 is not a good</font>

168
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:26,580
number to have and we see lots of this

169
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff so and the advantage of this</font>

170
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,909
approach obviously the ice piercers

171
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oliver are great resource they are I</font>

172
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean I ski try to scale their resolver</font>

173
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:39,209
so they can serve their customer base

174
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:41,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they are pretty nifty and pretty can</font>

175
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:46,530
be heavily loaded so it was good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

176
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:50,940
these resources and with that all the

177
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:53,819
kind of stuff we had so far which was RL

178
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,880
and stuff like that didn't help<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

179
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,580
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at something else job can we</font>

180
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,170
defend them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean the obviously the</font>

181
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,540
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way would be to upgrade the home</font>

182
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,729
gateway well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to happen as</font>

183
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,730
well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 38 probably that's going to</font>

184
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:12,720
happen so where you have to find

185
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:15,959
something else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may work and what we</font>

186
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,779
said well we with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> service we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

187
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,689
the ability to basically live look into

188
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:24,450
the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's coming in and do some</font>

189
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:27,060
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyzed on this in nearly real</font>

190
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,940
time so we said well we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that and</font>

191
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,699
can then maybe find out some formality

192
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,580
and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically look what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

193
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:39,030
Curie's of what are people doing that

194
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,310
what other curie types are used and we

195
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:47,189
then basically try to detect this stuff

196
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:49,709
and with that gonna now go from away

197
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:53,430
from the presentation and try to do this

198
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we have this evening can trigger</font>

199
00:09:53,430 --> 00:10:03,079
the mouse<font color="#E5E5E5"> with most things I'm gonna</font>

200
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,079
just expanded a bit

201
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:15,440
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of a server that I've set</font>

202
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,000
up and that has isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> open resolver at</font>

203
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,399
the moment the internet and what I'm

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,420
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try now I'm going to ask it for</font>

205
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:26,600
the top domains that it has been asked

206
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:29,120
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last hour that have a response</font>

207
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:34,819
sighs so where the answer was larger

208
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:36,860
than 1k there we go so if you see top

209
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:40,399
domains IRL winning<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm then we have</font>

210
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">fkfk if a calm I Sea Org still is kind</font>

211
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,319
of active they we have a pointer

212
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:49,310
probably in our progress and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have dot</font>

213
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:55,399
and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at that now to actually</font>

214
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:57,079
see what the names and Kure types of

215
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,509
that world that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font>

216
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:02,479
that's enough what we have K so you see

217
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:05,779
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are still using any just</font>

218
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,139
because you can get as much stuff in

219
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:11,870
there as possible and the PTR probably

220
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,180
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that get left over and if we look</font>

221
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">at what these domains are now I'm just</font>

222
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,839
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try this one</font>

223
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,209
you see it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> around 4,000 fights and</font>

224
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,700
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of this domain was clearly</font>

225
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:32,709
set up only to do an amplification

226
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,870
attack there's nothing else you can do

227
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:37,209
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I mean you might I haven't tried</font>

228
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,820
TCP connecting but there probably won't

229
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:41,260
be anything listening to that and if you

230
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the other domain what was the</font>

231
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,290
top one this one

232
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,949
it's roughly roughly the same so one of

233
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:00,109
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we didn't see here and</font>

234
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:05,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to now probably scroll back</font>

235
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:07,999
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this pointer record also kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

236
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:17,600
brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> me was brought to my attention</font>

237
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:19,970
and we do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's 12 k now</font>

238
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,939
this isn't an issue with most server

239
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:26,119
implementations because the implementers

240
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:29,899
seem to be sensible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and limit the output</font>

241
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:32,089
they give with UDP to around 4k most in

242
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:34,779
the some implementations allow larger

243
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:37,519
packets but most of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't so that</font>

244
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:41,089
will switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp and make the attack</font>

245
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,439
basically not doable anyway but maybe

246
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:49,100
put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pointer record for every possible</font>

247
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:52,549
name that might hit that or might be

248
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:55,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">life at that IP in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS is not a good</font>

249
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:57,829
idea so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12k packets for a particular</font>

250
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:59,868
pointer to me seems just too much and

251
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:01,878
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting domain i saw that</font>

252
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:05,959
actually got me scratching my head a lot

253
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:09,110
was where we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it oh it doesn't</font>

254
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:11,029
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more so okay I'm gonna it</font>

255
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:15,549
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that sample so I'm</font>

256
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:18,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to show it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you so um there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

257
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:22,449
domain called netfirms comment if you'd

258
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:25,369
with something like depth netfirms com

259
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:29,349
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much normal a record not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

260
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:33,769
big thing now if you do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

261
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:35,929
garbage you get 4,000 pipes back and

262
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:37,939
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty much for every garbage</font>

263
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:39,949
for that domain you do and that's while

264
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:41,949
we see this in text because that's

265
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:44,299
probably in this configuration or a

266
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,859
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is wrong I've tried to</font>

267
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:47,329
contact them I haven't got anything back

268
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,459
from them so somebody knows these guys

269
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:51,979
which tells him to do to fix their

270
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,569
servers because anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that you</font>

271
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,669
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> simply get back these four</font>

272
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:58,248
thousand amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ideal because that</font>

273
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:01,189
is exactly at the point where you're

274
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:03,709
still using UDP and not switching<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP so</font>

275
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:04,510
that's and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call these dual use two</font>

276
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:08,530
things because they

277
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:11,890
have a legitimate purpose but well they

278
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:17,410
also have the things an attacker can can

279
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:20,050
use so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go back to the</font>

280
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,680
presentation if I can manage to find my

281
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,680
mouse

282
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that's basically what we've done</font>

283
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:37,829
to detect this stuff and I think the

284
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:41,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">last pages are just so what can we do</font>

285
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:46,769
about this well we have to do some way

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:50,069
of filtering because we don't want to

actually be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannon or the eyes peas</font>

or don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be the cannon do kind</font>

for that customer i'm just going to nine

292
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:06,689
now to basically creamy with a record

293
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">with other records so we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

294
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,519
careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we do there at the</font>

295
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,380
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> still most of the stuff that you</font>

296
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,069
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll guess that will change</font>

297
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:20,579
is filter or put<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate-limiting ziff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

298
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:22,410
can on any but as set this will probably

299
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,930
change in the future because once

300
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,329
attacker detect that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're attacked no</font>

301
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,829
more effective they go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> or they</font>

302
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:32,069
change the attack I mean what we've seen

303
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:35,370
when we work with our customers as soon

304
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:38,399
as you kind of block domain or annex

305
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:41,040
domain the domain they<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

306
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,670
they go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away they might come back with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">neither domain the next day but the</font>

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:50,519
attacker seem to actually also<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor</font>

309
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:53,819
how effective their attacks are and I

310
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,199
mean other stuff has<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aspen's that before</font>

311
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,790
what can we do well we have to maybe do

312
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">a reputation list we have to maybe</font>

313
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:03,529
filter on them and we have to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

314
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:06,240
to I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> truncate we don't see I mean</font>

315
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:09,689
dropping the packet at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP level as</font>

316
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,339
a if you are resolver to end clients is

317
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,829
not as bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> as dropping the packet on the</font>

318
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,649
authoritative server it's still bad so

319
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:21,269
we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> do truncate because these</font>

320
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:24,750
attacks and there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been some word</font>

321
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:27,540
confusion some people describe them as

322
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,009
reflection attacks but the attackers are

323
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,660
not interested in my point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of view in</font>

324
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:32,880
reflection they're interesting

325
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,009
amplification if you sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to say if</font>

326
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,160
given if you give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same traffic</font>

327
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:39,790
back and forth they will go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away they're</font>

328
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,280
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested to actually</font>

329
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:49,180
well if you give them large packet back

330
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:52,480
and one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

331
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:56,079
was a talk on<font color="#E5E5E5"> DN a--</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Zorich to that was</font>

332
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,900
on sunday on kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp so i hope that</font>

333
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,390
if we do that truncating that step

334
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">resolve as will speak tcp and do the</font>

335
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:06,940
right thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know that this has</font>

336
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:09,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">been an issue with some DNS SEC rollouts</font>

337
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:13,990
where we had lots of gateways that

338
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:16,690
didn't understand tcp for dns<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope</font>

339
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,880
that because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns a growler this</font>

340
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,930
has been changed a bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know</font>

341
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">yet so and this is just how we need our</font>

342
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:29,290
server basically block that this is

343
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:31,270
blocking any attacks for a dot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> r at</font>

344
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net oh and the dog attack also is</font>

345
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,980
pretty interesting because while the

346
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:43,800
actual dot with you nothing just going

347
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to back go back here where is no mouse</font>

348
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:52,389
there is so if you do dick dot any it's

349
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,060
1600<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's not that much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

350
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:58,270
keep in mind the actual packet that you

351
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,280
need is just 45 bites so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

352
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,620
smallest possible dns packet that you

353
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,680
can have and that's still a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

354
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">amplification factor so now I need to</font>

355
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,520
find us again

356
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:20,730
yeah and it's all about size so maybe if

357
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:24,240
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find ways in name server software</font>

358
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:28,320
to actually do something or to handle

359
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,050
stuff differently if we receive or have

360
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,330
answers of a certain size then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

361
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">have been able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to automate this I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

362
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:39,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something that we are</font>

363
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:42,740
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> into at the moment but and the</font>

364
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:45,800
thing that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to miscount is</font>

365
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,240
attackers will change when we are

366
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,659
basically doing defenses against these

367
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,720
attacks and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the rest is</font>

368
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:59,600
pretty much XD examples you had these

369
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:02,010
are other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're rude</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

370
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,350
what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should do we should</font>

371
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,170
really try to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate limiting at</font>

372
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:10,409
the moment if we have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on names or</font>

373
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:12,179
name and fqdn or some reputation lists

374
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,910
even kind of sending back<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ex domain</font>

375
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:16,890
if you don't have the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do rate</font>

376
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">limiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it might be a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea if you</font>

377
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,940
but you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do that for names</font>

378
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,190
where you are sure this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

379
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is bad so if it's something you</font>

380
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,420
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to actually send back</font>

381
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,220
an ex domain for hikes your core or

382
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,080
right or net or something like that but

383
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,010
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sure it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that then</font>

384
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:37,020
maybe sending back any cement if your

385
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:39,750
resolve where only the supports that

386
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,070
might be good idea and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

387
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,230
should really rate limiting based on

388
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,928
ostracize and that's something that we

389
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,420
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking into and maybe I can talk to</font>

390
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">you about that later or in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of</font>

391
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">years so that was all I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

392
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,320
questions

Karen<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluebird noir it's not so I</font>

394
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:20,379
escalation sides we know that was also

395
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:24,239
problem solvers and another way of doing

396
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:27,070
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we're going to fix that all</font>

397
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:30,609
knowing getting around with ourselves at

398
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:32,499
the stand all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had for years of the</font>

day results of the problems of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:40,119
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he and the fact that we can</font>

401
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:43,979
still find ESL hours today that our open

402

405
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:57,980
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as a hazard like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flyer and</font>

406
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:03,530
start

407
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:06,260
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fully agree with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you but the thing</font>

408
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,389
is you need something like 30k packets

409
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,830
to actually fill up a pig and most

410
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,740
people haven't connected their dns

411
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,299
server yet with 10 gig so even kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

412
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,450
as a matter of self-defense you have to

413
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:19,160
do something because a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of of</font>

414
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,500
attackers could easily kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of make your</font>

415
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,030
DNS tree around available so I mean

416
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,360
while I'll agree we have to do something

417
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the root cause I think there's no</font>

418
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:33,110
way on getting around kind of basically

419
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:50,860
measurements to defend against his

420
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:50,860
attack now if the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing with</font>

421
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ideal would be truncate but not all</font>

422
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,720
software currently that's out there

423
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:02,799
supports setting truncate on an answer

424
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:07,370
if it's kind of a rate-limiting so

425
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:09,290
that's purely a sort of stopgap measure

426
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,909
if you are one hundred percent sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

427
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:14,080
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are seeing here is not a</font>

428
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">legitimate kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cure that's not a</font>

429
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,040
it's not that I'm saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should</font>

430
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,900
ask for an extra minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have to</font>

431
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,780
defend the attack if the attack

432
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,750
basically brings my name server to a

433
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:30,720
grinding halt resolve is over

434
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:33,330
you're saying is I have a hundred

435
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent certainty that this is not a</font>

436
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:43,740
real query I never had a sense or

437
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:54,360
anything the as I then just go answer it

438
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:56,100
I mean if you know what for for the

439
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,740
reserve of this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the cache</font>

440
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,320
poisoning but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a problem it's my</font>

441
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:10,830
customer that is answer is also asking a

442
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:15,169
question so weary or<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can answer you</font>

443
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:26,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an answer it that actual names of</font>

444
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:29,490
all the sale yes sir ok sir Phil I mean

445
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,740
I said the stuff that you saw there

446
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:43,200
would drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff so we also tried</font>

447
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:52,620
that and did work yeah that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

448
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:56,550
suggesting yeah i mean that that wasn't

449
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:58,350
suggesting i was making the best way to

450
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:00,300
defend this against attack if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

451
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,639
sure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the attack and sent back</font>

452
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">tc1 and if somebody behind that really</font>

453
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,240
once that answer it will try with tcp

454
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,240
and get the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i told you we're</font>

455
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,360
right

456
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:19,250
the question about being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> filter</font>

457
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,240
the network level<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

458
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:25,429
where residential open resolvers

459
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:29,330
droppings are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably put filters</font>

460
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:32,419
closer to them on inbound traffic on

461
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:37,010
port 53 as a destination that will

462
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:40,330
prevent any of the old result<font color="#E5E5E5"> or proxies</font>

463
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:44,870
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or seeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those patterns and</font>

464
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:47,360
solving<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues change well but that</font>

465
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:54,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">would mean that my customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't run</font>

466
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:56,389
name servers or<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes sorry he run</font>

467
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:59,590
resolvers how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

468
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:03,020
distinction are you you're certain

469
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:06,678
answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that are coming at you apart</font>

470
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:11,090
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inside plus there's an old</font>

471
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:13,820
resolver or as a reserve yeah but I said

472
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,408
how do you make the distinction I mean

473
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,668
what filter list should I should I look

474
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:18,669
basically the RT<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit is set</font>

475
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:27,580
servers you may pass out that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

476
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:30,010
don't separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> those up on some weight</font>

477
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:33,159
on your constructor then you can't fight

478
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:35,680
that home<font color="#E5E5E5"> though guessing agree but if</font>

479
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:39,670
it's not reasonable to not trying

480
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:41,590
they're not but yeah but you have to I

481
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean acid separating about is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue</font>

482
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:48,129
but then you have to probably change all

483
00:25:45,520 --> 00:26:00,070
your acceptable use policy what happens

484
00:25:48,130 --> 00:26:01,870
right the racers over but dns tries over

485
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,280
UDP first and if it doesn't get an

486
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,219
answer back it won't you try over<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font>

487
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,080
that's to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the TC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it is I</font>

488
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:13,240
mean that has been to suggest it but I

489
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:17,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that if people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do that</font>

490
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:20,160
they have to do some precise kind of

491
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:24,400
looking into the issue on kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

492
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:31,020
essays or whatever use policies before

493
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:34,020
they do that so were it possible Paul's

494
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,020
yeah

495
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,450
your questions

496
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,960
you
