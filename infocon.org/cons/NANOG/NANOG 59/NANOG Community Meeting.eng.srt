23
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:10,179

24
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,590
money my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joe ably I don't really</font>

25
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">have anything to say about myself I</font>

26
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,270
thought I'd point out that I feel like

27
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,670
my career certainly in North America

28
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,230
started at nanog and nanog is really

29
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,099
important and I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great that</font>

30
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,000
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> flourished the way it has I think</font>

31
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:27,790
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> many things that could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be done</font>

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make it better but also continuing</font>

33
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,500
the way it is is important too so now

34
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,869
log is a really important thing and you

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,580
should vote and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's less</font>

36
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,090
important who you vote for to be honest

37
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:43,060
then you vote and you invest yourself in

38
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,250
nanog moving forward so that's kind of

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,220
an honest statement from me it's a vote

40
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,130
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor of the nanog party please go</font>

41
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:55,330
vote and I've saved a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> and feel</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">didn't start with nanog it certainly</font>

51
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,480
took a step upwards as a young engineer

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,679
I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> attending these meetings and I</font>

53
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:42,170
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've learned a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot both from</font>

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,720
the tutorials the content and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

55
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,579
sessions and the relationships that I

56
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,190
built over the years here it's become

57
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,740
important part of my life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in that</font>

58
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,109
vein I decided to run to try and

59
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,690
hopefully give something back some of

60
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that concern me or with some</font>

61
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,420
of the transitions that the

62
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,109
organization's gone through in the last

63
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,850
couple of years is really I think you

64
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,060
know the program committee has done a

65
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">great job I worry about relevance</font>

66
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,170
relevance overall there's a lot of

67
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,459
things happening that affect our our

68
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:18,140
jobs in our livelihoods as operators and

69
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:21,530
hopefully with some guidance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

70
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,630
leadership may not can at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> position</font>

71
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,419
itself to help influence some of that

72
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,980
and also prepare the next generation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,960
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are going to be overseeing</font>

74
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,930
what we've built what we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

75
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:42,080
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so with that I'd ask for your</font>

two minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,530
breeze through the heartfelt campaign

84
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,140
speech that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wrote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what you'll have</font>

85
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">to settle for instead is me standing up</font>

86
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,840
here telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I care about nanog and</font>

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,950
ultimately why I bother and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

88
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">our monic that I chose the word bothered</font>

89
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,400
because the genesis of the speech<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

90
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,229
wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually conversation I had at</font>

91
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,469
which somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> asks me why whatever</font>

92
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:21,539
bother run for the border

93
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,270
doctors and when I was asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

94
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">breast sold a bit because I you know I</font>

95
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,190
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connotation of bother to be</font>

96
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone negative but ultimately I</font>

97
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,620
realized it was kind of the perfect

98
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,680
description of what you want in a

99
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,780
director what you wanted someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who in</font>

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,320
the face of all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that life</font>

101
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:43,200
throws at us work<font color="#E5E5E5"> school kids daycare</font>

102
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,230
the occasional<font color="#E5E5E5"> flat tire you want</font>

103
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,080
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's going to listen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

104
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:51,090
discordant chorus of voices and

105
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,849
ultimately prioritize yours the voice

106
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the membership because people really are</font>

108
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,980
someday hopefully when we all retire I'd

109
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:06,300
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hand what we've created over to</font>

we've been focusing since then on what

142
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,070
the future vision is how we can go from

143
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,520
being an organization that just puts on

144
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,750
a few conferences to being a more of a

pushing it for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple years</font>

160
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:16,229
although this summer when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we needed the</font>

161
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,969
heavy lifting to actually get it going

162
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,560
my fellow<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kenned Dave Segal who you'll</font>

with having a baby<font color="#CCCCCC"> and various other</font>

things so I'm we've now done one class

167
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,159
on that and the ongoing challenge is to

168
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,159
turn it from a single class into you

169
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,530
know a scalable ongoing program where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

170
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,650
can continue getting new content and

171
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,910
turn that<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a regular thing and I'd</font>

things I've done in my career so as far

as moving nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward um you know you</font>

235
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:18,890
become over the professional services

237
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">really great the educational and</font>

238
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,900
outreach things that people have done I

239
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,810
unfortunately could make it to Portland

240
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,310
which is close to where I live but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

241
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">really impressive what's going on and I</font>

242
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,750
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the development we've had</font>

243
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,000
and I'll say you know I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed</font>

244
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">by the slate that you folks have to vote</font>

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,060
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a lot of good people I mean</font>

246
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,089
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a good bored out of</font>

247
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,770
this however it goes and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

248
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally one of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think</font>

249
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,790
some of the other folks have touched on

250
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,220
a little bit but i'll just say maybe

251
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,500
more explicitly is that you know I've

252
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">been around that nanog have been around</font>

253
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF Aneesa in and some of these</font>

254
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,200
other kinds of industry organizations

255
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,120
like this and one of the things that

256
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've always worked on is trying to bring</font>

257
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,640
a sort of more continuity both on the

258
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,650
top and in the bottom end so we need to

259
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,990
have you know always<font color="#E5E5E5"> be attracting</font>

260
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,910
younger people and you know that's kind

261
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,160
of the lifeblood of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations</font>

262
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:17,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh that's one of the many things I've</font>

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:22,250
later and I still recognize that how

and people and passionate they are

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:50,720
places you'd roll so what I'd like to do

290
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:53,199
it it is not only engineering experience

00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:03,790
we've done a great job of adapting I'm

314
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,339
also the director of network

315
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,199
architecture at Netflix and you know

316
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:12,250
wearing these two hats has given me a

317
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,990
unique perspective at Netflix<font color="#CCCCCC"> where a</font>

318
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,140
platinum sponsor we've hosted two

meetings and you know as a sponsor our

320
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,189
members benefit because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

to sell anything we're here to leverage

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,650
the collective knowledge of this group

323
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,480
right we were not here looking for money

324
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:32,199
so you know these positions are

325
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,330
unrelated but they both help and you

326
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,170
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the other things</font>

327
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've pushed through recently</font>

328
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,589
you've heard a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about the education</font>

329
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,100
program heard a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about now down the</font>

330
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:47,230
road what my real concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what is the</font>

331
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,180
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation of network engineer is</font>

332
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,500
going to look like when we talked about

333
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,060
the education program<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the last</font>

334
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,770
meeting the concern was how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much should</font>

335
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,109
it cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a very simple</font>

336
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,300
answer it should cost as little as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we</font>

337
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibly could charge because we don't</font>

338
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,000
want people who can afford to pay five

339
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,439
thousand dollars for a class or five

340
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,030
hundred dollars for a class we want

341
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,199
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who want to improve their career</font>

342
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,879
and make more money

343
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,319
we presently have to fellowship program

344
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,269
three fellowship programs that invite

345
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,459
two or three college students here a

346
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:16,220
year I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see two or three dozen</font>

347
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,669
college students<font color="#E5E5E5"> here every meeting we</font>

348
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:22,009
are running a<font color="#E5E5E5"> million dollar surplus we</font>

349
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:23,779
should be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that money to get them</font>

350
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:25,189
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry for talking fast but</font>

351
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:28,279
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes of short period of time and</font>

352
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:30,200
so in closing what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

353
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,000
figure out how to use this amazing nest

egg that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're now sitting on which is</font>

355
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,769
the surplus that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to further the</font>

education of the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation of</font>

actually laughing at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a little bit</font>

more procedures so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steve is going to run</font>

423
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">you through these changes so that you</font>

424
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,720
understand why we're recommending the

425
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:30,719
bylaw changes as proposed

426
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:40,090
okay so now we get to the exciting part

427
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,820
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting I spent many fun nights</font>

428
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,699
and weekends working on this my eyes are

429
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,530
blurry well so this really is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an</font>

430
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,260
attempt to rewrite<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bylaws it's an</font>

431
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,600
attempt to reorganize them so that we

432
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,490
can find things better so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when want</font>

433
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,370
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes later it's easier to do</font>

434
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,660
and to remove things that don't really

435
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,860
belong in the bylaws document so what

436
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,790
primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did was take the existing</font>

437
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:08,139
text and change the order the things

438
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,149
that are mazak related<font color="#E5E5E5"> are close to each</font>

439
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,030
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that aren't aren't related</font>

440
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:16,150
or far apart from each other there's

441
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,649
three major sections one over which sort

442
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,900
of an introduction the middle one has

443
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,550
more or less what we do in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of it</font>

444
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,980
is the legal boilerplate stuff that has

445
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:26,139
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there there were a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few changes</font>

446
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that went in is the result of consulting</font>

447
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,220
with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> attorney who said if you want</font>

448
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,060
to stay alive<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really need to do</font>

449
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:36,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things the rest are things that</font>

450
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:38,290
made sense to do we're not terribly

451
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,480
invasive and can help us get on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road</font>

452
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,860
the three<font color="#CCCCCC"> I highlighted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there or gender</font>

453
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,220
neutral language throughout the document

454
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:47,020
so we no longer have a chairman immature

455
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:52,000
woman in a chair object or whatever just

456
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:54,070
a chair<font color="#E5E5E5"> we gave ourselves a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

457
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,840
flexibility with ad hoc committees in

458
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular the ability to appoint</font>

459
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,689
non-members so if for example we needed

460
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,690
a budget or<font color="#CCCCCC"> by our finance committee we</font>

461
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,530
could appoint somebody who had a

462
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">background of expertise in that area</font>

463
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,149
with that having to require them to

464
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,080
eight hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars to be a member and</font>

465
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,330
finally we moved a whole bunch of

466
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,510
details about how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conferences are</font>

467
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:19,659
organized which really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> belong in a</font>

468
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">legal document into a separate set of</font>

469
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:26,050
policies and procedures the other

470
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:28,600
changes were pretty minimal mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

471
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:30,399
changing language to make them again

472
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,590
match what legally was supposed to be

473
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,410
there so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could legally hold</font>

474
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,750
votes and things like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

475
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:41,410
wholesale changes as to what how we

476
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:43,210
operate<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can handle in future</font>

477
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,290
elections if we choose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go that route</font>

478
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,340
or we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave them</font>

479
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,330
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found went through them is</font>

480
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,730
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had a pretty good</font>

481
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,810
document aside from the ordering of

482
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,500
things there wasn't really a whole lot

483
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:57,110
to worry about so with that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

484
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,080
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage everybody to vote YES</font>

485
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:02,300
on the amendment when you vote the

486
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,810
amendment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just replace the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bylaws</font>

487
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,980
wholesale with a new document and at

488
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:10,399
this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll ask if there's any</font>

489
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:14,600
questions on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting and</font>

490
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:25,600
fascinating topic all right then thank

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,419
all have a login and a password and

494

is your organization we're there for

508
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">question and the board members are all</font>

509
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,480
here so you can ask any question you

510
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,480
want

511
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:56,460
hungry all attendees 50 was members or

512
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:59,870
here what is normalization doing looking

513
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,870
to do to improve in

514
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is actually a portion of</font>

515
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,820
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> strategic plan for the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

516
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:24,540
years we do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase the</font>

517
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:27,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">relevance to members at every stage of</font>

518
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,909
their career so what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess</font>

519
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:34,080
is do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> programs in</font>

520
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:36,690
place to appeal to the early career

521
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,000
mid-career late-career engineers and

522
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:42,090
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have we bring you the</font>

523
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,200
right content or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right platform to</font>

524
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:48,270
exchange ideas so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an ongoing</font>

525
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,210
thread and it will be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the</font>

526
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:54,330
priority of the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> board and they will</font>

527
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:58,980
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure this out at the same time</font>

528
00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:01,639
you as a member should suggest start a

529
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:05,370
thread on the membership list and

530
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,910
propose ideas it's your organization you

531
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:12,000
remember it's yours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell us what</font>

532
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:18,210
would mean what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would bring value to you</font>

533
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,650
as a member anymore you on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

534
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,200
maybe other board members who wanted to

535
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:27,330
could also find mice I've actually

536
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,950
debated this myself quite a bit and the

537
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,110
reason why we have members at all is

538
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,940
because legally required<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear we have</font>

539
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of letting officers and</font>

540
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,620
keeping the organization going that said

541
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,400
that's not exciting region you have

542
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:43,169
members one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my goals is to keep nanog</font>

543
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,030
open to everybody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

544
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:48,600
participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever way they can</font>

545
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,399
members are no members in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my view</font>

546
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,969
members are the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually care</font>

547
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,180
enough about the

548
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:57,400
she want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a say in how its run</font>

549
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,040
tell us the board what to do what we're

550
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,180
doing what we're doing wrong and

551
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,370
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on the board or other</font>

552
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,650
communities themselves I don't want to

553
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:09,520
force people to be members because they

554
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:11,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">get fancy trinkets or books or anything</font>

555
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,690
like that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be a nice side</font>

556
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:17,139
effect but it's not a reason to me to

557
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,550
want to become a member now other board

558
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:26,710
members might have different opinions

559
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:29,260
but that's how I did sue today 460

560
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:32,020
members you down you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

561
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:34,330
this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of debate is</font>

562
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:38,740
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should sing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up 100 members</font>

563
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:41,050
or 250 members total mass girl and it
