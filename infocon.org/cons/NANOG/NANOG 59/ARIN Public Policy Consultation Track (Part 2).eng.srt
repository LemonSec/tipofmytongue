complex there are a lot of detailed

<font color="#CCCCCC">they don't and the reasons for the</font>

differences are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always entirely</font>

60
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,990
clear there's also the possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

61
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:17,260
given the requirements in the policy

62
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,870
manual and the realities of ipv4

63
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,090
exhaustion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some small networks may</font>

64
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,340
not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get addresses from there</font>

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,520
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> PS because the ISP simply don't have</font>

66
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,010
anymore and yet they don't qualify for

67
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,040
addresses from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron because of the</font>

68
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:36,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">minimum allocation sizes and such unless</font>

69
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,280
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> wreak wolluf I as an lir or some</font>

70
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,730
such so the attempt here is to simplify

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,680
a portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the policy manual make the</font>

72
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,579
requirements the same in<font color="#E5E5E5"> as many paces</font>

73
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,130
as is feasible there are still many

74
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,200
details around reassignment<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Swift and who is that are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,630
different between what is PS have to do

77
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,370
and what end users have to do but in the

78
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,040
cases where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about how much</font>

79
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,400
space do you qualify<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network of</font>

80
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,350
characteristic x the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

81
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,370
could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that without having to decide</font>

82
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,040
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> network x is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP or an</font>

83
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:18,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">end-user network that happens to have</font>

84
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,108
customers so the attempt here is to keep

85
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,209
it

86
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:23,669
small enough that we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

87
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">changing the entire in rpm at once but</font>

88
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:28,740
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still quite a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit to be changed</font>

89
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:30,990
in order to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happen as we've</font>

90
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,819
discussed with previous proposals this

91
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,099
is a draft policy not a recommended

92
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,689
draft we're not trying to send this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

how this should be developed and get the

text ready for possibly recommending it

97
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:51,599

feedback from all you guys on what we

well this slide we may come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to has</font>

101

104
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:18,060
suggests we do to make them compatible

105
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:20,849
so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first example whereas the</font>

106
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,669
minimum allocation would be a / 24

107
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:26,128
single home than a / 22 or 24 from

108
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:29,330
multihomed the proposed policy would be

109
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:32,879
/ 22 single<font color="#CCCCCC"> homes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or / 24</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Moulton Howe</font>

111
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:39,509
case there's a change for other reasons

112
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:42,330
from both the ISP and end-user policy

113
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,469
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case of the multihomed we</font>

114
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,008
took the one that we felt was more

115
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:49,740
appropriate for everyone based on the

116
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,319
reality is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so there are a</font>

number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in the policy manual</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to choose between if</font>

121
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:03,689
allocations and assignments have the

122
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:06,870
same types of requirements we'll

123
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:10,979
probably get back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these details in a</font>

124
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,779
minute so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> AC needs feedback from the</font>

125
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,370
community these are a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions that</font>

126
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,689
I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with I'm sure you guys will</font>

127
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,599
answer a few questions that are not on

128
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:21,210
this list<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at a high level do you</font>

129
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,659
like the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of consolidating the</font>

130
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,120
policy between ISPs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-users</font>

131
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:28,889
allocations and assignments which of

132
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,090
these requirements do you think we

133
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">should keep</font>

134
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,650
are there any other distinctions besides

135
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,080
the ones remaining with regard to

136
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,289
reassignments etc that need to be

137
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:44,729
maintained keeping ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end-users</font>

138
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,900
distinct if so what and why so with that

139
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,990
I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open up for discussion</font>

140
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,539
there's a number of supporting materials

141
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,400
here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can reference or that Paul</font>

144
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,430
point good to have a fairly open-ended

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,380

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:47,669
could you be a little clearer this is a

162
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,590
really really really bad idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> we spent a</font>

there we go something changes perfect I

gut reaction is that I do not support

the policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for at least the reason that</font>

Owen mentioned and i do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not see enough</font>

190
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:14,870
reason to make this drastic change

191
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:19,490
another item that would need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

192
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:22,480
considered is<font color="#E5E5E5"> membership status for end</font>

194
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:30,560
for if you get it allocation then you

195
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,930
are a member so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also that time to</font>

196
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,459
be considered if we make a change like

197
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,839
this no and I appreciate that that would

198
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,610
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current state but I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font>

199
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you there was a change like this</font>

200
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,240
then the board would probably have to

201
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">reevaluate feed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any time a chain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

202
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,320
policy is made like this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

203
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,820
assume that fee schedules and membership

204
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,280
schedules could be revisited by the

205

the requirements for network operators

to obtain resources either via the free

227
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:53,149
curious some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the earlier comments</font>

about how this would be detrimental or

00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:58,630
undo the

actually take anything away from anybody

233
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:09,430
it actually makes it a lot easier so I'd

234
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:13,349
be really interested in some feedback on

235
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,699
how this is specifically detrimental

a simplification you're actually making

244
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,510
things more complex by creating a

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,290
we've seen to try and bring some sort of

more difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anyone it does not</font>

00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">for your comment far microphone let's</font>

335
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,520
see if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's working for</font>

339
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:26,520
for additional space so let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

340
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:28,349
as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP you at three months you're</font>

only sixty percent utilized of that new

342
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:33,480
block and that mean that you take it

343
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,460
back what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean and then after</font>

344
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that does that mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're still</font>

345

348
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,970
Scott library a sea Shepherd so

349
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,530
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way this has worked and</font>

350
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:58,620
John can clarify is that the requests

351
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,990
are evaluated based on both projections

352
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,320
and more importantly on previous run

353
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,490
rates so if you are on track to use this

354
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,990
much within a certain amount of time

355
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,960
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be allocated the</font>

356
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,610
addresses based on that run rate or if

357
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,850
Renee is not available on good

358
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,669
projections if you if your run rate

359
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,439
changes and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> end up not needing the</font>

360
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:23,160
addresses in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time frame that you</font>

361
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,780
estimated then that will not result in

362
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,970
revocation necessarily but it will

363
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">result in</font>

364
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,320
the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> run rate being evaluated for the</font>

365
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:34,909
next subsequent<font color="#CCCCCC"> request after that is</font>

366
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,679
this also to be applied to the open

367
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,800
resale market now what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

368
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,420
ipv4 so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the policy is</font>

369
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,060
currently written in order to get a

370
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,510
transfer on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer market you must</font>

371
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:49,129
qualify for the addresses from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin so</font>

372
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:53,990
with one exception and if you bring up

373
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:56,030
the little chart thing again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

374
00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:00,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">three month thing at the bottom Center</font>

375
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:04,910
for isps is for addresses directly from

376
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,470
Erin that is 24 months for addresses on

377
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,420
the transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> market so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

378
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,940
distinction at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I can</font>

379
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,070
recall between addresses that you get VA

380
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,960
from Erin versus addresses you get via

381
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,639
transfer otherwise you must meet all the

382
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,750
same requirements so I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what</font>

383
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,330
the results of this will be to a

384
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,700
business which you should care about

385
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:29,780
because in the end that's who pays you

386
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:32,570
is businesses basically the business who

387
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:35,240
runs out of ipv4 space first is no

388
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,950
longer marketable to all of these

389
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,570
companies out there that cannot afford

390
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:44,360
to retool<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to v6 I hope I said</font>

391
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:47,060
before did I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it backwards whoever</font>

392
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,149
runs out of v4 first is the first one

393
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,560
whose business slows down to a crawl

394
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,720
based on the way this thing is written

395
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,250
so I'm not understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you think</font>

396
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things worse for</font>

397
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,440
acquiring space on the transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> market</font>

398
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:02,540
so i will just put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

399
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,240
choose not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> v</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the transfer</font>

400
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:08,270
market you go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get space</font>

401
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:12,560
and what I'm finding is that here go

402
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:14,620
ahead and take I don't know a 24 which

403
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,790
could last you how long with customers

404
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:20,629
not very long at all are you asking

405
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:22,670
customers to come directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you if</font>

406
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,650
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking for a 22 you're not</font>

407
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:28,850
lasting very long at all either as a

408
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:31,460
service provider so if you if you

409
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:35,780
qualify for space from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron and you</font>

410
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,180
need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> slash 18 to meet your six-month</font>

411
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,350
requirement then they will approve you

412
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,450
for a / 18

413
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,159
if the if the / 18 is available in the

414
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:46,070
free pool you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get bad this doesn't</font>

415
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,690
change that portion of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things work I</font>

416
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,370
don't understand the<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay no that</font>

417
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,530
clarity<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoped yeah the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> policy the policy</font>

418
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:54,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">is only affecting since transfers or</font>

419
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:57,168
free pool require the justification is

420
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,879
just talking about justification I think

421
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:02,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe the misunderstanding there is the</font>

422
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,070
first row is the minimum there's no

423
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,230
there is no maximum defined in this

424
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,789
policy or in current policy for the

432
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:31,129
I strongly oppose this policy first of

all as a matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good policy making</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in doing so it was a number of changes</font>

to both it<font color="#E5E5E5"> chooses their worst of each</font>

439
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:51,380
policy and we end up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

440
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,139
is so incredibly hard for any of us

441
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:57,620
first we need a chart to explain what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

442
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,780
does and it ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> up changing so many</font>

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,969
areas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy beyond simply</font>

444
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,270
emerging those<font color="#E5E5E5"> two if we're</font>

445
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:07,730
contemplating this level of change it

446
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,168
needs to be much clearer and it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

447
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,640
be spread<font color="#E5E5E5"> out amongst a number of</font>

448
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:16,309
policies and draft proposals because we

449
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,850
shouldn't this is a wholesale rewrite of

450
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:22,340
both lar and end-user policy that

451
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,168
dramatically changes both also<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

452
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,080
matter of policy making I have those

453
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:29,840
policies that would tweak only the v4

454
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,970
and not to be six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that</font>

455
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,039
particularly cope with guitar stress

456
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:39,260
again um suddenly um this policy has the

457
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,789
interesting side effect of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> viscera</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

458
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the needs basis for initial allocation</font>

459
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:47,270
because it uses for looking criteria

460
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:49,250
only it's not captured well here on this

461
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:52,460
chart that if you read the policy

462
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:56,570
language you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that that</font>

463
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,669
holds true<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and finally I think more</font>

464
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,158
fundamentally this policy strives to

465
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:04,610
solve problem it's much more easily

466
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:07,250
tackled in other ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> the this seems to</font>

467
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,080
be solving a problem having difficulty

468
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,940
identifying whether an organization

470

00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,200
the organization to<font color="#CCCCCC"> self identified when</font>

472

473
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,710

474
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:24,409
guidance when appropriate in that

475
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:28,010
respect and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a big</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">problem I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have that many</font>

477
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,760
organizations out there that easily

478
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,120
qualify for both and are just making the

wrong choice an eyedropper wrong choices

480
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,149
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to try to reduce this</font>

481
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,370
level of dramatic change simply to

482
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:46,279
merely simplify how an organization

483
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:49,370
chooses to to classify and and and

484
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,500
receive resources is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue much and</font>

485
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,449
it changes things too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so I</font>

I think I'm friends with facebook on

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,900
only synchronize the criteria and not

make any other changes such that

510

512
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,580
policy proposal but I'm afraid it looks

513
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,000
like it's actually eight policy

514
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:07,678
proposals in one and if you add v6

515
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,090
that's two more so it's for a lot of

<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's looking like it's</font>

others want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to more so so posed at this</font>

from kevin<font color="#E5E5E5"> adi i concur</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

522
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:35,370
assertion that v4 only policies are a

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,689
bad idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> TM furthermore any policies</font>

524
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,809
should strongly encourage the adoption

525
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:44,370
of ipv6 rather than keeping ipv4 on life

526
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:47,129
support thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their comment now</font>

529

going to be a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> not probe</font>

530
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:59,370
against at this time because I believe

531
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:03,929
this policy needs a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> work before I</font>

532
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:07,739
could support it but I believe this is

533
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:10,260
missing the evil that lurks below we do

534
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:13,110
have one key differentiator between ipv4

535
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:16,020
and ipv6 which is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not out of ipv6</font>

536
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,729
we're an end<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're end of days with</font>

before

538
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:23,840
and there are aspects of the current

<font color="#CCCCCC">northam that fundamentally don't work</font>

mechanism is a critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue because it</font>

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:43,490
doesn't work in the transfer market when

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 24-22 so I believe</font>

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:50,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that oh yes we do actually need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

work on v4 that is separate from v6 but

547
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:58,100
what we're looking for is this is not

548
00:26:53,380 --> 00:27:01,460
2013 issues this is 2014 2015 issues and

549
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,909
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear out the aspects of the</font>

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,919
NR p.m. that conflict with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reality</font>

551
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:11,059
which is a transfer market versus a

00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:13,929
vehicle and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so your proposed to know I</font>

would support I don't believe tweaking

556

some numbers to synchronize is is

00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:51,009
for a world or transfers happen and I

565
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:53,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our painting to</font>

568
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:02,620
because it's doing a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the</font>

chart on the screen suggests<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

to draw on three things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in particular</font>

571
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,840
but there's many more than just these

572
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:11,799
three the first I want to talk about is

573
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,590
a removal of slow start mm-hmm yes slow

574
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:16,570
start is very important I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

575
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,039
should be removing it incorrect I think

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,830
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to figure out how to make it</font>

577
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:24,059
work in a transfer market so I think

578
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:27,610
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a movement in the wrong direction</font>

579
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:31,870
79 Colin is moving to a 12 month supply

580
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:34,990
as opposed to report a long time back we

581
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:38,258
had 12 months there was a discussion to

582
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:40,600
move it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a quarter I opposed that I</font>

583
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:44,710
felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you shouldn't change the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rules</font>

584
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:47,340
of the game so<font color="#E5E5E5"> why and we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do</font>

585
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:51,009
business as usual one run till we're out

586
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:53,110
but nevertheless we changed it now we're

587
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:55,000
talking about changing it back I am

588
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:58,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's changing it back because you</font>

589
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,230
shouldn't change the finish line even

590
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:03,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">though it's what you originally wanted</font>

591
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:06,970
no I understand the principle is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

592
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:09,899
change I understand so I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

593
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:13,539
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> change and the</font>

594
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:16,779
is right now all justification is based

595
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:18,370
on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> current utilization what did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

596
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:20,710
use in the last quarter what did you use

597
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:23,229
in the last year and projecting what

598
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:25,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">your next year's need is based on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

599
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,610
you used last year and if you need more

600
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:31,928
than that well when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you come back again</font>

601
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:33,850
and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely gone it seems to</font>

602
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:36,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">me a lot of the justification for</font>

603
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:39,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">address that we currently use would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

604
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,549
eliminated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this with this proposal</font>

605
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:46,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if the way I read it it seems like</font>

606
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:49,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could base a request strictly on a</font>

607
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:50,679
future projection of need as in I'm

608
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:55,330
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about starting an ISP at my</font>

609
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,500
house and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I / 8 please I don't</font>

610
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this is a move in the right</font>

611
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,260
direction it also completely removes the

612
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:06,010
section about how to judge utilization

613
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,340
for web hosting which I admit is kind of

614
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,679
vague but now it would be non-existent

615
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:14,678
so I I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes away a lot of the</font>

616
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:18,549
good advice to air and staff on how to

617
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:21,130
judge need realization so so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

618
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:23,980
things that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think really need to stay</font>

619
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,149
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy as we run out as we</font>

620
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,429
approach run out and even in the

621
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:29,289
transfer market because you know i think

622
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:30,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">the needs basis that we've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using up</font>

623
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:32,379
until now is fair and should be

624
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,179
continued there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

625
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,190
things removes the non-guaranteed<font color="#E5E5E5"> rat</font>

626
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:39,279
ability remove references to 2050

627
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:42,820
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big long list but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um I hit the</font>

628
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:47,740
major ones thank you very much Jason the

629
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:53,320
last comment sir dan alexander arenae

630
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:57,460
see there are two problems that were

631
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">both in staff comments you know the the</font>

632
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">feedback presentations of prior meetings</font>

633
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:05,960
and just conversations that have come

634
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:09,109
mailing list and so forth there's as we

635
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:14,149
go into this depletion we're already

636
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:17,059
seeing cases where people are gaming the

637
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:19,399
definitions saying I'm I'm not an end

638
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:23,899
user I'm an ISP or I'm not a nice p.m.

639
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:26,149
and end user in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to either save</font>

640
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:29,330
money on fees or to meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

641
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:33,968
requirements to obtain resources via

642
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:39,830
transfer from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> free pool so these</font>

643
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:44,179
these the split requirements is already

644
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:47,178
showing signs of issues which is one of

645
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reasons why this attempted to do</font>

646
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:52,369
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some of those to prevent all</font>

647
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:57,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the confusion that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> staff has to deal</font>

648
00:31:52,369 --> 00:32:01,369
with and potentially move to a cleaner

649
00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:04,309
model there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-world cases</font>

650
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:06,439
where network operators when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin's free</font>

651
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:08,749
pool runs out are not going to be able

652
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,460
to get addresses from Erin they're not

653
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:13,279
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to get addresses from</font>

654
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:15,279
their upstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and they're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

655
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">to meet the requirements for a transfer</font>

656
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:23,389
so there's a large policy hole that

657
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:25,580
currently exists as the policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> manual is</font>

658
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:28,189
currently written that's going to

659
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:30,739
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave a lot of people with</font>

660
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:36,320
no options which is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> this also</font>

661
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:41,089
attempted to address the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comments</font>

662
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,918
about that this I was kind of struck

663
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:45,769
because it's hard to thread the needle

664
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,049
where you both get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comments that</font>

665
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:51,019
this is an omnibus proposal and there's

666
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:54,499
too many changes but at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time it</font>

667
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:57,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't address v6 so it's incomplete I</font>

668
00:32:54,499 --> 00:33:02,179
don't know how you can how you can

669
00:32:57,739 --> 00:33:05,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">satisfy both of those criticisms this</font>

670
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:08,920
was trying to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a certain set of</font>

671
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:14,830
criteria without making it overly come

672
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:18,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Plex including v6 so we'll have to keep</font>

673
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:20,679
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the language I settled those</font>

674
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:22,900
comments look at I respond to that yes

675
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,110
yes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my sure I think the way you</font>

676
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:28,930
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that is you implement as we</font>

677
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,550
pointed out eight policies or three

678
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,250
policies or four policies or ever many

679
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:36,550
policies that deal with v4 and v6 on a

680
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,140
particular topic so you you tackle the

681
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,629
minimum initial allocation and

682
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,250
assignment size for v4 and v6 right

683
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:44,200
there's there's ways to do this in the

684
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:46,840
standard incremental model that we

685
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,430
typically used to make policy changes

686
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,730
that don't involve a wholesale rewrite

687
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:53,740
of the entire v4 and v6 sections of the

688
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:56,110
number does the AC chair have any

in doing so that we quickly go down
