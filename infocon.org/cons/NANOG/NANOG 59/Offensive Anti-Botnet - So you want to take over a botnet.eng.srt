00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,219
sup we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> David Dietrich with the</font>

2
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,270
University of Washington talking about

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,270
anti botnet measures

4
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay um thanks and then I program</font>

5
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,289
committee for allowing me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,640
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> today I am and the slides are I</font>

7
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,950
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them up on the URL</font>

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,410
here but i will have these and some

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,920
other resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in a little bit</font>

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,239
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about there been a</font>

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,980
bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people wanting to take down</font>

12
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,500
botnets for various reasons what are

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,910
those reasons so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that</font>

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,269
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking about doing this</font>

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,309
since things seem to be escalating in a

16
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:55,710
number of different ways what is it that

17
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need to do as a community differently</font>

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,420
to be more effective to up our game a

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,589
little bit we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,540
enough time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through the case</font>

21
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:05,700
studies but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have some here in case</font>

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,220
people have some questions they kind of

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,070
may come up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and there's a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">write up paper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i did at leat i</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more detail on these case</font>

28
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,539
studies so how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here have</font>

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,460
some frustration at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

doing things especially things that last

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,449

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,590
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping I should have some</font>

out kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talked about what's the</font>

architecture etc had a very interesting

set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information the very end what</font>

should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do and obviously you can't</font>

53
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:38,929
read this what should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do we need to</font>

54
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,420
put people<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind bars that's the only</font>

55
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,430
way this is going to stop in order for

56
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,690
us to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to be granted the</font>

57
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,700
right to take over botnets and use them

58
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,280
in investigations we need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> given</font>

59
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,230
exemptions from things like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

60
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,120
front of you sacked so that we're not

61
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,869
held liable if we caused damage to

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,660
systems we need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> given warrants or</font>

63
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,190
special powers kind of Kwazii law

64

enforcement to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to go do</font>

65
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:10,220
investigations using these stolen

66
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:12,140
resources and they again say well the

67
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,000
public wants is to we did this poll it

68
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,609
says eighty-four percent want us to go

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,170
clean these machines up so the argument

70
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,190
is coming out more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and if</font>

71
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,609
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start thinking about</font>

72
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,470
doing things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aggressive</font>

73
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,989
there are a bunch of ethical standards

74
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:33,100
and norms that guide us how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

75
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:36,019
here are members of I Triple E or ACM

76
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay how many of those who raise their</font>

77
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:40,100
hands kind of think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

78
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,250
ethics on a daily basis for guiding the

79
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,510
way that they make<font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions and I'll</font>

80
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,230
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons why you</font>

81
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:51,620
probably do in a minute for those of you

82
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,109
that work in universities who are doing

83
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,780
what's known as human subjects research

84
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,100
there are laws that guide these things

85
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,769
called institutional review boards

86
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:04,450
they're called research research ethics

87
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:06,769
boards in some other countries and

88
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,690
there's also this you know if you're

89
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about I have a right to</font>

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,760
are the laws of armed conflict the

<font color="#CCCCCC">the ethical principles necessity defense</font>

justifying using force in self-defense

146
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:39,550
so this active response continuum thing

147
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,670
there are various<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels of capability</font>

148
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:45,340
or understanding that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have about</font>

149
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,530
security and defensive mechanisms and

150
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,030
how to clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and mitigate things so</font>

151
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,280
at the very bottom you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

152
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,200
that just absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> no nothing you know</font>

153
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,349
the grandparents that by a computer or a

given one and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know nothing</font>

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,599
this community is level three you have

the whole thing up it's level<font color="#CCCCCC"> four where</font>

there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and that's where</font>

reaching out into other people's

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:32,950
networks that might be considered a use

168
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:37,539
of force in some context and potentially

169
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:40,090
are the retaliation sort of things when

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:43,600
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussing this we realized well</font>

173
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:51,610
being less intrusive to more intrusive

less noticeable or harmful less risky

175
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:59,610
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be capable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

176
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,870
justifying what it is that you're doing

181
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,860
to go through this<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a</font>

182
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,170
progressive way working as much as you

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,580
can towards cooperation reporting to

184
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,430
people making sure that they do their

185
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,849
thing and not just jumping to automatic

186
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:27,100
strike back or counter strike we<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer</font>

the phrase active response<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue them</font>

188
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,570
because it sort of stresses there is a

189
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,699
continuum there is a range<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and</font>

190
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,179
you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider everything along</font>

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,180
that range

192
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:51,320
now what is the easiest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do the</font>

193
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:53,970
least intrusive and least sort of

194
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,370
disruptive is just the collecting

195
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,230
intelligence thing and people poke

196
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,630
around if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a system</font>

201
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">start getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the more disruptive</font>

202
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,729
things and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people here remember</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Burman Coble bill MPAA and RIAA</font>

204
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:20,010
we're asking for modifications to

Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to grant

206

them just the media industry the right

to find systems that are distributing

copyright material enter those systems

209
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,140
and disable them so shut off the network

210

interface of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system in a peer-to-peer</font>

files they didn't get that law passed

213
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,569
but every now and then people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are asking</font>

214
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,579
and right now there's a bunch of

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,680
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> about we need to modify the</font>

back and make the adversaries pay make

around again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again the main</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

222
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,949
here is that all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things involve</font>

223
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,680
doing things outside of your zone of

224
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,900
authority without any cooperation of the

225
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,670
people who own those or operate those

226
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:17,850
resources so if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

227
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:20,130
about dealing with botnets and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

228
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:24,060
to the naming thing in a little bit I

229
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,950
mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a notional graph but it's</font>

230
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,079
fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to just sandbox things</font>

231
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,030
figure out how something talks to a

232
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,310
command and control server maybe get the

233
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,740
password etc you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start using the</font>

234
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,469
passwords start manipulating the botnet

235
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,690
it's when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> start getting up to I want</font>

236
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,790
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing all of those hundreds</font>

237
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,830
of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of computers go to my sink</font>

238
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,189
hole and take them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of control the</font>

239
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:49,560
bad guy or go clean them up that things

240
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,470
get really complicated really technical

241
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,619
and really risky

242
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,750
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not seeing a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

243
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,450
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know I've made it</font>

244
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,800
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an exponential graph here</font>

245
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,710
they think it's more of a linear<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

246
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,900
and that it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really that hard or</font>

247
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:10,010
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that risky and I want to disabuse</font>

248
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:13,579
people of that thought there's been a

249
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:15,530
bunch of thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this in various</font>

250
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,890
contexts and the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paper that</font>

251
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:21,470
I've read<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of looks at things</font>

252
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,060
in a little bit more complex way than we

253
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,210
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the active response continuum</font>

254
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,160
Dorothy Denning was trying to use the

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">DoD policy for active air and missile</font>

256
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,589
defense and just substitute the word

257
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:37,040
cyber for air and missile<font color="#E5E5E5"> and think</font>

258
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:39,680
through what DoD has thought about in

259
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,030
terms of defensive mechanisms and they

260
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,329
clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> differentiate things that are</font>

261
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:46,490
active versus passive so this whole

262
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,290
active defense thing some of the active

263
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:52,150
defense things are honey pots and is a

264
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:54,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">honey pot active maybe maybe not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

265
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,670
there's a bunch of argument about words

266
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,060
and we'll see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over in this</font>

talk the four dimensions that she

270
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,710
what's the degree of cooperation because

271
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,960
actually it's not just they cooperate or

272
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:14,750
they don't cooperate there are

273
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,460
gradations of that and then type of

274
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,770
effects and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of automation so</font>

275
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,900
how quickly does something happen and if

276
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,850
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like going out and</font>

277
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,790
automatically shutting off computers or

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,550
things like that the degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:34,010
automation<font color="#E5E5E5"> the speed and the scope can</font>

proportionality non-combatant immunity

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,490
so you're not supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack</font>

you shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,630
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in a self-defense mode when</font>

290
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,630
that is justifiable

291
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,620
there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been another effort that is</font>

292
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,359
more on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research context that's been</font>

293
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,160
going on for quite a while how many

294
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">people here have heard the word metal or</font>

295
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:19,600
the words<font color="#CCCCCC"> Menlo report the name melon</font>

296
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:22,480
report only<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so DHS has</font>

297
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,940
had these series<font color="#CCCCCC"> of workshops and I and</font>

298
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,020
erin connealy been the lead authors on

299
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,870
the documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been published</font>

300
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is to try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

301
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,150
this institutional review board human

302
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,949
subjects evaluation mechanism and apply

303
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:41,130
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to information and communication</font>

304
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,130
technology research so how do you get

305
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,150
consent from users how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you protect</font>

306
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,120
data how do you choose subjects in a way

307
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:51,400
that is fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> and balanced and how did</font>

308
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:57,010
the results get published in a way that

309
00:13:51,400 --> 00:14:01,510
balances every benefit society in an

310
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:04,120
equitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> way so these first three sets</font>

311
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,150
are the basic principles that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are used</font>

312
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:11,800
by biomedical and behavioral researchers

313
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:13,240
the fourth one that we added compliance

314
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,120
with the law and public interest is

315
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,700
basic respect for the law<font color="#E5E5E5"> and public</font>

316
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,020
interest is basically trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very</font>

317
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:25,540
transparent about what it is you're

318
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:28,030
doing the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's the most</font>

319
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,150
beneficial here that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

320
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">bringing over into this whole talk is</font>

321
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:35,530
doing a comprehensive stakeholder

322
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,240
analysis you want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

323
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,699
mechanism that's used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the</font>

324
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,110
software engineering field as well as

325
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:47,230
the there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> association of social</font>

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">anthropologists in the UK that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uses this</font>

327

methodology for understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

328
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:56,860
delivery<font color="#CCCCCC"> of aid to afflicted communities</font>

329
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,420
in various countries and things can get

330
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,300
really really complicated so you think

331
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,650
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all primary stakeholders</font>

332
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,829
they're the ones who you're trying to

333
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:08,560
benefit but they're also can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative</font>

334
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,420
stakeholders you if you're in a area

335
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,209
that's under conflict and there is

336
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,219
warring factions things that you do the

337
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,689
aid might actually go to the

338
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,240
guys rather than to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

339
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:20,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">to benefit in our case you publish some</font>

340
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,810
information about some malware

341
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:25,569
vulnerability the bad guys might use it

342
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:27,609
fix their malware so you have to think

343
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:29,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> range there the</font>

344
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,810
secondary stakeholders are the

345
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,149
intermediaries so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font>

346
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:36,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">here that operate networks it's not your</font>

347
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:38,800
computers that are affected it's your

348
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,769
customers computers there are malicious

349
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,329
data is transiting your networks and the

350
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:46,120
key stakeholders are the ones that

351
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:49,060
actually have an impact in the delivery

352
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:58,389
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the benefits or the harms so that</font>

353
00:15:49,060 --> 00:16:02,050
includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad guys I've now got four</font>

354
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:03,879
different examples of how to do this

355
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,878
stakeholder analysis in a bunch of

356
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:09,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">different contexts one of them is remote</font>

357
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:15,910
mitigation of botnets with a couple of

358
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:16,779
researchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> from Germany so if we're</font>

361
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:21,279
there's a bunch of things that we need

362
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:25,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about in order to do it the</font>

363
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:28,000
right way first of all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to name</font>

364
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,500
things better and be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

365
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,720
scientific about the way that we

366
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,559
categorize things have some kind of a

367
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,600
taxonomy that makes sense and not just

368
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,730
come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a new name just because we</font>

369
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,259
can claim first discovery of something

370
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:46,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that actually is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's been</font>

371
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:48,490
around for a long time it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing counts</font>

372
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,878
based on IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then calling</font>

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">those infections is terrible because we</font>

374
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,930
all know IP addresses change so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

375
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,809
can't count things<font color="#E5E5E5"> accurately and can't</font>

376
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,790
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we count them what good's</font>

377
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,050
the number other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the number</font>

378
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,490
bigger than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number that someone</font>

379
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,109
reported so that a reporter will

380
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,280
actually take your questions and then

381
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,280
publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> something with your name in it</font>

382
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,740
we need to start taking a much higher

383
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:17,110
level view rather than just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

384
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,220
whatever we think is the the thing right

385
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:22,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">in front of us that's on fire and</font>

386
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,569
actually be a little bit less

387
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,879
competitive to make sure that you know

388
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:31,110
we as a team are dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with things</font>

389
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:36,220
and not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving up to the bad guys</font>

390
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:37,709
and part of this is about integrity and

391
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,760
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have their own</font>

392
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">definition of what integrity is the</font>

393
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,260
definition I use is the one came up that

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">Steven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Carter came up with you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

395
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,040
right and wrong you make your choices

396
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,860
based on your understanding of right and

397
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:54,129
wrong even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that costs you in some way</font>

398
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,290
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be able to win somebody</font>

399
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you about it openly and clearly</font>

400
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:01,870
explain how you came to your decision if

401
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,580
you can't do that and if it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

402
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a self-serving thing that you did</font>

403
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,710
then people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be calling you on it</font>

404
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,940
and as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> community we should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standing</font>

405
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:16,180
up a little bit more when it comes to

406
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:19,660
names I now hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name bot and bot</font>

407
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,370
net it is so meaningless and how many

408
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">times do you see people say oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

409
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,989
an infected machine on my network can

410
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,700
somebody give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP of the C&C well</font>

411
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,820
in a peer-to-peer network there may be

412
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,160
hundreds thousands of what looked like

413
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">c2c what's the difference between a</font>

414
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:40,780
remote file injection or RFI server and

415
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,700
a dropper or a dropper framework we've

416
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,840
got just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many names people keep</font>

417
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,510
coming up with these different names

418
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,189
mothership is a mothership command and

419
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:53,230
control server or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a command</font>

420
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:56,080
control server now we're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

421
00:18:53,230 --> 00:19:01,690
that with adversaries so we've got a PT

422
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:04,710
1 and we've got comment crew<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dell likes</font>

423
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,210
to name things based on the tools

424
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,420
CrowdStrike likes to name things based

425
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:14,830
on where they claim the region is of the

426
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:16,510
attacker so if we're now using different

427
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,020
names to talk about the same group and

428
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,910
we have tools tactics and procedures or

429
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,220
we have some information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about campaign</font>

430
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,400
level activity over time do we have two

431
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,320
campaigns we have one campaign if you

432
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,910
find some other victims and you go start

433
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,060
talking to them and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the wrong</font>

434
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,890
word then they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually know what</font>

435
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,690
is you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I had this</font>

436
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,760
happened one time with<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone who first</font>

437
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,470
said do you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about sit at</font>

438
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">all okay well I haven't read about said</font>

439
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,410
it'll have absolutely no idea what's

440
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,000
digital is about well it's a variant of

441
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,160
Zeus okay Zeus I know it's deuce is

442
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,220
about everything is clear so just in a

443
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:55,690
flash you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> from no knowledge at all to</font>

444
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:59,080
a great deal of knowledge but we don't

445
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:01,870
do that very well here's a little

446
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,429
diagram of this multi-phase operation

447
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,310
which we often don't take into

448
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:10,810
consideration so here's a web server

449
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:13,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has iframes that's part of the</font>

450
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:16,510
browser infection there may be a browser

451
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,850
exploit kit that is part of a dropper

452
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:22,030
framework that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to try and</font>

453
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:26,439
exploit you once your exploited you now

454
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:28,660
get code loaded in this case meh brute

455
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,330
so there's a rootkit there's a command

456
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,030
and control server for the configuration

457
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:37,360
files there's actually a caching server

458
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,800
which they call<font color="#E5E5E5"> at or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pic C&C server so</font>

459
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are dual roles there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one's</font>

460
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">controlling ones receiving and then an</font>

461
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,040
injection server which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

462
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,670
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the vulnerable web server</font>

463
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,500
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side in some ways and then</font>

464
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,990
you see another description of very

465
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,940
similar things where that whole diagram

466
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,350
that we just looked at is now the little

467
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:01,270
grimacing email on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the upper left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

468
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:04,360
now the browser exploit kit is called

469
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:07,120
out specifically Zeus and see inject

470
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:11,709
which is the last point of the infection

471
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,060
arm of the dropper and multiple

472
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,890
different browser exploits that are

473
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,419
involved and those can keep continuing

474
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,070
so those things are talking about the

475
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">same different thing from complete from</font>

476
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:24,450
two different perspectives and you don't

477
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">really see the commonality between them</font>

478
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:31,929
and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here have heard Paul</font>

479
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">vixy used this phrase range of the</font>

480
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:41,860
moment I didn't quite understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at</font>

481
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:46,750
first if you know geology how much

482
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:48,629
energy is released in an earthquake just

483
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,830
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy to go back to equilibrium</font>

484
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,240
so the range of the moment in an

485
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,840
earthquake is the total amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy</font>

486
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,669
released

487
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,779
in this context it's you see something

488
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:02,900
there's a command and control server

489
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:04,190
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to make the botnet stop all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

490
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,110
have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is take the command control</font>

491
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,500
server out I do what I need to do it's

492
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,908
done so just doing enough to<font color="#CCCCCC"> solve</font>

493
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,770
whatever you think the immediate<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

494
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:15,200
is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of you is acting on the</font>

495
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:18,080
range of the moment that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working</font>

496
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,850
for us that's whack Amole so we need to

497
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,678
be much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more sophisticated about this if</font>

498
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:26,510
we're going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work and here's</font>

499
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:29,809
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking about with taking the</font>

500
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:33,260
bigger view if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the documents</font>

502
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,450
sinkhole there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of information</font>

503
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:40,729
there about why it was done who did it

504
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:48,230
there's a stakeholder analysis in there

505
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:51,350
and in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> faq we answer these questions</font>

506
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">about who are the stakeholders etc I'm</font>

507
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,899
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of breeze through some of</font>

508
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:55,899
those because we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

509
00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:03,169
so the bond I was taken down and not

510
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,580
long after that within a couple of days

511
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:07,210
people were saying well it's not really

512
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,770
down i'm still seeing spam coming up

513
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:15,080
well was it taken down or was it not

514
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:18,460
taken down here is a thing called virus

515
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:22,010
which recently was explained or was

516
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,720
announced to be promoting wala deck

that's been around since at least 2007

00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:19,090
spammed the spam directs you to the

if your browser is vulnerable it then

580
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,790
those things do spamming to keep the

581
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:34,120
thing going and the little box in the

582
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:36,670
upper left is the portion of the bots at

583
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,070
the time of the sinkhole that were taken

<font color="#CCCCCC">over they were effectively</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sync hold but</font>

585
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,649
if you ignore all the propagation within

00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:46,660
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> they simply went out and bought</font>

587
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,970
some more and they were back up and

588
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,190
running and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a little botnet</font>

589
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,830
version see down the bottom and the new

590
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,960
variant basically only had new

591
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,629
encryption keys and a couple of bug

592
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,100
fixes that were in the pipeline so the

range<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the moment solution didn't</font>

594

595
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:07,480
back up and running so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able go through the case studies but</font>

604

was in a bulletproof hoster and it was

605
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:37,240
really hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that shut down when</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mariposa working group did some</font>

611
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,960
say that in the public documents that

612
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,000
are out there they lost control of part

613
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,559
of the resource the command control

614
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,780
resources for a short period of time the

615
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,970
bad guy took it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over did a denial</font>

616
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,370
service attack against who he thought

617
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,230
was trying to take over his<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

618
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:07,000
there were other people using the same

619
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,820
networks as a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was targeted</font>

620
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,679
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> innocent people had suffered an</font>

621
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,899
outage because of this 900 megabit per

second d das that lasted eight to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

623
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:21,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours and it was an accident that he the</font>

624
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,440
guy tripped up didn't use his VPN logged

625
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,960
into one of the resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> that got an IP</font>

626
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,330
address turned out to be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

627
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,539
he had registered or had used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

628
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,389
registration of

629
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:33,830
a domain at some point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was given to</font>

630
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:37,728
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Spanish police the Spanish police</font>

631
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:40,639
did arrest him so if ends justify the

632
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:43,100
means and if you ignore the fact that

633
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:45,799
there was this attack and it was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

634
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,769
luck you know it's a success the guy was

635
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,408
arrested but anybody who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

636
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:53,869
after a botnet operator in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of</font>

637
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:57,399
aggressive away from now on should know

638
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:59,418
or should expect you might be attacked

639
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:00,709
so if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use your own</font>

640
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:02,359
network or if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

641
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,849
network to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with others they may be</font>

642
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,649
affected and if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and</font>

643
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:09,619
hide yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> by using somebody elses</font>

644
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:13,039
network you're not going to get attacked

645
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:15,439
they're going to get attacked so the

646
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,779
whole comprehensive stakeholder analysis

647
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,190
thing will help you think through the

648
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:22,519
right way to go about doing all this

649
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:25,179
stuff so that harm is minimized benefits

650
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:25,179
are maximized

651
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,820
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a summary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little this</font>

652
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,419
table is a little bit bigger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

653
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:48,310
one that's in my lead paper but if you

654
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:52,150
look at this there are a lot of major

655
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:53,710
variances in the numbers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are quoted</font>

656
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:58,330
by various people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to count these</font>

657
00:29:53,710 --> 00:30:00,790
things the length of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time that some of</font>

658
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,949
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> bots have been up in some cases</font>

659
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the longest one there i think is core</font>

660
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:09,040
fled<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years supposedly the core</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fled</font>

661
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,750
had been active and there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

662
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,840
multiple takedown attempts on some of

663
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:16,020
these the ones that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first did</font>

664
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,330
this paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was trying to analyze is</font>

665
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:21,040
using legal process either criminal or

666
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,320
civil legal process in conjunction with

667
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,540
technical means something that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

668
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,750
get a better outcome and it seemed like

669
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,370
the answer was yes and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

670
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:35,380
started reminding me well wait a second

671
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:39,729
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kelly oz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wallah deck</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wala</font>

672
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:43,180
deck was a variant of storm or a

673
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:46,590
precursor storm was a precursor to wall

674
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,880
attack so from that perspective maybe

675
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:52,020
when Microsoft first took it down you

676
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,730
can't call that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a total success but</font>

677
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:57,310
Microsoft has managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the guy who</font>

678
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:00,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrote it to plead in court yes I wrote</font>

679
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,830
it the other take down operations have

680
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,110
not come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with those kinds of outcomes</font>

681
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,909
so if the goal as kaspersky was saying

682
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,639
in their blog is to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> people behind</font>

683
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">bars we need to do things that will</font>

684
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,140
assist law enforcement in doing their

685
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:16,149
job to put people<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind bars just going</font>

686
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,930
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our own might not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

687
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,930
getting those effects

688
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:32,359
so the biggest thing is don't use IP

689
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:37,969
addresses for counting and don't claim

690
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:40,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">that an IP address is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infection there</font>

691
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,720
is a big incentive to inflate numbers if

692
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:45,399
you're a company and you provide

693
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,779
services you need some publicity but

694
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:49,488
everybody question numbers whenever

695
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:51,080
somebody tells you something ask what's

696
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:53,210
the counting methodology how long did

697
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,330
you count and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

698
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:59,269
time that the count takes place matters

699
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:04,100
a huge amount these guys have

700
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:08,929
subsequently done a paper for getting

701
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,678
the name of the paper they've been

702
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at a bunch of different</font>

703
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,570
peer-to-peer<font color="#E5E5E5"> BOTS and they did counts of</font>

704
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,289
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

705
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:23,779
this graph this is the first five days

00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:27,049
or six days of the 2012<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kelly us take</font>

712

down because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a certain place in</font>

00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,919
if you notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're close to in line</font>

00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,700
there's another one and various networks

have different latency for change

738
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,439
turn it on so every network is going to

00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,149
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different function and that means</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that the longer that you count the</font>

00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:12,639
use that to your advantage to make more

00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,849
very well when talking about things and

752
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,280
the role matters at least with the

where I've got alerts saying Zeus bad

768
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:21,549
because some IP address was on a

infect and I have websense or something

772
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:34,420
that blocks it then who cares if its

00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,560
command and control or it's going out to

these alerts about not just what malware

but what role that will help and it's

785
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably safe to say that combining</font>

00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,078
legal and technical means has a better

787
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:17,099
result than just trying to do a

801
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:54,540
then automatically they're doing bad

stuff again so net-net it might not have

been again

804
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:08,300
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one other really good benefit to</font>

805
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:11,869
the court action that Microsoft has been

00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:15,020
doing and that is they are effectively

807
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:18,230
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stakeholder analysis in order to</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain things should be done</font>

810
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,040
Microsoft's not acting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their own but</font>

811
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,829
I assisted them with some declarations

812
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,779
in at least two of the cases and those

813
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:33,079
documents are there to explain to the

814
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:35,270
court here is how this specific malware

832
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:20,030
took into consideration when they made

833
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:22,670
this action how did they ensure that

834
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:25,609
they were causing minimal harm what were

835
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:28,040
the fall backs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had what other</font>

836
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:29,710
alternatives were there to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and meet</font>

837
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,359
the objective and what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the objective</font>

840
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:44,210
activity is that a justifiable risk to

841
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:47,300
be taking and just having these

842
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:50,540
discussions sometimes causes some strife

843
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:52,940
and so we need to have these discussions

844
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:56,859
if we can have them in private venues

845
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:59,180
fine but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to up the game I think</font>

846
00:38:56,859 --> 00:39:00,500
if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get more aggressive if</font>

847
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,328

to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of standards and there's</font>

866
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:46,910
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good book here by Paul Taylor</font>

867
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:49,910
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of old but he used a</font>

868
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:52,129
sociologist he interviewed people in the

869
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:54,490
computer underground any interview

870
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:57,710
people in law enforcement and the

871
00:39:54,490 --> 00:40:00,140
mitigation communities and compared and

872
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:02,030
contrasted how do they function how do

873
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">they communicate how do they cooperate</font>

874
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:06,290
how do they vet somebody into the group

875
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,509
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> their requirements for</font>

876
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,740
membership and there's a huge difference

877
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,090
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that the underground</font>

878
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,129
functions and the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we function</font>

879
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,540
and I see a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people saying well</font>

880
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:17,750
the bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have ethics they</font>

881
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,820
don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't pay laws all those</font>

882
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:24,710
things slow us down they make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder</font>

883
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:26,450
for us to do our job well right because

884
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">we adhere to laws we have ethics and</font>

885
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,200
norms we need to do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit harder</font>

886
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:32,930
job if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do things</font>

887
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:36,160
not just cut corners and make it easier

888
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">to act the way that they're acting</font>

889
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:55,210
so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware that yes it costs</font>

890
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:58,000
us a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a good defensive job</font>

891
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,380
they only have to be right once in some

892
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,770
simple way to get in we have to do a

893
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things but it's really</font>

894
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:07,780
not as cheap and simple as a lot of

895
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">people say to go strike back because</font>

896
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,310
we've spent all that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend on the</font>

897
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:15,939
passive defense that's not working now

898
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:17,740
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go active if you're making a</font>

899
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,480
shortcut and saying I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to strike</font>

900
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,759
back because that's the cheap and easy

901
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:30,730
thing to do that's when we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

902
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:36,370
start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trouble so I think</font>

903
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:37,450
that's probably good if there's time for

904
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,190
any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some questions</font>

905
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:42,189
I'll be hanging around having beers

906
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:43,600
tonight and i will put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides and a</font>
