31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,559
middle of anything and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're</font>

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of isolated out here but the hotel</font>

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,380
and our sponsors have done a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great job</font>

34
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,630
of making sure that not only do we get

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,850
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see Chandler but we also get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

36
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,339
Tempe in phoenix and and wherever else

37
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,809
you'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so keep your eye on the</font>

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,320
agenda will make announcements about

39
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,340
socials that are on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> off site and</font>

40
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,548
there'll be more information about the

41
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,070
shuttle buses that can take you downtown

42
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:13,170
so regarding our<font color="#CCCCCC"> attendance we're at a</font>

43
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,930
record level it's highly likely we'll

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,269
hit 700 attendees here which is a crazy

45
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,670
number the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you were anywhere</font>

46
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,940
close to this number was in net it was

47
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,179
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oakland in 2001 so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that gives you</font>

48
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,890
any idea where almost 13 years off from

49
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,150
hitting an attendance number this high

50
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,069
I will say it definitely took a lot of

51
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,650
us by surprise but we're all glad you're

52
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,450
here so this meeting brings a few

53
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes that we've discussed over the</font>

60

278
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,229
quality of the program or the quality of

00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:55,779
the structure of nanog that they

282
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:02,740
unique to nanog in as the executive

283
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,980
director who puts together these

284
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,800
