00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:19,160
okay there might be okay hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,229
thanks for coming my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris</font>

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,340
woodfield I'm with Twitter the network

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,840
engineering team so just just a quick

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,020
informal show of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands how many of the</font>

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,280
people at right here work with load

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:38,930
balancers at wanna do on a regular basis

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good number so follow up for those</font>

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,500
of you who haven't raised your hands how

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,060
many of you have them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:50,930
infrastructure but they're not managed

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:52,280
by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network engineering team okay of</font>

13
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,230
those of you who haven't raised your

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,070
hands yet how many of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't worry I</font>

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,968
got a script for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you raise</font>

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:05,089
your hand I might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you</font>

17
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:08,570
afterwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so so again</font>

18
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:11,149
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for coming and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're here</font>

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:16,130
to discuss fundamentally ways in which

20
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:18,200
we can as network engineers at this at

21
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:23,270
this level of the stack can help our

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:26,390
customers appscale by either offloading

23
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:28,548
or allowing for you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,520
that I've it allows for wide wide

25
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:35,780
horizontal scaling and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,229
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> or out from there so a couple q</font>

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:42,560
questions of when we when we think about

28
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,658
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem space um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a pretty</font>

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,439
wide way of right wide array of

30
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,240
strategies options and with that come

31
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,350
what that comes with that is that you

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,000
know you do get a lot of customer

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,439
confusion and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people when</font>

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,770
they're first going into this first

37
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,750
know do I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do layer seven layer</font>

38
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,508
four and we'll go over the various

39
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,549
options but you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font>

40
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:10,459
big you're going to be in two years or

41
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,930
three years and you're terrified and

42
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:15,070
making the wrong choice now because you

43
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,510
might have to undo it light later

44
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,668
because you know what what what worked

45
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,840
when you were getting you know a

46
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:24,319
thousand page views an hour won't work

47

when you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> millions obviously</font>

that said you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

49
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,190
the large-scale solutions just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

50
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,739
make sense at lower scales either so you

51
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,599
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out a transition plan and</font>

52
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,650
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start small and at</font>

53
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,920
what point are going to start getting

54
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,730
larger and grow and grow and change

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,379
strategies as as your application

approaches internet scale the slide deck

57
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:53,129
is buzzword compliant so there's a so as

58
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,670
a few base options and in the current

65
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,518
more and more software come into the

that as the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> options you do</font>

94
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,130
have a number of basic styles you've got

95
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,860
you got your the application proxy style

96
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:44,940
and then you have a couple NAT based

97
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,510
solutions and we'll go over these one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,250
the time just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a as a refresher so</font>

layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 load balancing is a set is</font>

100
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,630
essentially you're running an

101
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,040
application proxy not ninety percent of

102
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,820

00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:05,280
SMTP I've seen my sequel I've seen DNS

105
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,560
you know any layers have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application</font>

106
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,619
that you know you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

107
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,740
receives the connections and then takes

<font color="#CCCCCC">that payload and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then forwards that</font>

forwards that query on to a server farm

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,940
if you want to do ssl offload if you

111
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,670
want to centralize that and take take

most dear open source solutions live as

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,030
well and if you're using a CDN you're

121
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:53,030
already doing this just a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific</font>

running as a as a gnat TCP UDP route or

127
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,900
a connection based router here your box

128
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,990
isn't doing nearly as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it is</font>

130
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,420
application intelligence so there's an

at your trade off less resources sense

132
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,130

your own ssl we can also do a trick

134
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:32,610
called direct server return which some

135
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:36,780
some people are know about but just as a

136
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:38,760
refresher this basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows for the</font>

137
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">server that receives the connection</font>

138
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,130
after it receives after it gets forward

139
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,770
from the load balancer to reply to the

140
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,930
client directly it effectively spoofs

141
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,849
the source IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the original VIP</font>

142
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,360
sends a response directly which bypasses

143
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,160
the lb and in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients server</font>

144
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,620
traffic flows where most your traffic is

145
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,190
server to client that saves a lot of

146
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,199
resources the trade-off<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you're</font>

147
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">not running your low balance or doesn't</font>

148
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,680
get to see both sides the connection

149
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,350
which can bring some other issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

150
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,090
well again almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> every most of the</font>

151
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,199
solutions are going to get are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going but</font>

152
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,349
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the vendor solutions out there</font>

153
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,870
offer this<font color="#E5E5E5"> DSR implementations varying</font>

154
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:25,259
the details I found and this is also

155
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:29,009
where LDS plays well now once you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

156
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,570
the point that you've got a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> VIP</font>

157
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:32,130
you know at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point you're going to</font>

158
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,449
have to spread out sideways<font color="#CCCCCC"> too you're</font>

159
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,330
going to have multiple endpoints for

160
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">your service again a whole bunch of</font>

161
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">different options where do you even</font>

162
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,030
start to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it dns base is</font>

163
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,330
usually where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> start with that's</font>

164
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:47,210
that's the most obvious and easiest to

165
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,710
implement but you have to bring in

166
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,960
failover situations which means you

167
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,109
can't just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to have</font>

168
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,849
something actively managing your the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPS</font>

169
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,150
you hand out<font color="#CCCCCC"> in response to failures</font>

170
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:01,650
geolocation comes in here other

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,049
solutions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have is active active</font>

172
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,840
a che or clustering where you can have

173
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,699
stripe your multiple VIPs or even the

174
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">same VIP across multiple members of a</font>

175
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:15,630
high availability cluster I've seen ecmp

176
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:19,440
balancing where you take a single IP and

177
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:23,009
depend on upstream routers doing flow

178
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,810
hashing to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the packets for us</font>

179
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:27,810
for a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP connection to the</font>

180
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:31,380
same box that can then farm it out to

181
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,789
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same server and then you have seen</font>

182
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">people do this with any cast well where</font>

183
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,620
they put usually you see this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,510
but I am seeing people doing this with

185
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,140
TCP with varying levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> of success as</font>

186
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:47,250
well and all of these solutions failover

187
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,110
differently there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

188
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,279
vendor-supplied solutions and again open

189
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,220
source solutions out there in the field

190
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,839
for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and basically when you</font>

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,060
pick your mileage may vary so we'll be

224
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,960
to our discussion questions and you know

225
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,730
let's start with the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> one which</font>

226
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:40,560
I'll paraphrase a lot of a lot of what

227
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,340
what you do at the lb layer really does

228
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,680
depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application and in what</font>

229
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,060
ways that in what ways do your

230
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,900
application and also your network

231
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,270
designs inform and influence your load

232
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,150
balancer designs architecture and

233
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:59,550
scaling strategies at that point where

234
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:03,720
can this help you and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the risks</font>

235
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:05,640
are rewards so the style I think well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

236
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we can just start with going from</font>

237
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,330
left to right for each of the questions

238
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,819
and you know feel free to go back and

239
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">forth if you like from there so we'll</font>

240
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,860
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Mike</font>

241
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,630
I think it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application</font>

242
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,460
ultimately you know these these

243
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,200
technologies are really there<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

244
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,630
they're solving business problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

245
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,310
allowing consumers to to access

246
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,620
resources in a way that actually makes

247
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:30,319
sense and so I think when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to</font>

248
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,190
design I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> any any methodology that</font>

249
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,990
is based on a religious viewpoint

250
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,350
inherently misses the point that it's

251
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,930
all about efficiency optimization and

252
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,460
really so the second portion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

253
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:46,250
question is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> risk-reward</font>

254
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:49,040
insert environments such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo and</font>

255
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,410
Twitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Facebook and other large</font>

256
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,230
environments those have different needs

257
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,089
then let's say that the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> 99 percent</font>

258
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,370
of the infrastructure is out there and

259
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:01,400
so based off of what actually makes

260
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,860
sense should should really be the

261
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,670
approach whether it's ecmp gsl be just

262
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:14,120
you know whatever whatever systems you

263
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:15,680
feel appropriate um for what we do at

264
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,800
Yahoo obviously we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with a</font>

265
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,300
lot of scale a lot of high volume but it

266
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,339
actually gives us an opportunity to work

267
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,500
with the application owners engineers

268
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,560
and architects to really get an

269
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,340
understanding of what they need

270
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,560
obviously when you are dealing with

271
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">large-scale high traffic you know keep</font>

272
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,719
it simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> stupid is the preferred method</font>

273
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,680
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't always work sometimes you</font>

274
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,620
really do have to kind of think outside

275
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:44,900
the box so that it just really gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

276
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,430
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> network engineer you really have to</font>

277
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,069
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to kind of go both ways for both</font>

278
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,540
systems and networking to really be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

279
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up at the right solution for</font>

280
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:58,219
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> cus for your end users and your</font>

281
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:01,040
customers um so I find really

282
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:05,540
interesting is one do you decide to do

283
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:09,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">DSR and layer 2 versus layer 3 DSR as</font>

284
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:15,260
many of us know yahoo has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge in a</font>

285
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,850
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating layer 3 DSR so your</font>

286
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,730
network design is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really important if</font>

287
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,490
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as shown like facebook</font>

288
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:25,070
yesterday everyone saw was running each

289
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,410

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:32,050

292
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,319
because you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have your load</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't want to necessarily have to</font>

297
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,138
layer 3 DSR then creates a lot more

298
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:49,660
complexity at your router level because

299
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:52,230
you have to be looking at qos bits or

300
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:56,920
however else you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be marking</font>

301
00:13:52,230 --> 00:14:01,350
your VIPs so I find that very

302
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,269
interesting as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DSR versus non</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DSR</font>

303
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:08,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">dsr has some advantages such as you get</font>

304
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:12,100
to you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spoof your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> source</font>

305
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,399

306
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,769
headers for example x-forwarded-for is

307
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:22,269
very common when you're doing HTTP load

308
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:25,959
balancing and yeah it depends on what

309
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:28,779
your needs are as well for scaling DSR

310
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:32,079
allows you to use a much less powerful

311
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:34,060
load balancer for the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic</font>

312
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,670
you have especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a very</font>

313
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,569
heavy outbound application like most of

314
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,569
us content providers

315
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,590
I think load balancers have a unique

316
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,170
it's it's a unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of network</font>

317
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:51,660
service where it needs both deep

318
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,219
intelligence of the network as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as</font>

319
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,900
deep intelligence in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application</font>

320
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,910
it's probably one of those rare network

321
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,490
services that that needs to be embedded

322
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,370
deeply into both these realms so it

323
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:05,940
comes as<font color="#CCCCCC"> no surprise when we think about</font>

324
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,680
how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it's influenced by both the</font>

325
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,260
application stack as well as changes in

326
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,359
network design so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance as we</font>

327
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,130
think about the newer ways of

328
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,960
architecting applications there there

329
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,340
are emerging technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

330
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,080
architecture such as service-oriented

331
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,210
architectures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually disaggregate</font>

332
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,770
and component eyes application stack

333
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">into distinct components that can run</font>

334
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,720
separately and take advantage of each

335
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,540
other's availability and functionality

336
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,010
so that would directly influence the

337
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,870
architecture for<font color="#E5E5E5"> load balancing because</font>

338
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,430
now the application is built in a

339
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,380
distributed model that put sort of

340
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">influence a distributed model for the</font>

341
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,700
load balancing also because remember

342
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,440
load balancing is actually closely

343
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,480
follows the applications availability

344
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,720
characteristics basically from a network

345
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,070
standpoint most recent trend has been

346
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this classic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three-tier</font>

347
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,980
architectures which consisted of<font color="#CCCCCC"> axis</font>

348
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,170
aggregation and core layers in the

354
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,050
opposed to north south so these changes

355
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,670
in these changes in the network actually

356
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,589
has a direct impact on where the load

357
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,420
balancer is placed first of all and then

358
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,490
you have opportunities to consolidate

359
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,050
can you place them in a centralized

360
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,750
location so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's equally accessible</font>

from every place in the data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

362
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,110
then that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> directly impacts out of</font>

the scaling strategies that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

and as vendors we need to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

customer environments

376
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:59,010
um I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would also like to talk</font>

377
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,140
about scaling up versus scaling out

378
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,390
that's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big question right</font>

379
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,980
you've you've outgrown your first your

380
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,530
first you know pair of load balancers

381
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:12,209
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do do you do buy a larger</font>

382
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:14,369
box or do you buy multiple and for us

383
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,850
our solution is we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get multiple and</font>

384
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:20,069
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is for some people how</font>

385
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:23,129
are you going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to load balance you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:55,590
and we solely bgp pier with our with our

on an army of developers to roll your

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,900
open source implementation the question

427
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,420
is how much is it actually going to save

428
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,370
you over time because as if you go and

429

look on red red hat site<font color="#CCCCCC"> freeze them</font>

market the competitiveness of what's

432

happening definitely makes it a very

433
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,700
interesting thing now around scaling I

434
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,460
think there's obviously multiple

435
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,500
strategies I think the the most

436
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,270
important thing really fundamental

437
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,880
question at least within the data center

438
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:41,250
is do you want application delivery

439
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,620
services or do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> load balancing</font>

440
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,650
services that inherently is going to

441
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,090
directly influence your architecture

442
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:56,250
greater<font color="#E5E5E5"> than really a lot of other other</font>

443
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:57,870
decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so second the second</font>

444
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,280
follow-up question that I'll have then

445
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,790
give of each of the panelists and time

446
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,910
to respond to is what app services do

447
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:07,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect to be delivered by at this</font>

448
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:11,160
application load about application

449
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,190
delivery / load balancing layer versus

450
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,400
what is generally depending on the

451
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:18,960
environment you're in like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

452
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,780
of things like you know when does it

453
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,490
make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offload ssl versus</font>

454
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,490
handling it when does it make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to</font>

455
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:29,100
do you know connection coalescing at

456
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,380
that layer and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of different</font>

457
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">components of delivering delivering a</font>

458
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,929
complete service to the user will start

459
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,260
from the actual let's start from you

460
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,260
this time

461
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,420
as we think about this question I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

462
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,340
it's important for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind</font>

00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,990

466
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,300
but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the application run faster</font>

467
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,430
more secure and more scalable and

468
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,110
ultimately provide a better end-user

469
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,820
experience that's that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

470
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,550

474
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,970
would actually allow the server to not

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,980
focus on TCP connection establishment

476
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,840
and teardown but rather focus on what

477
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,490
it's meant to do sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of focus on the</font>

478
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,439
core business logic instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of worrying</font>

479
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,110
about a whole bunch of other things like

480
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,260
SSL crypto a floor or<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP multiplexing</font>

481
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:32,100
or content optimization like caching and

482
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:34,080

syn flood attacks can be easily thought

it'd buy buy buy the<font color="#CCCCCC"> adcs for instance</font>

494
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,780
question of out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all these services</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for your application as you design your</font>

496
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,160
application what is the subset that you

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,350
think is appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would love</font>

498
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:14,520
your application to focus on what it's

499
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:16,679
designed for and let the ADC offload as

500
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,510
much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible from the application in</font>

501
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,180
terms of what i call the overhead around

502
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:24,710
connection processing and even to some

503
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,710
extent crypto processing so

504
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,669
well I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak specifically</font>

505
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:33,409
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i find that ssl</font>

506
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,850
tends to be the most common thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

507
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:38,270
people off load onto their load

508
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:40,459
balancers and most of us here providing

509
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:45,260
a web service so you have your normal

510
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:48,770
HTTP versus https for the most part<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

511
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:51,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a net-positive to remove</font>

512
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">your SSL decryption from your load</font>

514
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,600
balancer is a really stupid layer for

515
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,730
just forwarding based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP we</font>

516
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,860
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an engine X cluster that</font>

517
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:08,540
all it does is the SSL decryption and

518
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:11,000
it's very efficient at that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> downside</font>

519
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:14,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that then you do add some more</font>

520
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,340
complexity to your system level you have

521
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,650
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create another cluster of a type of a</font>

522
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,909
machine and for some people they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

523
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,220
all of their web servers to be

524
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,710
completely identical and in this case

525
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,250
you obviously you you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all of</font>

526
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:31,430
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> web servers doing SSL decryption</font>

527
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:33,770
based on the number of SSL versus non

528
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:36,530
SSL that may wind up having a very

529
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,660
inefficient distribution and so just

530
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,610
randomly some of your web servers may be

531
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:45,170
doing a lot more a lot more work<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

532
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:48,010
others and so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can't add some</font>

533
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:50,000
complexity but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the fact that</font>

534
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,800
once it gets once again it comes down to

535
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,060
cost you're spending<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of money on</font>

536
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:59,000
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> fancy load balancers and the more</font>

537
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:03,139
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do on them the less connections per</font>

538
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,220
second you can run on them one thing I

539
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,680
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just want to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

540
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,180
you you touched on all you touching the

541
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,640
fact that you have an elf or layer and

542
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,160
then you have an l7 layer behind that I

543
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,550
mean that multi-tier approaches are

544
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:20,680
perfectly valid and we we can I see that

545
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot so thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for bringing that up</font>

546
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,520
well I saying you know what application

<font color="#E5E5E5">however</font>

554
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:43,460
I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep it the complexity</font>

555
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,830
down as much as possible so that i can

individual solutions for each individual

00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:54,080
customer reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is though is I have</font>

specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers inside of Yahoo who</font>

561

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,580
for syn flood protection because they

563
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,279
see four or five send floods a week that

564
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,379
definitely influences which box<font color="#E5E5E5"> i buy</font>

565
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:07,880
there are occasionally going to be you

566
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,909
know some properties who would like us

567
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,120
to do SSL offload but it comes back to

568
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:15,230
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what Leslie was saying that um</font>

569
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,699
yeah at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some point when you start</font>

570
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,919
turning on all the little knobs and

571
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,169
whistles and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bells you really do cut</font>

572
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:25,220
into your available capacity and if you

are a high volume capacity driven<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

strategy if we play a lot with the you

know l4 at the front l7 at the back and

579
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that actually does make a large</font>

580
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:43,158
difference on how much more capacity we

581
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,350
can deliver because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know obviously</font>

582
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:51,830
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 810 5000's is a lot more</font>

583
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:57,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">expensive than for a 10-3 thousands and</font>

584
00:25:51,830 --> 00:26:01,490
a couple of servers doing l7 so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

585
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:03,559
a whole can of worms right here so so

586
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,510
atcs are like Swiss Army knives right so

587
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,820
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need DDoS protection or you need</font>

588
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">wife or you need application offload</font>

589
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,110
really think of ADC services as really a

590
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:14,630
extension of your application<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

591
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure and there's a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

592
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,870
points here one of them if you guys go

593
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">out on your laptops and go out to</font>

594
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:24,439
verisign or<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantic or any of the major</font>

595
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:27,110
SSL vendors and you say i want a premium

596
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,419
ssl certificate for a hundred systems

597
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,979
and you follow their legal agreement

598
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:32,750
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have with them you're looking</font>

599
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,640
at about 1.5 million dollars have a

600
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:38,419
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers with with with</font>

601
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,590
legitimate ssl certificates on board so

602
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:41,510
if you turn around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say all right</font>

603
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">well even just for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl offload from a</font>

604
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,230
business perspective starts making sense

605
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:47,690
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> specially if you start having lots</font>

606
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,789
of lots of a capital<font color="#CCCCCC"> expenditure around</font>

607
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,389
certificates so let's remove the

00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:53,369
business side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the equation of y</font>

thing mask deficiencies in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

618
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,468
that is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> written by developers you</font>

619
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:19,079
develop these the developers inherently

620
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:20,519
don't think about security or think

621
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,129
about specific functionality in a

622
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,959
holistic manner and as a result when it

623
00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:28,049
comes to deploy guess what you have to

624
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:30,479
virtually patch your application the way

625
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:32,579
you virtually patch them you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in</font>

626
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:34,589
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through a flex or through some</font>

00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:37,349
specific thing you look at someone who's

628
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:38,969
doing memcache in no way I can't do

629
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:40,829
memcache on the server because I'm also

630
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:42,419
doing some other sorts of caching so how

631
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:44,428
do you fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you didn't budget</font>

632
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,279
for it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a TCS are very powerful and</font>

637
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:59,479
day we're only out of business if and I

638
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:02,070
say this we're only out of business if

639
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:04,649
if we choose not to continue to innovate

640
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:06,599
our platforms and provide value right

641
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:08,820
and that basically means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we remain</font>

about providing those additional

664
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,250
that provide for a complete

665
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:17,100
administrative partitioning of the

666
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:19,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">hardware or software system you know you</font>

667
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,959
know permissions based where you know

668
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:24,629
user a can edit his VIPs where user<font color="#E5E5E5"> B</font>

669
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,520
and it is and either either within a

00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,650
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> system or with virtualized</font>

virtualized images running on a shared

672
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:34,500
shared hardware infrastructure so with

673
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:37,650
that framing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll start from from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">send again on this one yes multi</font>

675
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,880
tendency is kind of an interesting topic

676
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,580
because again there's three things

677
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,920
implied one of them is a separation of

678
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,320
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different data classification</font>

679
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,150
or security zones<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a density</font>

680
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,520
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> in most multi-tenant environment</font>

681
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:56,310
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to think about</font>

682
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,430
the services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really the model of</font>

683
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:01,500
the multi tendency is isolated at the OS

684
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:04,020
level is isolated in a virtualized

685
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,760
container within a given environment I

686
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,740
think one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

687
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry as a whole they ADC industry as</font>

688
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,490
a whole is done is actually produced you

689
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">know some some pretty good stories</font>

690
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:17,160
around multi-tenancy whether it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Citrix</font>

691
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:21,270
with the sdx whether it's our platform

692
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:24,900
with l3v and RV<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thunder series or it's</font>

693
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:27,060
you know f5 with their vc + p<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

694
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,710
one thing has definitely come out of the

695
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,810
industry is that we understand the

696
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,430
multi-tenant problem and realize that to

697
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:35,340
some of these points<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

698
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">commingle traffic to save</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money and i</font>

699
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,340
think if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at scaling</font>

700
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,740
unfortunately we are dealing with finite

701
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,678
compute

702
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:44,140
machines you you know the benefit of our

703
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,140
methodologies is that we optimize our

704
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:50,010
code more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a stat a</font>

705
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,360
standard install that you would roll and

706
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,950
so the interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when you</font>

707
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,678
start dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiply tendency you</font>

708
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually and you start packing more</font>

709
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,510
users into a space<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they start</font>

710
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,880
consuming more services you end up

711
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:06,100
dealing with scaling issues at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

712
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,840
end right most scaling problems don't

713
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,389
really actually start emerging until

714
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,059
you're you know in that eighty percent

715
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:16,740
range and so one of the things I've been

716
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:20,740
seeing is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fan-out methodologies</font>

717
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:23,830
and really actually looking at where

718
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,980
multi-tenancy should actually occur it's

719
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,389
for the most part in the places<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

720
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,630
you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large aggregation of</font>

721
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,820
traffic at this point so you can have

722
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,410

<font color="#CCCCCC">make this a vendor specific thing but</font>

00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,220
you know we have a win you platform 160

you know you may you may not necessarily

729
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,149
achieve it because it is a finite

computing machine with that said I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

731
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:54,400
multi-tenancy and density are definitely

732
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:55,720
driving factors because again Intel's

733
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,290
producing the chips they can only do so

734
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:05,260
much and as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do have scaling</font>

735
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:06,879

00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,559
gather the necessary stats that maybe

748
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,360
AWS or Rackspace doesn't want to expose

749
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,360
to me because they ultimately on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

750
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,939

751
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,010
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that is a great value</font>

753
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:53,230
to be honest it doesn't really apply to

754
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:55,720
us if if we need a more partitioning we

755
00:32:53,230 --> 00:33:02,500
just sort of scale out and add another

756
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:05,740
pair of of load balancers that was a

757
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,470
quick pass so yeah I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more</font>

758
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:11,380
time I guess so as we think about

759
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:14,230
multi-tenancy multi-tenancy is a way to

760
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:16,300
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> more with less resources in a very</font>

761
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:19,300
simplified definition would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

762
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:22,270
it's a way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid sprawl it's a way to</font>

763
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:24,250
avoid sprawl of underutilized<font color="#CCCCCC"> ADCs</font>

764
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:26,530
across your data centers but if you

765
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> costs the sprawl in the</font>

766
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,830
first place it's actually going back to

767
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,300
an earlier statement it actually comes

768
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,460
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization being the</font>

you consolidate your appliances into as

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Advent for multi-tenancy</font>

needs to face certain challenges their

they're running on on shared hardware

00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,320
that's an important question to address

00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,460
we have to invest deeply in technology

to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of isolation and in performance</font>

794
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,360
but also in terms of opera

<font color="#CCCCCC">operationalization do you have the right</font>

their load balancer as a service

00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:40,300
independently without impacting another

799
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,969
pennant so the operational aspects are

800
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,740
very key and and to that extent actually

801
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:47,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's networking especially has stood</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

802
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:48,939
the way for true multi-tenancy and

803
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:52,690
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> because networks were built</font>

804
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:54,639
as monolithic structures that are there

805
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,830
a single tenant that's that's why we see

806
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,210
the emergence of of technologies like

807
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">software-defined networking we're</font>

essentially

809
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,660
it's it's it it's completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

810
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:06,220
centralized control plane but it offers

811
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,600
for multiple tenants to control the

812
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,600
network as though they have their own

813
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,940
dedicated network and so follows network

814
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,759
services so from an ADC standpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

815
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:18,490
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important aspect and and</font>

816
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,820
like Mike pointed out the all the

multiple approaches towards solving this

00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:38,470
problem which is top of mind for most

customers that we speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to okay so our</font>

final our final discussion topic I'm

823
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:48,490
let's talk about the point at which you

00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:51,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be at what point do you have to</font>

825
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:52,629
be automating and how extensive should

826
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,940
you know do you do you does your

827
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,130
automation need to be as your app as

828
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:00,609
your app and as your installation begins

829
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:07,390
to scale up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

830
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:09,160
this one let's start um at what point do

831
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:12,069
you need to be automating actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

832
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,750
think i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones who've actually</font>

833
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,100
gone through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process of automation</font>

834
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,020
automating the data centers<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have a</font>

835
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,359
better perspective but from but from a

836
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:22,390
technology vendor standpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially</font>

837
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:25,180
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would think that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

838
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">automate the moment you see yourself</font>

839
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,680
doing repetitive tasks more than once or

840
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,840
twice and the need for automation exists

841
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,799
in the in the advantages to be gained

842
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:38,050
from motivation was clear hopefully to

843
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,090
to most operators the problem however is

844
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the complexity in automating and that</font>

845
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,740
results from the lack of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

846
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:47,230
uniform API set across different

847
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,149
different vendors in the same space

848
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:52,420
networking does not have a uniform API

849
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:54,369
said like security services do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have</font>

850
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,869
a uniform API said a DC's don't have a

851
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:58,270
uniform API said each of us have a

852
00:36:55,869 --> 00:37:00,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">comprehensive set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of AP is that the</font>

853
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,290
customer can use to automate but<font color="#CCCCCC"> no it</font>

854
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,118
the same set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP ice cannot be used</font>

855
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,279
across different products and that's

856
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,200
that's a problem now the large vendors

857
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,710
obviously have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wherewithal to kind</font>

858
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,960
of kind of surmount that problem and

859
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:15,690
actually in

degree where it actually results in

862
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,460
operational efficiencies for them so

863
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,670
automation is built into their design

from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> get-go however the downstairs</font>

it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to justify that against the</font>

869
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,700
benefits in in running your operations

870
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,109
basically that's changing now especially

871
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">because of the advent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

872
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:42,000
standardized orchestration platforms

873
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,380
there that are actually custom-built not

874
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,390
just for the cloud providers but also

875
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,000
for more for enterprise in a prices also

876
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,490
as that changes and it becomes more

877
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,369
embraceable by a broader a broader

878
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,899
segment I think you will actually all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

879
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:57,330
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> would see that more and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more data</font>

880
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:02,460
center operations are actually automated

881
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:05,910
moving forward so especially for smaller

882
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,800
providers I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that automation when</font>

883
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,618
to automate can be a bigger deal if you

884
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if your google or facebook you can</font>

885
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,430
have an entire team that all they're

886
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,190
doing is automation<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know when</font>

887
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,529
it's when it's just me running things it

888
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:23,040
can be difficult a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times vendor</font>

889
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:26,640
api's don't do what they claim we've all

890
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,400
experienced that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really lucky</font>

891
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,319
right now that since we're using a

892
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,710
completely linux based solution we're

893
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:37,400
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a linux based solution to</font>

894
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:41,070
automate it we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to use puppet</font>

895
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:45,000
whenever we have to add in new new

896
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:47,730
servers which makes makes all of our

897
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,470
configuration much more simple you

898
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:52,470
actually even can see it online if you

899
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:55,439
just Google for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wikimedia operations</font>

900
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:58,560
puppet and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a repository is</font>

901
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,950
on github yeah so that makes it a lot

902
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,779
easier um of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you know if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

903
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,580
you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple vendors you</font>

904
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,880
have to write an entire abstraction

905
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:11,819
layer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one when you find</font>

906
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,080
yourself doing something for more<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font>

907
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,060
of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> than it would take for you to</font>

908
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,950
automate it that's when it's time to

909
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,420
automate it even when you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

910
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:21,689
may see yourself doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

911
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,330
future because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does wind up saving</font>

912
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:26,109
you time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end even if you if you</font>

913
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:29,470
start if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you delay</font>

914
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:31,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're your initial deployment a little</font>

915
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:38,200
bit in order to get the automation ready

916
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:40,119
in before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just like to</font>

917
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,098
say that I personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy the concept</font>

918
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,529
of copying and pasting bad configuration

919
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:47,799
and network devices it gives me job

920
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:48,880
security no seriously as<font color="#CCCCCC"> um as soon as</font>

921
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:50,559
you know that you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

922
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,739
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> at scale even if it's not at</font>

923
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:57,759
scale just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to introduce</font>

924
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:59,440
that human error element so um you know

925
00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:01,269
obviously for people like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Leslie's</font>

926
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,549
boat it is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a challenge but you</font>

927
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:05,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">know sometimes maybe you say you know</font>

928
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:07,359
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a month longer to do</font>

929
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,460
this correct and obviously in the

930
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,019
OpenStack movement you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're</font>

931
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,759
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build those abstraction layers</font>

932
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:16,209
through originally through Atlas now

933
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:18,039
through grizzly you know but for the

934
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,799
vendors who actually are making<font color="#E5E5E5"> API is</font>

935
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:22,269
available to us you know we have people

936
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:24,369
internally who are writing that

937
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:26,109
abstraction layer for us so that we can

938
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:28,180
take our already existing automation

939
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:30,098
tools that are using some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

940
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,480
antiquated solutions for pushing configs

941
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:34,450
to load balancers to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font>

942
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">a much faster delivery and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

943
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:39,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually what you accomplish with</font>

944
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:42,339
automation is a speedier delivery time

945
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:43,809
to deliver for your end users so yeah

946
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:45,839
you know kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of going back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when i</font>

947
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:48,460
route my original comment you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

948
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">automation is key as soon as you think</font>

949
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,839
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer anything to your</font>

950
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,819
end users and obviously it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

951
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:56,319
successful for us I would actually

952
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,808
really like to second the fact that

953
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,630
automation even if it doesn't

954
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:04,539
necessarily save you a lot of time the

955
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:09,700
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to troubleshoot human error</font>

956
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:12,430
will save you a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time yeah you</font>

957
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:15,118
know I am an automation junkie you know

958
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:17,649
I I think that automation is actually

959
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,039
what all engineering team should be

960
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:23,950
striving for you know if you really look

961
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:26,859
at automation one of the problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

962
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:28,839
automation doesn't occur is because the

963
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:31,420
folks that actually understand what

964
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:33,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're doing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what mundane tasks are</font>

965
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,950
doing daily they don't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

966
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:38,289
to go about automating I think that's

967
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,649
that's one problem so platforms like you

968
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:42,080
know puppet or chef are actually

969
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,910
allowing those this<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams to actually</font>

970
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,440
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut and paste and be able take</font>

971
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,990
configurations they normally would be

972
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,000
doing from a CLI perspective and able to

973
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,620
automate that now one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

974
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,280
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say though around automation is</font>

975
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,690
that and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I i love OpenStack and so</font>

976
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,160
for those out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there who are kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

977
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:00,500
religious on the OpenStack movement I

978
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,740
apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> but one of the inherent issues</font>

979
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:06,860
with things like lb as a service at

980
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:09,680
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> historically in grizzly or even</font>

981
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:12,890
with the so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quantum plugin</font>

982
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,980
is that it waters down everything to

983
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:18,379
load balancing which why are you going

984
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:21,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to buy a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ADC that just does load</font>

985
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,810
balancing it makes no sense right yeah

986
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,759
you can do spraying pray at high volumes

987
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:28,450
and stuff but for again those those

988
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,000
OpenStack instances or even within the

989
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:33,620
VMware environment or Zen environment if

990
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,180
you can use open source things to

991
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually take care of the basic load</font>

992
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,810
balancing services ends up making more

993
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:40,220
sense now when you start talking about

994
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that scale and additional</font>

995
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,100
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember why i said earlier</font>

996
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,900
you're extending the application onto

997
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,540
the infrastructure and so one of the

998
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,650
strategies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've taken is</font>

999
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,790
especially with like<font color="#CCCCCC"> cabanas saying all</font>

1000
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">right well we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the el</font>

1001
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">bosque</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin specifically for us but</font>

1002
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,129
we're also creating this framework in

1003
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,830
conjunction with that so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1004
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,930
both so that you can actually take

1005
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:02,600
advantage of our specific services or

1006
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,859
vendor specific services so that if we

1007
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,330
do offer something that gives you a

1008
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,190
competitive advantage in markets

1009
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:08,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">available to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think one thing</font>

1010
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:12,430
that ultimately when it comes down to

1011
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:14,600
automation I really think that every

1012
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:17,330
every instance of everything should be

1013
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,759
automated and what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I</font>

1014
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,790
don't think automation in my mind is is

1015
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,170
not about actually going out there and

1016
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:25,820
saying I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this button</font>

1017
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,620
something happens although that is a

1018
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,570
form of automation what I believe

1019
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:32,029
automation is is that the applications

1020
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:33,760
themselves are participating<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

1021
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:37,520
synchronous event driven environment

1022
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,800
that allows for orchestration to occur

1023
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,240
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> such a manner that the applications</font>

1024
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:47,750
themselves know what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need better</font>

1025
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:50,299
than the admins themselves so I just

1026
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:52,130
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add basically today a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1027
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,480
focus of automation is actually is

1028
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,580
around

1029
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,160
deploying new application<font color="#CCCCCC"> services and</font>

1030
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:01,580
associated ADC services around automated

1031
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,250
provisioning of of these services<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1032
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,869
think a glaring gap that that that we

1033
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,690
are aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody is aware of</font>

1034
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:11,210
is that there there is no automated ways

1035
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:13,390
of actually retrieving operational

1036
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:15,920
status or especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

1037
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,140
troubleshooting and monitoring already

1038
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,140
deployed services so that's an area that

1039
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:22,790
as vendors we are very well aware of and

1040
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,520
it's a key area<font color="#CCCCCC"> of focus for us</font>

1041
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:26,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially if you if you integrate into</font>

1042
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,290
our considered environments like

1043
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:31,880
OpenStack or we cloud or cloud platform

1044
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:34,400
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudStack any of these orchestration</font>

1045
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,230
platforms you'd see that the operational

1046
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,670
status and the monitoring aspects

1047
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,500
because when something<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes wrong you</font>

1048
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,460
need quick ways of debugging and that's

1049
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,720
that's that's a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of mind item for</font>

1050
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,910
operators of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data centers right so</font>

1051
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,459
automating that in making that as easy

1052
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:51,680
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible for customers is is a key</font>

1053
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,859
criterion for for all windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

1054
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,859
say

1055
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,379
okay so before we move on to any

1056
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:05,030
audience questions we have a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

1057
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:09,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe make some final general comments</font>

1058
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:12,770
from the panelists going once anyone

1059
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:14,990
anyone yeah so let me just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font>

1060
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:16,700
just say that when it's been a pleasure

1061
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,529
and hopefully if my son is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

1062
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,020
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> us on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube later hi to his</font>

1063

programming class and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else</font>

1064
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:25,970
one of the interesting things that I

1065
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">find about a DC is that you know if I if</font>

1066
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,808
I were to say if any technology was my

1067
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:32,930
mother it would be application<font color="#CCCCCC"> delivery</font>

1068
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:35,180
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I started my career off as a</font>

1069
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,890
network jockey and then got into

1070
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,750
development work got into ethical

1071
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,328
hacking little kernel development<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

1072
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:43,339
patchy development and because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ADC</font>

1073
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:45,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've touched every single technology out</font>

1074
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:46,910
there the reason I'm even bringing this

1075
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:50,000
up is because if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills</font>

1076
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:52,250
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the next generation of</font>

1077
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,690
operators you know kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my son or</font>

1078
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,099
coming up they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

1079
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:56,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">rounded they're not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be single</font>

1080
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:59,720
disciplined and I think one of the

1081
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,549
benefits of this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately</font>

1082
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,578
those those behaviors in a tooling

1083
00:46:01,549 --> 00:46:05,839
associated with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next gen of</font>

1084
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:09,140
infrastructure is going to be driven by

1085
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:12,319
automation and so regardless if it's a

1086
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:14,420
DC or whatever technology the coupling

1087
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:17,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">of application state networking state</font>

1088
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,160
server state and business state because

1089
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,839
ultimately it's about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> execution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1090
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,848
business logic that that's at play here

1091
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:24,589
is all going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be bound together by</font>

1092
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:26,089
automation and if you don't have those

1093
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:27,500
skills by the way in the future then

1094
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:29,000
you're probably going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be left out in</font>

1095
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:35,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dark because a technology is</font>

1096
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:39,859
changing quick um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to say</font>

1097
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:43,240
especially on automation that right now

1098
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:46,880
it is sort of more in its infancy and

1099
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:48,770
you know as network engineers we all

1100
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,539
love to cut and paste and reuse

1101
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:53,059
solutions because it's way easier than

1102
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:55,279
doing your own there<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't a lot right</font>

1103
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:58,160
now especially for the commercial

1104
00:46:55,279 --> 00:47:00,619
platforms but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone is writing these</font>

1105
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,200
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would HIGHLY encourage you to</font>

1123
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:44,060
it's more about elasticity expandability

agility multi-tenancy the metrics to

1155
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:07,730
items on load balancers SNMP is not a

1156
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,710
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way to go we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send strained our</font>

1157
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:11,570
software to behave like a human and log

1158
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:14,570
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ssh prompt and pull data there</font>

1159
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:16,850
but really there's a lack of consistency

1160
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:18,680
and being able to programmatically

1161
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:22,069
extract data from the various<font color="#E5E5E5"> load</font>

1162
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:25,040
balancing vendors and that's been a

1163
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:26,540
bugbear for us so what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in</font>

1164
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,070
the industry to standardize that that

1165
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:30,259
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data extraction to make it</font>

1166
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:33,410
easier for us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually focus on work</font>

1167
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:36,320
flows and not hammering out the ideo

1168
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:38,870
sequences of your dialects and your

1169
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:41,480
platforms yeah so that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1170
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:43,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool question I you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

1171
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,950
the opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of working for like the</font>

1172
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:47,810
three pop three ADC vendors in the

1173
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:50,689
market and I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the evolution of</font>

1174
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:53,810
ADC over time to where you know if you

1175
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:55,820
look at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know nitro API if</font>

1176
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:57,890
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I control API or you</font>

1177
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,690
look at our API they all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

1178
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:01,580
flavors I think one of the things that's

1179
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,920
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now is that there's a</font>

1180
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:06,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">better understanding at least from a</font>

1181
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,150
vendor perspective of how things should

1182
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:10,940
be laid<font color="#CCCCCC"> out right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i think i think</font>

1183
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">projects like like OpenStack and other</font>

1184
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">purist type projects are actually we're</font>

1185
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:17,540
able to extract lessons and

1186
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:19,640
methodologies from from those projects

1187
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,890
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think being able to make sure that</font>

1188
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:25,370
you have a again a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest</font>

1189
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:28,700
implementation around being able to have

00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:30,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">a you know basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> object and then</font>

1191
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">identifier than an object and an</font>

1192
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:35,260
identifier and being able to query in

1193
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:38,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">pull URLs that may give you actual</font>

1194
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:40,730
endpoint resolution that you can again

1195
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,200
recurse through I think those are some

1196
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:43,380
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trends that are happening and I</font>

1197
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,240
think most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

1198
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,130
are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> embracing that because it</font>

1199
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,209
just makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense that's what's going to</font>

1200
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">integrate into other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

1201
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:54,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">environments and I think having to</font>

1202
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:57,450
rewrite code 22 or at least create a new

1203
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">framework or methodology to to highlight</font>

1204
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:01,859
our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know benefits is actually a</font>

1205
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,690
ridiculous notion so to your point there

1206
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:05,190
has been a lot of frustration I think

1207
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:08,130
the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a whole is changing now</font>

1208
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:10,680
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add I just want to add</font>

1209
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:14,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">one more point to that is totally right</font>

1210
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:16,500
that there are there have been API sets

1211
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:18,509
per vendor which are more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or less</font>

1212
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,400
comprehensive everything you want to

1213
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:23,009
automate for a given vendor you would

1214
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:26,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ice for that matter</font>

1215
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:27,480
what doesn't exist is actually a vendor

1216
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:28,829
agnostic set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> API is that you can</font>

1217
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually consumed without worrying about</font>

1218
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:33,089
the underlying platform where those aps

1219
00:51:30,809 --> 00:51:35,130
are actually exercised and clearly there

1220
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:38,130
is the the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> important thing is that</font>

1221
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:40,289
the industry recognizes the need for it

1222
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:42,569
and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that change is happening</font>

1223
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:43,410
with OpenStack or<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudStack or vcloud</font>

1224
00:51:42,569 --> 00:51:46,170
or any of these cloud orchestration

1225
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:48,240
platforms each of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is focused on</font>

1226
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:51,269
building an ecosystem that offers a

1227
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,750
common API set to the tenants or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1228
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:56,490
user basically the the harder problem is

1229
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:59,279
the functions of an ADC especially are

1230
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:01,470
so vast and there there's so much you

1231
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:03,420
can do with that that it's a matter of

1232
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:05,000
priority<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a roadmap as to what we can</font>

1233
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">automate first and then and then</font>

1234
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,480
standardized automation for first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1235
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,190
build the roadmap for one of these cloud

1236
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,190
orchestration platforms OpenStack for

1237
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance today is focused on basic load</font>

1238
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:18,210
balancing functions it hasn't reached a

1239
00:52:15,809 --> 00:52:20,130
point where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy advanced lb</font>

1240
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:22,200
functions or advanced ADC services

1241
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:24,180
through a common set of api's but that's

1242
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,069
the general direction and as vendors

1243
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:28,049
it's it's in our best interest to

1244
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:30,089
actually may accelerate that movement

1245
00:52:28,049 --> 00:52:34,038
and make those services available to the

1246
00:52:30,089 --> 00:52:34,038
user as soon as possible so

1247
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:39,119
so yeah so we're actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

1248
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,319
a similar transition to you we

1249
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,630
ultimately have had to end up writing

1250
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,519
our own abstraction layer finding

1251
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:46,769
commonalities so that my end users can

1252
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:48,390
figure out yay from nay but then

1253
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:51,779
ultimately writing our own subroutines

1254
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:54,598
to support what a 10 versus you know

1255
00:52:51,779 --> 00:52:55,919
citrix may or may not do in the

1256
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:59,339
perspective of how it gets pushed to the

1257
00:52:55,919 --> 00:53:00,989
config but yeah we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing</font>

1258
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:02,219
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar with the ssh expect</font>

1259
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:05,699
method as well for the last few years

1260
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:10,259
and it's very slow and arduous and prone

1261
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:11,699
to errors as well I'll jump in myself on

1262
00:53:10,259 --> 00:53:13,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one because I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually I</font>

1263
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:17,339
actually feel a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same pain</font>

1264
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:19,499
I've in in my environment I got lucky

1265
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:21,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I have a multi-vendor</font>

1266
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:24,209
environment but my two vendors had the

1267
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:27,119
two vendors i had i started with had

1268
00:53:24,209 --> 00:53:29,759
very similar models configuration models

1269
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:32,459
and that worked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my benefit and made</font>

1270
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:34,559
our first round of automation tasks a

1271
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:38,609
lot easier than by all rights<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1272
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:41,809
have been of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course that ended when we</font>

1273
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:44,909
tried to try to expand the vendor breath

1274
00:53:41,809 --> 00:53:48,449
so yeah I know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I know the pain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1275
00:53:44,909 --> 00:53:52,890
which you speak so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

1276
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:56,069
question on my left yeah this is adi

1277
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:58,939
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> University of Michigan so we</font>

1278
00:53:56,069 --> 00:54:04,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> load balancers extensively for HTTP</font>

1279
00:53:58,939 --> 00:54:08,158
primarily and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because the</font>

1280
00:54:04,249 --> 00:54:13,259
the clients of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers and HTTP have</font>

1281
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:15,839
a fundamental<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem which ADC is a try</font>

1282
00:54:13,259 --> 00:54:19,019
to fix and they could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed much more</font>

1283
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:21,419
easily if dns SRV support was added to

1284
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:25,019
browsers now every one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the popular</font>

1285
00:54:21,419 --> 00:54:26,729
browsers has open bugs on adding SRV

1286
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:29,758
support and in some cases they're over

1287
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:31,799
ten years old and if i were a conspiracy

1288
00:54:29,759 --> 00:54:34,079
theorist<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would think that the DC</font>

1289
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:36,630
manufacturers are paying so those bugs

1290
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:39,179
don't get fixed yeah there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fully</font>

1291
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:41,249
conspiracy<font color="#CCCCCC"> van yeah I knew yeah we have</font>

1292
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:43,199
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot we have a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we do</font>

00:54:41,249 --> 00:54:44,908
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely one of them black</font>

1294
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,679
ops movement small bills and briefcases

1295
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:47,250
yeah they're passing him right<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind me</font>

1296
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:50,910
as i speak

1297
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:53,610
so yeah so as much as I would like to

1298
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:56,549
indulge that fantasy unfortunately

1299
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not the case right if you look at</font>

1300
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">ADCs and one of the benefits beyond just</font>

1301
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,940
that that it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> really comes</font>

1302
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:06,330
back down to optimizing the bandwidth

1303
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:08,580
delay products in between the client and

1304
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:10,200
servers right so when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> start talking</font>

1305
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,180
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like full TCB proxies in</font>

1306
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">are all that there's additional benefits</font>

1307
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:17,640
that can actually help optimize the

1308
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:19,260
client-server relationship with that

1309
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,680
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's actually</font>

1310
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">a industry-wide conspiracy I think it's</font>

1311
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:27,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that most people are lazy</font>

1312
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:29,430
and it's not important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know so I</font>

1313
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,959
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggesting that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah there was</font>

1314
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:34,020
I'm just giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a conspiracy yeah</font>

1315
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:38,790
but for most cases you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need all</font>

1316
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:40,920
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> foremost customers for most</font>

1317
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:44,160
industries you probably don't need all

1318
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,440
the ADC bells and whistles<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1319
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,810
in our case the load balancers for

1320
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,720
failover and availability not really for

1321
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:53,940
bandwidth or latency because we're very

1322
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,069
localized<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and you know the hundred</font>

1323
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:59,070
thousand people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who use it are within</font>

1324
00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:01,710
five square months you know so it's it's

1325
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:03,780
not we're forced to pay for features we

1326
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:06,060
don't need and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> force paid for</font>

1327
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:09,030
hardware we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't need if there was DNS</font>

1328
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:10,470
SRV support and so you know what my plea

1329
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:12,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1330
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:16,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">just go to your favorite website web</font>

1331
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,570
browser site and as for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug vote up</font>

1332
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:21,630
that bug to be fixed it's easy fix it

1333
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:27,060
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done in the client and you know</font>

1334
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:29,670
it serves most sites um i would like to

1335
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:34,410
warn them against solely using dns for a

1336
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:37,110
load balancing purpose because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1337
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:39,180
wasn't saying solely<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay clearly hybrid</font>

1338
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:41,400
approaches are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay too but the point is</font>

1339
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:43,140
the low-hanging fruit of SRV records and

1340
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,690
SRV works for lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time</font>

1341
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,400
applications really well so there's no

1342
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:51,450
technical reason it couldn't work for

1343
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:54,690
HTTP or HD NS has no notion of<font color="#CCCCCC"> state and</font>

1344
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:56,879
that's what SRV records address right

1345
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:58,560
the client decides the motion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

1346
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,980
and that's really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you care about is</font>

1347
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,930
whether the client can get

1348
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:04,900
to the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not the client should</font>

1349
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:06,850
be the ultimate arbiter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> state yeah</font>

1350
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,010
and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that initial DNS</font>

1351
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:11,529
request and to identify whether or not a

1352
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:13,570
services available that actually delays

1353
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:15,400
the the first bite of the application

1354
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:19,270
getting to the end user so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately</font>

1355
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,100
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have a DNS lookup yeah but if</font>

1356
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,660
the service isn't available right no you

1357
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,299
still have the DNS lookup and the

1358
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,549
absolute decides right with srvs the

1359
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:30,910
client decides which one is reachable

1360
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:33,100
and you can wait them so it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1361
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:36,910
sip it works for ldap it works for

1362
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:39,670
kerberos it works for lots of other<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font>

1363
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:41,470
and UDP services really well there's no

1364
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:44,950
reason why couldn't work for HTTP and

1365
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:47,069
HTTPS the one one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things for</font>

1366
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:51,939
assuming it's a public-facing

1367
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:55,750
application for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doses are</font>

1368
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:59,140
actually fairly low in number and pretty

1369
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:00,580
stupid honestly and but it's a lot

1370
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them to actually have a</font>

1371
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:06,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">successful attack if each you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know each</font>

1372
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,830
of your your application servers has its

1373
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:12,150
own IP and in any kinetic can partially

1374
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:14,890
deny service by having one tenth of your

1375
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:18,430
servers be offline whereas if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

1376
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:21,520
load balancer it spreads out the wimpy

1377
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:23,589
attacks via a lot of machines where you

1378
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,020
won't even notice it SRV records can

1379
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:28,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">have many many machines in them right</font>

1380
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:32,200
the the load balancers is a scaling

1381
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:34,450
bottleneck right so yeah you can prevent

1382
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,069
d das whisk or you can mitigate the

1383
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:37,180
effects of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adidas with your load</font>

1384
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:40,240
balancer but you have to size it

1385
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:42,069
appropriately to do that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> explore you</font>

1386
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,629
spend your money so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-nine percent</font>

1387
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the time the SRV record will work</font>

1388
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:48,730
fine yeah you're in maybe the top 25 web

1389

a ramp up to getting data exchange and

01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's interesting perhaps for some</font>

that as a way to provide indirection

<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess to the put the question here</font>

01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:38,800
cellular and perhaps reduce the state

1435
01:00:36,609 --> 01:00:40,180
just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of TCP is is there</font>

1436
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,230
anything happening besides what Citrix

1437
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:45,609
is doing or is this interesting to

1438
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:49,089
anybody up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel here today so</font>

1439
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:50,980
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of strategies around around</font>

1440
01:00:49,089 --> 01:00:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the specific topic right if you look at</font>

1441
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">really multi-device load balancing or</font>

1442
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:58,029
being able to cluster services across

1443
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">really ultimately comes back down to</font>

1444
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:03,670
efficiency right if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to constantly</font>

1445
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:06,549
be sharing state and let's say I am you

1446
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:10,690
know greater then let me give you

1447
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:12,849
example if if abc1 and abc2 or service

1448
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:15,400
one or service to is let's say 100

1449
01:01:12,849 --> 01:01:17,650
milliseconds way the client is 20

1450
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,960
milliseconds away can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really share</font>

1451
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:22,180
state across those services and actually

1452
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,070
have that data that information<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1453
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,410
relevant so really these are time-based

1454
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:27,490
problems that when you start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1455
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:29,589
proximity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1456
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:31,990
one host to another the a lot of these

1457
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">things fall down right so with that said</font>

1458
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:36,729
I think that there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> room for</font>

1459
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,890
improvement for tcp actually and I think

1460
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:42,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's room for improvement for a lot</font>

1461
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:43,509
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different areas but actually hit me</font>

1462
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:45,550
up afterwards I'd like to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1463
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:48,250
thoughts on that we're off time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1464
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:49,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so that that's our time thanks</font>

1465
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:53,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody for listening thanks to the</font>

1466
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:56,820
panelists for for speaking with me and

1467
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:56,820
we'll see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> next time on thanks</font>

1468
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,720
you
