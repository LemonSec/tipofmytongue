9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,140
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's at least some people in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">here who are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still interested in best</font>

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:44,890
current operational practices so it's a

12
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,050
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple agenda just a quick</font>

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,150
history first how many people in here

00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:54,750
for the first time never<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to a bc o</font>

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:04,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">so what is a bc o py b CLP this some</font>

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:08,170
this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a challenge over the last</font>

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,420
well frankly 20 ish years we have a

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,790
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with having single repositories</font>

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,460
of definitive useful data for

21
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,960
operational practices you find operator

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,029
groups like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist all over the</font>

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,460
world you get great presentation with

24
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,630
really rich content about all kinds of

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,309
things usually problems and solutions

26
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,460
primarily network related primarily

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:30,549
operator related and as soon as you walk

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,530
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the door that data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> already stale</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all right because you start to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,920
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it how could have you done</font>

31
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,178
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different if your colleagues</font>

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,619
have started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it how could</font>

33

you they have done something different

34
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:42,189
the content isn't really vetted right

35
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,059
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy</font>

36
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:47,199
discussion inside of the room and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,640
you want to find solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these</font>

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,700
problems if you're not in a meeting like

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,649
this you go to either your colleagues or

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,499
maybe pound IX or maybe you read a book

41
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:58,299
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it wiki or even get a good at</font>

42
00:01:56,499 --> 00:02:00,509
good old<font color="#E5E5E5"> wall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll say Google but a</font>

43
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:03,009
qualified search engine to find a

44
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,329
potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution for your you're</font>

45
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:07,179
either problem or what you're trying to

46
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:08,590
implement or perhaps you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

47
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:10,630
your vendors or maybe your customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

48
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,580
going to their vendors and so big city

49
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,960
or big jay says you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

50
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,340
right way to implement something the

51
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,130
best current operational practice for

52
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,630
implementing something using our gear as

53
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,280
we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's a bit challenging and</font>

54
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,579
it's not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best way to do</font>

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,500
things so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right we</font>

56
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,440
have outdated information and accurate

57
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,720
mation the archives are you know in all

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,790
of the operator groups across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the globe</font>

59
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,180
are challenging to search because

60
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:40,750
there's no single repository for it and

61
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:44,620
and this is a the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind a solution</font>

62
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,300
to that problem so the what are these

63
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,920
for these are these are for you right

64
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,000
and these are for your customers these

65
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">are for your colleagues is it for</font>

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,620
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who asks you know someone says</font>

67
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,430
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best way to submit an ipv6</font>

68
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,410
allocation you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead here's a</font>

69
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,000
document a great guideline for you know

70
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:03,910
if that well vetted document and how you

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">should do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so the the audience</font>

72
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,200
is really anybody right there's a mix of

73
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,570
different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people we find that</font>

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,010
you know certainly the idea behind the

75
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,870
documents as they cater to people who

76
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know right they're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for an</font>

77
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they need something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to read is a</font>

78
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,900
single source that is a good place to

79
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,459
start should be a solid document what we

80
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,220
see in these kind of meetings and on

81
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,200
lists are a variety of folks anywhere

82
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,700
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a problem and I'm looking</font>

83
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,238
for someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write a document to solve</font>

84
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:34,660
it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> IMA subject</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter expert in some</font>

85
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,549
area and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm happy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide data or</font>

86
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,670
I'm a good author and I'm happy to write

87
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,220
a document so any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mix of people</font>

88
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,869
anywhere in the arena in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the arena</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

89
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,209
all great for best current operational

90
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,769
practices so if you fit any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of role</font>

91
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,360
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that area we're very happy to have</font>

92
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:56,769
your participation on the list or in

93
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:58,810
these meetings that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so so the</font>

94
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,430
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously we want something</font>

95
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,410
that is an open community driven

96
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottoms-up solution this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all about</font>

97
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,769
community written community vetted<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

98
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,060
we know it's the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> current</font>

99
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,560
operational practice because there's

100
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,640
enough people that participate to say

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,130
yes this is actually the right solution

102
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,810
these need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay current right so</font>

103
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,579
documents that are posted that get

104
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,620
ratified really need to be read on a

105
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,950
regular basis and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is this still the</font>

106
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,390
right thing and you should do this when

107
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,219
you're a subject matter expert in an

108
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,430
area if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you read something you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

109
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,110
please do say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this isn't actually</font>

110
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,970
the best let's have this discussion on

111
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,680
the list and this is why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

112
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,030
let's go

113
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,020
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get it rebooted and</font>

114
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,349
maybe this should change everybody is

115
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,190
absolutely welcome to participate

116
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,500
generally speaking by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way these are</font>

117
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of an 8020 model this is about the</font>

118
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,030
common case we're not looking for

119
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,280
writing documents on side cases or

120
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,020
really weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> one offs that's not useful</font>

121
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the global community that's only</font>

122
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,460
useful for you know very specific

123
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,880
one-off cases there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some documents</font>

124
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,198
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have them noted in sort of the</font>

125
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,729
bottom section<font color="#CCCCCC"> of yet here are some</font>

126
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,430
one-off cases where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably want to</font>

127
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,070
do some other things but generally keep

128
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,060
in mind the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make these fairly</font>

129
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:18,180
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> global common practices not I</font>

130
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:20,310
have this one little tiny edge case that

131
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,080
we should write down although<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

132
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,759
welcome to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

133
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure everybody understands the idea</font>

134
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,150
behind the original model and if that

135
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes again this is community driven</font>

136
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:36,030
so feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change it so what's</font>

137
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,190
available today on<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC open org which is</font>

00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:44,090
there's certainly some stuff to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> an actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process right there's the</font>

development process is documented there

discussion for betting is there those

well but really

168
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,830
you know that this should happen between

169
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,360
meetings the idea is to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up ideas</font>

170
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:53,070
here do all the work between meetings

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:57,940
and and run them through the process

172
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:59,260
when we get to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting if you're not</font>

173
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,300
on the mailing list and you're

00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,219
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this best current</font>

175
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,550
operational practices I would strongly

176
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:09,580
suggest you go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mailman dhanananda org</font>

177
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:15,520
and subscribe to the vco p mailing list

178
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:17,710
so all the work gets done so what's

179
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,289
happened since nanulak 58 well to be

180
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,229
honest not not a ton one of one of the

181
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:28,420
challenges that we've found<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the in</font>

182
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:31,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> between now time is that there's not</font>

183
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">a heavy amount of discussion on the list</font>

184
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,570
there's usually you know some amount of

185
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,130
document discussion some work gets done

186
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,870
the background people<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel this is very</font>

187
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,060
important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actively writing</font>

now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that there's been some</font>

191
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,300
significant progress on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few very big</font>

192
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,640
documents which is highlighted<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

195
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:05,590
be ratified at the moment we did do some

196
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,000
work in some just some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of basic</font>

197
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,450
operational work over the last several

198
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,500
months the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original set of servers and</font>

199
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:18,130
and lists were on inappropriate places

200
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:21,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">today they've moved to DC OPA org Alex</font>

201
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:24,880
been kind enough and supports the bc o P

202
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:28,979
track and we've moved the mailman list

203
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,690
there as well we also did some work on

204
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,240
converting the documents which were

205
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,480
originally in good old Microsoft<font color="#E5E5E5"> docx</font>

206
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,730
format to a wiki so we could have people

207
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,539
easier easier to access easier to

208
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:46,450
contribute easier to edit so I think the

209
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,500
majority of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done I think</font>

210
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,440
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of documents that</font>

211
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be converted still and thank you</font>

212
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,150
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work of</font>

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:57,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">re Chris and the network utility force</font>

214
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:59,100
for getting that done and I know there's

215
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,140
also at search in progress for a nice

216
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,600
easy wiki to PDF converter so that we

217
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,790
can hand off these documents in a nice

218
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,000
way for the global<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet to actually</font>

219
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,130
search these and see the the ratified

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,960
versioned documents in an easier format

221
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,160
in other words the wiki is intended for

222
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,130
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

223
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,250
them actively and in some sort of PDF

224
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:26,220
easy searchable one for people who are

225
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually reading them so things in</font>

226
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,000
progress this is what I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> of now I</font>

227
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,540
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some people doing some</font>

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,870
work in smaller circles and I've started

229
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,699
to hear rumblings in other forums of

230
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,050
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to use these as reference</font>

231
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,240
documents or pointers where they think

232
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,130
the content might be better served in a

233
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,470
bc o P that they can reference rather

234
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,360
than reinvent the wheel which i think is

235
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,710
actually fantastic great we've got some

236
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,520
real organic growth which is nice

237
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,590
security standards and I was being

238
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,980
worked on<font color="#CCCCCC"> thick medica</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ko is working on</font>

239
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,210
a massive bc o P for security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

240
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,270
look forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seeing that one out on</font>

241
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list I don't know if she's here</font>

242
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:07,949
that's here there's there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

243
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,900
different updates that need to happen to

244
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,000
the public peering exchange document I

245
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,380
think several<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have started</font>

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,430
reading that particularly as it relates

247
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,980
to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> IX and some standards related to</font>

248
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,089
what should happen on route servers

249
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,580
there's been some discussion on whether

250
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:26,040
or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I XP prefixes should be filtered</font>

251
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,100
from I GPS and consequence and benefits

252
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,349
I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a couple other changes</font>

253
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be made to that</font>

a work on preventing amplification

that you know some of the filtering is

not good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

practices against preventing

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:27,510
amplification attacks is there's also

276
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,640
some work on routing announcements to

<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of like should you announced</font>

280
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,390
of weird your standard set of prefixes

281
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,060
that should be announced for different

282
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,620
types of customers downstream there was

283
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,329
some discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on list I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if</font>

284
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,080
anybody actually took on the author

285
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,250
shipped to own that document that I'm

agenda for today so I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrote a quick</font>

293
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,279
one here in figured we could either use

294
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,079
this for workshop time or use this for

295
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,470
open mic time so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rough</font>

it would be great to get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on wiki</font>

344
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:13,969
right now it really isn't any discussion

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,970
topic so<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to see that</font>

response to Mike no<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay fair enough</font>

350
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:36,760
also one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't put up</font>

351
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:38,699
here which is a an interesting topic as

352
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,250
since we converted everything from

353
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:45,729
documents to wiki the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind an</font>

354
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,990
author's token has kind of disappeared a

355
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,449
little bit so I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some</font>

356
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,160
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the challenge of how do we</font>

357
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:54,880
manage who has the editing token for a

358
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,100
document in a wiki I've never done

359
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,570
document management using a wiki but

360
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,699
this was suggested by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community the</font>

361
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,199
last time we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so today</font>

362
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,339
there's only really one set of

363
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:07,329
credentials that means you can either

364
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:08,920
edit or not so love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some just</font>

365
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:10,810
some help with discussion these are on

366
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,689
list or in this room on how to resolve

367
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,160
that issue said today if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the</font>

368
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:17,380
token you just email the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll</font>

369
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort out temporary credentials for</font>

370
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,180
things but I'd love to hear any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

371
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,579
ideas on how we manage that going

372
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,888
forward and certainly you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

373
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:28,989
behind in open wiki means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

374
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:30,490
management and again you know someone

375
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">would need to manage those cycles so</font>

376
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,800
either it's going to be full of junk and

377
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,769
spam or we need to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a way to</font>

378
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,599
to lock it down so today<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've gone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

380
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,760
down wait and certainly open discussion

381
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,760
on the list or in this room about that

382
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:54,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay request for topics anybody have</font>

send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the mailing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

567
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,890
make sure nobody has any objections and

568
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,230
certainly if anybody has an objection

569
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,820
stand up now and here but otherwise

570
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,730
we'll we'll go ahead and execute that I

571
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:13,320
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes great sense as well in</font>

572
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:16,440
terms of outreach to other people and

573
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,879
what's going on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other operator forums</font>

574
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,400
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a suggestion I've heard a</font>

575
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,070
couple of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think we can have</font>

576
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,470
some folks from other regions update

577
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:29,889
maybe the wiki and the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and</font>

578
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:32,110
perhaps present in in these forums going

579
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,190
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an update or maybe I'll see</font>

580
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:37,270
if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can at least put a deck together</font>

581
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:38,470
that someone can proxy present to show

582
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,350
what's going on with those efforts as

583
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,640
well I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of them we</font>

584
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:48,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly seen things around things like</font>

585
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">right 50 150 3pc p38 etc so absolutely</font>

586
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,379
agree with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and thank you very much</font>

587
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,380
for those comments

588
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:02,020
just follow maybe we should have links

589
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:05,030
to those so I I would agree with that

590
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,740
sentiment in a very big way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

591
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:08,470
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there isn't a</font>

592
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:13,160
central repository in any other region

593
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:15,710
and they have a similar problem to this

594
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:19,430
region with the archive and replacement

595
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:21,850
of presentations so it's hard to know

596
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:27,890
when those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things get updated so I'm</font>

597
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:29,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked that the app yeah potentially yeah</font>

598
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,950
I mean it's one of those injury you kind

599
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,750
of have to ask those those respective

600
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,580
communities to take ownership<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

601
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,260
updating those things which I think we

602
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,909
can get together right and it just takes

603
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,850
a little bit of work from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

604
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,140
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> us there oh but I absolutely</font>

605
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:48,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree with that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a great</font>

606
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:48,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea yeah thank you</font>

607
00:27:51,070 --> 00:28:17,289
I think there needs to be what John say

608
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:21,070
there is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest in being hoped to</font>

609
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:24,100
understand the best ways of ensuring

610
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:28,809
that legislation which is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in many</font>

611
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:30,668
countries is minimally damaging this

612
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:34,470
desire actually comes from folks who are

613
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:34,470
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write some of this legislation</font>

614
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:42,279
so having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sortable repository or even</font>

615
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:46,949
better a totally worth dating some

616
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:46,950
documents would be extremely helpful

617
00:28:50,860 --> 00:29:07,520
important point it to the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> is with</font>

618
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:10,210
you are el aspecto we go to Morgan says

619
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,210
it works

620
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,509
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> David personally I hole already</font>

621
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,009
hard heartedly agree with you as well by

622
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:21,869
the way I know there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other</font>

623
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:27,450
efforts in other regions that are very

624
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:29,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">similar to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and we've as a handful</font>

625
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:33,059
of individuals have made some effort

626
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:36,629
into helping to globally facilitate and

627
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:40,379
enable a way for coordinated documents

628
00:29:36,629 --> 00:29:42,599
to come to exist it's been slow and a

629
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:45,658
little bit challenging but I assure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

630
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,460
there are many members of all kinds of

631
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,700
global communities trying to solve that

632
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:56,789
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would encourage you to to</font>

633
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:59,249
join in as well oh go ahead Chris so

634
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:01,590
Chris Gundam and again to that point um

635
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:03,149
I can give a quick update at least as

636
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,129
far as what I know specifically i know

637
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:07,469
there's definitely been interest in

638
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:08,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">latin america within kind of the lac</font>

639
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">nick community and lack not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community in</font>

640
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,059
starting something like this and they've

641
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,499
definitely started discussions on it I

642
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:16,320
don't know how formalized that is at

643
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point also in Africa there's been</font>

644
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,729
some very strong interest in getting

645
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:22,320
this started kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long side after</font>

646
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:24,059
nog and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then AfriNIC there as well kind</font>

647
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">of following that regions perspective</font>

648
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:31,080
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe the ripe area so there is</font>

649
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:33,090
a right bc o P off now it hasn't morphed

650
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,619
into a full working group yet but

651
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,259
there's a mailing list set up and

652
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:39,779
they've had birds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> feather sessions at</font>

653
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:41,879
least the last ride meeting if not<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

654
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:44,789
so far and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll be another one in</font>

655
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:46,978
Athens next week so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kind</font>

656
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:48,840
of coming together one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

657
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,769
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what's</font>

658
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the other</font>

659
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:55,499
communities as they go to start up a

660
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,029
specie<font color="#CCCCCC"> opie process they run into almost</font>

661
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:58,889
exactly the same set of administrative

662
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:00,749
problems that we've had here and so one

663
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:02,340
of the nice things or interesting things

664
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:04,320
we have as a challenge in front of us

665
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">and as an opportunity is to kind of pay</font>

666
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,619
of that road we're a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> further</font>

667
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,059
along than the most the rest of the

668
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:11,668
world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this respect at least</font>

669
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:13,499
within the operator communities just

670
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,500
nano dcop track has you know we talked

671
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:18,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">about for I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

672
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,540
formerly talked about probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 57</font>

673
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,889
years and now within you know we're two

674
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,330
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> into actually really getting the</font>

675
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,920
track going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and moving through meetings</font>

676
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,389
and getting the mailing list up and

677
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,700
working and so we have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a</font>

678
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,050
template that<font color="#E5E5E5"> other folks can follow but</font>

679
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,270
really you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to keep pushing</font>

680
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">on that and formalize all of it get the</font>

681
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,490
wiki work into things and we can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

682
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:39,530
provide that you know turnkey solution

683
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:41,180
for for other opping operator

684
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,230
communities who want to do this and then

685
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,700
once there are multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> operator</font>

686
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,320
community is working then it starts to

687
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,120
make sense where you know you have these

688
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,470
overlaps and and global coordination

689
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">starts section makes sense and can be</font>

690
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:53,180
really fruitful so just another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

691
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,280
think about as we're pushing forward

692
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,140
into this is that you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

693
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,090
an impact not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just on a single document</font>

694
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,200
or on a little bit of you know project

695
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,030
management or some time spent on a

696
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:06,970
mailing list but really paving the way

697
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:09,770
for what<font color="#E5E5E5"> could very well become a very</font>

698
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:12,610
significant global institution in this

699
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,610
piece EOP process

700
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:20,720
thanks for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments Chris yeah I</font>

701
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:26,719
would just echo<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in and say that</font>

702
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:29,120
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the the greatest things</font>

703
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can do is create bottoms up open</font>

704
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,809
community driven anything right best

705
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:37,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">current operation practices policies but</font>

706
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:40,330
it's also one of the greatest challenges

707
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,799
to get in place in that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no</font>

708
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,928
top-down approach to communicating

709
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,499
effectively to say hey you start up an

00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:52,730
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bottoms Up community driven process</font>
