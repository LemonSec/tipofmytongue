1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,509
alrighty so with that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce Wayne from infinera who's</font>

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:26,750
going to talk to a

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:26,750
about sdn and the transport network and

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:38,790
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

6
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,199
much I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wofford from in frontera</font>

7
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to talk about sdn and</font>

8
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:46,280
particularly bring it into the transport

9
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:53,960
network can you hear me in the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">hahaha turn it up about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright alright</font>

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,320
so sdny is the industry interested in

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,519
sdn right well as you got any guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">think are all probably very familiar</font>

14
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,619
with sdn being in the data centers

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,579
primarily right you know we in the data

16
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:14,490
centers you've taken and virtualized

17
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:16,110
computers computing power data storage

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,210
and then started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that with</font>

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,530
networking right so that allowed you to

20
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,600
bring IP routers Ethernet switches into

21
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,630
the business applications orchestration

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,210
of those resources to be closer aligned

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,649
with your business are giving you know

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,020
basically virtualizing those resources

25
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:37,710
making them programmable give me a

26
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,579
global view right so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be optimal</font>

27
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,109
and getting application driven right so

28
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,169
basically get an application control

29
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:49,859
over the infrastructure of the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

30
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure in the data centers now</font>

31
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,469
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extend that paradigm</font>

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,649
those learnings those technologies into

33
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,419
the transport network now there's some

34
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,130
interesting differences between the

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,639
packet world which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is most where most of</font>

36
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,929
SDN has gone done so far and the

37
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:08,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">transport world first of all there's a</font>

38
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:10,770
technology difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think most</font>

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,730
people understand packets connectionless

40
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,920
right it's dynamic flows right transport

41
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,869
is connection-oriented static pipes

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,849
traditionally right but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

43
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,069
interesting aspects is you know what

44
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,109
you've seen in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet world is a lot</font>

45
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,149
of controlled planes<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor-specific</font>

46
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">control planes really automating a lot</font>

47
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,819
of features whereas in the transport

48
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,319
you would haven't seen that so much

49
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:36,220
until just recently all right you've

50
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a paradigm of individual</font>

51
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,459
cross connects being made primarily by

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,590
management system right a management

53
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,510
system would create the path would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

know have an end in view you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

55
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,190
then each individual element would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

56
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,349
told what to do other hand if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

57
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,519
the packet world these systems have had

58
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:53,170
a lot of automation but it typically

59
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,700
been very<font color="#CCCCCC"> close that is there have been</font>

60
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,849
very little programmability from the

61
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,530
outside where the transfer system again

62
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:01,450
we haven't has seen so much of the

63
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,670
control plane paradigm but we definitely

64
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,890
have seen open and programmable

65
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,170
interfaces primarily because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's coming</font>

66
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,970
from a telecom a crown and they had big

67
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:16,268
<font color="#CCCCCC">OSS is that they want to do to use</font>

68
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:18,420
across their infrastructure so if you

69
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,819
look at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the motivations for</font>

70
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,738
extending<font color="#E5E5E5"> SD into a transport world</font>

71
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,140
first of all you see you know today's

72
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,360
sdn is primarily around the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center</font>

73
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,359
and around the IP network in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font>

74
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,010
center right and then tying<font color="#CCCCCC"> know basing</font>

75
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,190
a lot of applications to see that

76
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:39,608
network control that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and in</font>

77
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,410
virtualize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so now does</font>

78
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:43,989
extend it to the transport domain is to

79
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,170
bring the you know that transport OT n

80
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:50,319
which is layer one switching dwm which

81
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:53,048
gives you huge scale on fiber internet

82
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,970
network as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> addition typically</font>

83
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:56,680
right at the transport layer you start

84
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,599
to see the de<font color="#CCCCCC"> multidomain problem most</font>

85
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,250
networks that have multiple domains are

86
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,200
tied together at the transport network

87
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,780
so when you talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

88
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,668
transport them a<font color="#E5E5E5"> SD n bring us DNA</font>

89
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,620
transport you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also think of not only</font>

90
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:11,769
multi-vendor multi-layer would you think

91
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,720
about multi domain and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can bring</font>

92
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,389
sdn into the transport layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

93
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,660
you'll get and we'll be able to multi

94
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:23,380
layer optimization IP transport layer

95
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,210
and multi domain optimization<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

96
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then allow the applications right to</font>

97
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,200
really drive the usage of those those

98
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:38,229
resources again not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only multi-layer but</font>

99
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:41,870
I'll see multi domain so the central

100
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:44,390
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of aspect are to the</font>

101
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,760
bringing transport<font color="#CCCCCC"> of SDN into the</font>

102
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:49,400
transport is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transport SDN</font>

103
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,469
controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right this provides you</font>

104
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,989
the orchestration to provide the

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">virtualization of the transport</font>

106
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,940

107
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,960
network and abstraction of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

108
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:05,360
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business applications so that it</font>

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,539
they can basically orchestrate and use

110
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,760
the resources one of the keys here we

111
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,960
believe is though is that transport

112
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,730
networks have gotten much more

113
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,450
intelligent in recent years bringing in

114
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,790
more capabilities bringing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than</font>

115
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,760
just dwm which means you're trying to

116
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,460
manage waves but bringing in switching

117
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,900
technology bringing in packet

118
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,419
functionality<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can</font>

119
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,370
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> access instead of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at a</font>

120
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,140
transport network as ways you can look

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,270
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a pull bandwidth that you can</font>

122
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,530
be used bringing intelligent control

123
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,840
planes allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better control</font>

124
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,820
over that right so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe is</font>

125
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,190
important that we actually virtualize

126
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,650
that transport network to the SDN

127
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,450
controller as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

128
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">allows makes the programming of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

creation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the transport control are</font>

130
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:57,050
much easier right so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then try to</font>

131
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:59,420
get to that multi domain management that

132
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,290
we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about earlier right so</font>

133
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,550
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you know their</font>

134
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:07,910
multi-layer multi-vendor multiple main

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">business applications so you can get</font>

137
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,720
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more flexible and rapid bandwidth</font>

138
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,030

optimization of the resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

140
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:22,190
much more speed of the new services or

141
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,540
the bandwidth or how you want to use

142
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that bandwidth or how that business</font>

143
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,550
applications want to use that bandwidth

144
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:35,290
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a transport SDN</font>

145
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,610
controller we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give some some</font>

146
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,920
concepts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the scope would that</font>

147
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,200
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like and the open networking</font>

148
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">foundation has done some use cases there</font>

149
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,520
that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so the</font>

150
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,429
first one is a pure enterprise network

151
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,740
application right so where the SDN

152
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,340
controller is in the enterprise the IP

153
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,870
network is in the enterprise the DW m

154
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,869
transport network is in the enterprise

155
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:02,830
in this case the SDN controller base is

156
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:07,449
able to orchestrate all those resources

157
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:10,070
on its own second case is where a

158
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,440
network provides the transport<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer so</font>

159
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,810
the enterprise is providing the IP

160
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,080
network there's an enterprise sdn

161
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,760
controller the transport network that is

162
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,740
provided by a network provider they

163
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,150
haven't basically a network provider

164
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,960
controller that's then put an

165
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:29,270
abstraction abstracting view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

166
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">network to the enterprise so for example</font>

167
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,310
a virtual private network right maybe

168
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,650
your present just part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network of</font>

169
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,210
the overall transport network the part

170
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,880
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has control over</font>

171
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,979
and can use and then the enterprise

172
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,469
controller there is then orchestrating

173
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:52,130
the IP network and base you that virtual

174
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:54,229
network in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third case is where both</font>

175
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,580
the transport and the packet network is

176
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,770
being provided by a service provider

177
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,969
right and the service provider there

178
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,680
would also be providing in the

179
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,500
optimization between the packet layer

180
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,080
and the transport<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

181
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are presenting a higher level</font>

182
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,450
abstraction<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the enterprise and the</font>

183
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,340
SDN controller in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enterprise right</font>

184
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">of basically of the packet network</font>

186
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">well so those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically gives you a</font>

187
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,370
scope of the of how the transport Sdn

188
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:29,389
can fit into the different business

189
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:31,190
scenarios sort of key action aspect to

190
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,320
transport bringing Sdn into the

191
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,979
transport network beyond the controller

192
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,620
itself is an open transport switch

193
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:42,409
basically a virtual lightweight virtual

call the open transport switch right

196
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:51,130
that basically abstracts the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

197
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:54,260
element simplifies it<font color="#CCCCCC"> presents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a more</font>

controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> no covering resource topology</font>

200
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:06,040

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,700
services that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are created and</font>

202
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,699
provisioning through open flow

203
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,120
all right with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN model there also</font>

204
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,769
is a couple ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can control that</font>

205
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,300
all right one is it would call the

206
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,790
explicit model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very</font>

207
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:26,019
traditional sort of telco<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alto a telco</font>

208
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,910
model where the SDN controller goes to

209
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,579
each individual node and makes each

210
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:34,029
individual you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross connect right</font>

211
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:37,180
hop-by-hop provisioning right and a lot

212
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:39,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the enterprise sdn is doing that that</font>

213
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,699
same model second model is what we call

214
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,600
implicit model<font color="#CCCCCC"> where in a domain you</font>

215
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically get the whole domain</font>

216
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,130
abstracted up to the controller so the

217
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,670
controller doesn't have to do note by

218
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:53,260
note it only<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to do mr. domain</font>

219
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:57,099
domain each domain there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> MIT is</font>

220
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,170
presented as a black box to the SDN

221
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,470
controller this really facilitates much

222
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:05,110
much much<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it much easier to have a</font>

223
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:07,690
multi-domain orchestration<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright much</font>

224
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,550
easier to create an SDN controller that

225
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,980
can control multiple vendors equipment

226
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,349
and then orchestrate across multiple

227
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,060
domains<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leveraging the existing</font>

228
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,670
the control planes that are emerging in

229
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,000
transport networks so he has these two

230
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,870
models one know basically hop-by-hop

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,850
second one where you're using the

232
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,070
intelligence of you know in this case

233
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,649
the transport network to make it simpler

234
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,709
for the SDN controller by thing allows

235
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:33,940
you overall to get a more complex

236
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:35,529
orchestration over multiple vendors

237
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:41,170
multiple domains<font color="#CCCCCC"> more multiple</font>

238
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:42,939
technologies so now going to talk about

239
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,469
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple data center</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for data center</font>

240
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,040
related applications first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

241
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network service</font>

242
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,939
provider providing on the network

243
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,209
secondly where the enterprise controls

244
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,529
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself and in the second</font>

245
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:58,229
case we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a demo that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font>

246
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:02,350
with es net so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

247
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that demo in particular so here we have</font>

248
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,140
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> model where the network sir provider</font>

249
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,569
provides the network a subset of that

250
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:14,459
network is abstracted right a virtual

251
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:17,589
private network is being managed by the

252
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">client controller all right you need</font>

253
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,939
basically do bandwidth on demand with

254
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,220
that model right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

255
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:26,228
you have a subset of the network you

256
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,689
have bandwidth that you have rights to

257
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:31,929
configure you can use the SDN controller

258
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:33,368
to configure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right that same</font>

259
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:36,249
model can be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for other services</font>

260
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:39,159
right for network as a service where the

261
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:41,829
whole network is being outsourced to the

262
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:46,869
cloud right bility increased bandwidth

263
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:49,029
for packet VPNs and reconfiguring the

264
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:50,529
networking case of application router

265
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">failures for example right you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

266
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:56,559
a router fails you might have a backup

00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,239
router or in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 41 router back up and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

268
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,728
router fails I just basically

269
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:02,889
reconfigure the transport network all

270
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:05,439
the flows that were all the circuits

271

that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rec the router</font>

272
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:11,108
that fails now I can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> muscle</font>

274
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:14,859
you'll be pretty much from an IP layer

275
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:16,959
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be basically transparent</font>

276
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:20,889
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like me change it if the</font>

277
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,348
topology in that case right you can also

278
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,909
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically as i mentioned</font>

279
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:26,859
bandwidth on demand you can do today you

280
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:28,929
might want to change how much bandwidth

281
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:31,659
goes to different data centers now as

282
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:33,339
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as you with virtualized data</font>

based on time<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost add a time of day the</font>

287
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,929
modify the transport network to

288
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:47,979
facilitate that getting more bandwidth

289

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the day so now i'm going to talk</font>

292
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:59,279
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the demo with es net so yes net is</font>

293
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,429
a very large network in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

294
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,809
connecting a large number of research

a lot of data no 10 petabytes of data a

00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:15,279
month and that networks growing<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times</font>

298
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:16,869
every four years one of the issues they

299
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,809
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they have a lot of you know</font>

300
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:24,220
typical business applications short this

301
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:26,559
short birthday applications but they

302
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:30,179
also have a lot of really big data flows

303
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:32,860
that related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scientific nature of</font>

304
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:35,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">high energy physics</font>

305
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,910
and those flows the normal IP network

306
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,960
will basically just just crush all those

307
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:43,390
small bursty applications so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font>

308
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,460
solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that was to have an SDN</font>

309
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:49,000
controller allowed them to do bandwidth

310
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:51,520
on demand so when you have the big flows

311
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,470
right you can make a reservation between

312
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,760
the two endpoints actually we go to the

313
00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:03,220
next slide here<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so this is the the</font>

314
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:06,850
GUI for their SDN controller so here you

315
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,860
can basically have a your originating

316
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,570
destination you can reserve a certain

317
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,600
amount of bandwidth you can set a

318
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,950
quality service around latency right and

319
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,210
you can have a time that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

320
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:21,550
have this circuit for so<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the SDN</font>

321
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,680

322
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:28,900
create these on me with on-demand flows

323
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,489
to keep that the big data off their IP

324
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">network so everybody's do we directly</font>

325

326
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so in this in this demo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yes</font>

327

connecting the nodes in the lab right

345
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,200
each of those have a different data a

00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,710
data path available data amount

347
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,430

349
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:53,079
gig each of them have a different Layton

350
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,110
Layton see each of them have a different

351
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,930
hop counts right and then the SDN

352
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,540
controller then can select a path based

353
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:05,859
on all right so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned and when</font>

354
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,870
a customer of Oscars wants to make a

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:15,540
bandwidth and delay and a time of day

357
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:18,880
right and destination so<font color="#E5E5E5"> using that the</font>

358
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,459
SDN controller can then set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for</font>

359
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,810
provision a network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and it can</font>

360
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,910
choose three different paths<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

361
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:27,459
based on the quality of service metrics

362
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,130
all right and in this demo we did

363
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:33,040
actually both implicit and explicit

364
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:35,920
routing provisioning right so excellent

365
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,079
meaning the controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to know the</font>

366
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole topology of the network had to</font>

00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,980
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically figure out what</font>

368
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,920
were the service metrics that can be

369
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,770
obtained on each path and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font>

370
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,479
implicit which basically allows the

371
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,660
network itself using this control plane

372
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,280
to determine you know whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

373
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,839
what were the quality service metrics

374
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,610
based on the quality service metrics of

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">just in summary here knowing the key</font>

380
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,800
things is that extending sdn to the

381
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,110
transport layer gives you opportunity

382
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,060
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get multi-layer multi-vendor and</font>

up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> delivery of services but if you</font>

387
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,130
know I said the transport network it's

388
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,480
always been programmable what it hasn't

389
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,870
been is really been tied<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

390
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,370

transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> there will make you know allow</font>

392
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,860
the basically applications to get the

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,809
access to that real-time bandwidth as it

394
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,870
needs it can orchestrate it

395
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:07,749
can change the network as it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:09,489
the most optimized<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and it</font>

397
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:12,490
makes much easier if I was just

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:16,860
mentioning to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the network and modify</font>

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,860
it any questions

400
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:35,799
don't be shy<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks there you go I've got</font>

401
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,259
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question sure thank you so coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

402
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:41,860
the IP world I'm pretty naive about the

403
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:44,590
transport layer when I think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to IP</font>

404
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,959
topology I think of various links and

405
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:50,350
nodes where each link has same metrics

406
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,090
and capacities associated with them what

407
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,509
type of topology information would be

408
00:18:52,090 --> 00:19:03,519
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a transport network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

409
00:18:55,509 --> 00:19:09,789
good question<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so Reese you</font>

410
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:11,919
know depending on basically so transfer

411
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:13,090
layers there's actually transfer in the

412
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,909
transport network there's actually a

413
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,500
fair number of different vendors have I

414
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:20,830
guess how much intelligence is in that

415
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,210
note that node right so some some of the

416
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,100
transfer nodes are just basically

417
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,169
point-to-point some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring in</font>

418
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,330
more intelligence for example in this

419
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:30,429
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the infra network you also</font>

420
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:33,189
have a switching element in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

421
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:35,379
the DW ml element<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and you have a</font>

422
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:39,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">junior this control plane so actually</font>

423
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:41,080
you would see you will get<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

424
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:44,679
transport network there a connectivity

map very similar to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would see</font>

426
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,570
an IP and you also get actually quality

427
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:51,009
of service metrics<font color="#E5E5E5"> running mainly around</font>

428
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,860
bandwidth and latency those are the

429
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:56,590
typically the two so available<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth</font>

430
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,939
right and latency the typically matric

431
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,759
metrics that people want although

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes a distance is an important</font>

metric all right hop count for a

provision is a 100g what kind of

443
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:35,559
distance you're looking at so we in the

444
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:39,119
network result was established right so

445
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:41,500
within right and we were using

446
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,658
integrated switching OT and switching

447
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:49,210
into notes so actually was basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

448
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:55,360
seconds right to provision that distance

449
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:57,669
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean this was in a</font>

450
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,529
lab you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the distance doesn't really</font>

451
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:02,139
matter in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network this</font>

452
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:03,460
was a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred kilometers but do</font>

453
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">we actually do the whole thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

454
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,629
nation not wide network right because

455
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,399
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the integrated switching and</font>

456
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:13,928
the GM<font color="#CCCCCC"> placed control plane you're able</font>

457
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:16,029
to basically abstract you know abstract

458
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:18,190
that to just a full bandwidth that you

459
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:19,840
can control<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly right the otm</font>

460
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,549
switching allows you to basically make

461
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,439
those connections immediately the

462
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:28,230
control button allows you to do you know

463
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,230
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a connection welcome</font>

464
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:37,069
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>

465
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,480
you
