00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,080
destination that your highest paying

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,349
customers are using to terminate voice

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,480
calls or IP VPNs or something like that

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,919
then the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic is very</font>

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,490
high to you so if you have to spend it

00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:24,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">it send it as a preferred path via the</font>

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,299
more expensive link if it keeps your

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:30,140
highest paying customers happy you're

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,989
probably willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that so this is</font>

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:37,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah the context of how much</font>

11
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:39,050
traffic you have comes in and analyzing

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,400
what that traffic might be generically

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,610
i'm not saying look in the traffic and

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">see if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's movies pictures whatever i'm</font>

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,840
saying does it if it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,579
destination network is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a VoIP</font>

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,250
network used by your top customers for

18
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:53,540
example then it's it's not just general

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,910
traffic you should care about it a

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,070
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and maybe want to work</font>

21
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,019
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the destination</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> networks to find</font>

22
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,950
out why they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to signal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:06,110
that the other path is less preferred

24
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,659
here's some config examples that that

25
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,270
can do the deterministic routing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

26
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:13,969
we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the example where am I</font>

27
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,490
my suggestion<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for your</font>

28
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:18,678
top n networks and n is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number that</font>

29
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,089
is right for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you depending on how many</font>

30
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,399

31
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,189
traffic to remember I'm saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

32
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:28,280
should configure a preferred path and a

33
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:30,350
deterministic failover path but for your

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,359
top end networks here's an example of

35
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,359
how this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done over to exchange</font>

there is no failure your top

61

example to death now it's clear right

62
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:59,410
cool let's perhaps look at again<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

63
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,910
mainly outbound network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time</font>

64
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,329
the network has got many points<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

65
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,070
presence so here we introduce the

66
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,880
concept of hot potato routing routing

67
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:12,010
sorry it's it's another word for hot

68
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">potatoes nearest exit you trying to</font>

69
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:18,250
deliver the traffic to another network

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,400
at the closest point to the way on your

71
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:24,900
own network you generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that traffic</font>

once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this scenario of network</font>

73
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,140
needs you to understand who your top

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,619
traffic sinks out where are you sending

75
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,359

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:39,370
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with a way to encourage hot</font>

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:42,370
potato routing on your network for your

78
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,230
top traffic sinks is to peer with those

top<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic thinks that all the places</font>

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,630
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a mutual pub and and I'll</font>

81
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,360
cover what this means in a moment in

82
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,070
more detail and ignore the the meds the

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Med attributes from others uncover what</font>

84
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,380
that means at the moment here we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

85
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,209
slightly more complex example then of

86
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,120
the the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so we've got a</font>

87
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:07,570
network that's that's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> three points of</font>

88
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,280
presence around Europe I picked Berlin

89
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,989
Frankfurt Amsterdam they have a number

90
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,820
of private pairings a number of exchange

91
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:18,340
point earrings and hear what the example

92
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,048
here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh if you lose a point of</font>

93
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,510
presence if you lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> say amsterdam at</font>

94
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:24,700
this point and does the traffic go away

95
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,560
altogether or does it move do you know

96
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,990
can you run<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amsterdam as an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> island or</font>

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,770
does the traffic just just just move

98
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,680
somewhere else because in the

99
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,900
in the context of most people's networks

100
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,099
their internal backbone links are more

101
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,020
expensive than trying I p transit or

102
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:45,650
appeared<font color="#E5E5E5"> links so if you if you end up</font>

103
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,180
losing a pop on your network that's

104
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,409
that's the analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do</font>

105
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,000
where does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that traffic go in this</font>

106
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:55,009
scenario and you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,500
might be doing is sending in this

108
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,729
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amsterdam it makes a little bit</font>

109
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,110
more sense in you at this like Sam

110
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,539
Saddam<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Berlin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and much further away</font>

111
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,909
than Frankfurt yet you've got appearing

112
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:06,409
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s1 and s2 out of amsterdam by</font>

113
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:08,300
default you may well<font color="#E5E5E5"> be carrying all</font>

114
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:09,949
that traffic to Berlin when it might

115
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,419
just be much more sensible to appear

116
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:13,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to hand the traffic off to a</font>

117
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,139
transit provider in Frankfurt because

118
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,610
it's an it miss and nearest city you're

119
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:20,419
carrying it on your network for the

120
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">lowest amount of time and handing off at</font>

121
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,930
the nearest city helps keep the traffic

122
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,669
local stopping stopping the traffic

123
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">traveling in this case across Europe and</font>

124
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,299
back if the other network that you're

125
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,710
sending to is in Amsterdam as well so

126
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,219
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this I remember the example that</font>

127
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:36,888
this is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it's a key point</font>

128
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:38,690
here if you lose a pop are you going to

129
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">be carrying the traffic a long long way</font>

130
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,580
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the way you've got the</font>

131
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,489
next nearest p.m. and if you understand

132
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,198
that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you understand what happens if</font>

133
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,569
you lose a pop to your top tap traffic

134
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,729
destinations then you'll cope with both

135
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:58,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic growth and the failures of</font>

136
00:05:52,729 --> 00:06:01,219
callings so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two out bad</font>

137
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,229
examples are just recap those in it's

138
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:05,360
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> for outbound heavy networks much</font>

139
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,880
easier you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use deterministic routing</font>

140
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,250
to your best effect and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

141
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,889
traffic will leave via specific means

and not left to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp best path selection</font>

143

algorithms bottom options or auto chance

144
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,698
basically it's the same things leaving

145
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,319
two channels now if you're leaving

<font color="#E5E5E5">your traffic will take completely</font>

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:34,039
a failure let's look at some inbound

00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:35,750
traffic engineering examples this is

152
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,460
much harder again because you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

153
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,960
to trick other people's best path

154
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,388
selection algorithms you've got to try

155
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,159
and get them to so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,280
move how your traffic reaches you and

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't administrate that router you</font>

don't administer the other router but

161
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,490
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible because as</font>

162
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">I keep saying if you're a typical</font>

163
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:05,560
Network your largest flows will be with

164
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,909
a relatively small<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of a esas and</font>

165
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,290
if you've got traffic to somebody and

166
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,020
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large amount of traffic to</font>

167
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,300
somebody it's in their interests to work

168
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,789
with you and deliver it properly to your

169
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,740
network as well it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in anybody's</font>

170
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,660
interest to ignore each other and and

171
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,040
leave traffic to chance so it's not

172
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,780
impossible it's harder but it's not

173
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:29,270
impossible now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technique that</font>

174
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,950
comes with a big health warning and i'll

175
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,020
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right now and a few times</font>

176
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,909
during the explanation of this if you're

177
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:39,099
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use this technique you've got</font>

178
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:41,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this entire example and and</font>

179
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,620
it's very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important you follow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

180
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,310

181
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:51,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">use this you can shape inbound traffic</font>

182
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:53,630
engineering very very aggressively by

183
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,300
announcing shorter prefixes to some of

184
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:58,190
your peers or some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your destination</font>

185
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,200
networks the way the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

186
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,550
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that prefix length is</font>

187
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,800
considered before the best path

188
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,160
selection algorithm so here if you've

189
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,940
got this / 16 inside 10 now you can see

190
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that by splitting into two /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Seventeen's</font>

191
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,100
your peer network will see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> d</font>

192
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,720

193
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,640
even start best path selection algorithm

00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will say this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the shot is prefect</font>

195
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,159
so i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send the traffic this</font>

196
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:28,250
way now there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with just</font>

197
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,840
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just say hey I'm an</font>

198
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,510
inbound heavy network i'm going to do

199
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,610
selective announcements everywhere to my

200
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,979
peers it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fine because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

201
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">not selective announcements are often</font>

202
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:42,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered quite rude quite aggressive</font>

203
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,720
and they could mean that yes for as long

204
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,670
as the pairings up your traffic inbound

205
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,650
traffic's coming in the right way but it

206
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,079
may if you're doing this if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if</font>

207
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,220
you've really got<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four prefixes</font>

208
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,750
when aggregated on the internet and

209
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,300
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending up here's 20 or 30</font>

210
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,600
prefixes and they may well end up deep

211
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,729
here

212
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,410
you and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order to be a good internet</font>

213
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,850
citizen it's really important you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

214
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,380
announce your selective d aggregates

215
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:11,000
globally because well see every single

216
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,860
none of since the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time for</font>

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,529
why that's bad it gets discuss every

218
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,740
time but it can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really really</font>

219
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:22,490
great effects in specific circumstances

220
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:25,220
so if you normally you do this when you

221
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,259
work work with appear and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say you're</font>

222
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,850
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in delivering traffic so my</font>

223
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:31,279
customers are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best way possible</font>

224
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,250
it's in both of our interests for me to

225
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,660
give you a hand and selective

226
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,819
announcements<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the best way to do</font>

227
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">this so if you if you peer for example</font>

228
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:43,399
with the same payer or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same transit</font>

229
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,740
provider in multiple locations you can

230
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,500
announce the aggregate prefix in all of

231
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">your locations and regional split</font>

232
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,040
selective announcements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just have</font>

233
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:56,000
customers in that particular region in

234
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,560
it you have to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with permission</font>

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,449
really you have to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the pier to</font>

236
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's acceptable to do that</font>

237
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:04,670
and and agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a mutual</font>

238
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,130
interest in doing selective

239
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,930
announcements<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it works really really</font>

240
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,449
well it's the best way of shaping

241
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,849
inbound traffic but if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

242
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:15,740
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your transit provider it's</font>

243
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,829
very important you use the no export

244
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,880
community on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the d aggregates</font>

245
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:21,829
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you announce sort of transit</font>

246
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,810
provider so that the transit provider

247
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:30,290
isn't announcing those<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the default</font>

248
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:32,060
free zone does that make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

249
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,399
inbound inbound traffic engineering are

250
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,729
really really really another blunt soul

251
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,829
is the is the aggregation but a typical

252
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,019
way that people handle inbound traffic

253
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:44,899
engineering to good effect as well as a

254
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:47,000
s path prepending now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

255
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:49,399
technique<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows you to signal a</font>

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,069
path<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ingress path into your network</font>

257
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">may be less preferred than another</font>

258
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:56,120
ingress path on your network because you

259
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:58,219
artificially make the a s path the

260
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,899
length longer by putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own a s</font>

261
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,939
number in it more than once<font color="#E5E5E5"> so by</font>

262
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:04,130
default you'll be in there once you put

263
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:05,750
in there two times three times that path

264
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,070
looks like a less preferred path by

265
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,110
defaults<font color="#CCCCCC"> European</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network now</font>

266
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,530
this has a marginal effect it works

267
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">normally works pretty well when you make</font>

268
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:19,360
maybe prepend<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so you're a s appears</font>

269
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,739
two times<font color="#CCCCCC"> and but it degrades quickly</font>

270
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,900
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you then make it</font>

271
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,150
appear three times the effect is less

272
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:28,090
big four times the effect is much less

273
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,090
big five times probably very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

274
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:33,850
no effect at all and we all see people

275
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,770
prepending there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times or</font>

276
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,530
something in the default free zone and

277
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:41,260
that about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conclusions always well</font>

278
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:43,270
that must be a typo right because by the

279
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,520
time that you've done this four times

280
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:49,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the effect really really does fall away</font>

281
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:53,020
in my experience now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

282
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,689
where it's most effective is where you

283
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,760
have more than one bgp intersection with

284
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:02,200
the same distance yet or the same remote

285
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">ASCAP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ras and you can signal to this</font>

286
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,380
network whether they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the same city</font>

287
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,380
you won't want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a preferred link</font>

288
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:10,900
and one to be a backup link so that that

289
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:14,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">works really really really well but it</font>

290
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,510
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be heard because remember your</font>

291
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,070
transit networks and people will take

292
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,790
the shortest<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s path normally unless</font>

293
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:24,370
they're using local prep 222 route

294
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:27,130
differently your longest<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s paths may</font>

295
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,930
not even appear the distant a esas so

296
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,000
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's three or four real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AS IS</font>

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">away from you may only actually see the</font>

shortest path not the longest<font color="#CCCCCC"> patent</font>

299
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,750
there's no way you can influence that

300
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,030
for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason it's another fairly</font>

301
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:44,170
blunt tool but it can move some traffic

302
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:45,339
if you if you have a link if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

303
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,229
two links on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network which you</font>

304
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,780
consider fairly equivalent and you want

305
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,210
to balance them for simplicity reasons

306
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,740
you may find that prepending via one of

307
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">those links just cause is that to happen</font>

308
00:12:53,740 --> 00:13:01,450
I've certainly seen that in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past you</font>

309
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,840
can oh now you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a lot more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

310
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:07,300
imagine a world where you can signal to

00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,700
your transit provider what I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

313
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,600
not prepend in this direction and you'll

314
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably you'll often find that your</font>

315

transit provider has given you a tool

316
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,970
that lets you do that so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

317
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,540
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then why it might</font>

318
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,389
work in a moment here

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">whose network is its 3320 telecom so</font>

00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:27,899
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an those are the community</font>

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,990
and to influence the way that they will

323
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:37,800
handle your traffic is as a custom app

324
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:41,190
so you see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> she is really so this</font>

325
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,560
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Deutsche Telekom is giving</font>

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s in the middle when they send</font>

specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer or to an upstream or to a</font>

330
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:01,560

331
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,269
transit but with their transit but you

332
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,439
find that you often have poor

333
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:09,630
performance to a specific guess who like

334
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,709
to telecom in this case pier with you

335
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:15,300
can send your<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that send your prefixes</font>

336
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,399
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually come without any prepending</font>

337
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,819
and signal to them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

338
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,750
prepend two times just to this is and

339
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:26,610
that will cause you to be able to

340
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,920
influence your inbound traffic via

341
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,630
transit provider to try and cause a

342
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,010
completely different<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

343
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,630
to use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different route on to your</font>

344
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:38,310
network so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really this is a</font>

345
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,260
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more finely grained way of doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

346
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">as path prepending if your transit</font>

347
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,430
provider supports it and then just

348
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">prepending straight to your transit</font>

349
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,859
provider and it works enormously well

350
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,750
for handling times where you know you're

351
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,370
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your transit provider they're</font>

352
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,630
working out for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the price you</font>

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,420
like the service but there's one

00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,370
particular link that they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

355
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,599
gives you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some headaches you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

356
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,519
make that problem you can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> mash that</font>

357
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,199
problem so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're influencing that</font>

00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network to use some other</font>

routes your network that works that

360
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,980
works really really well you do this by

361
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,000
attaching the community to the prefix

362
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:20,630
when you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to your transit</font>

363
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:23,370
provider here the no export community

364
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually turn off the</font>

365
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,430
announcement if you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

366
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,019
interconnection between your transit

367
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,689
provider and<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party network is so</font>

368
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,610
bad you can also use<font color="#E5E5E5"> communities to</font>

369
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:33,589
signal that you shouldn't send your

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,390
prefix about

371
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:39,410
how to you whatsoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> thy transit which</font>

372
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:41,120
is really really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> really handy so</font>

373
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,480
we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a as path prepending</font>

374
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,920
being the blunt tool that often works

375
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,880
we've talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how you can get your</font>

376
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:53,750
transit provider to signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> praise preppy</font>

377
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,630
printing some other techniques it can be

378
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">useful the the med is a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

379
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,430
handy tool in this scenario it's it

380
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,170
causes you remember i talked about if

381
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,449
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> an outbound network and you want</font>

382
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,189
to do a then you have multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> pups</font>

383
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,800
you'd normally want to send traffic out

384
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:13,220
the closest point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> originate</font>

385
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">the traffic in this scenario having</font>

386
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,290
having meds it's the opposite of that it

387
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,200
means carry the traffic on your network

388
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,339
for as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can to the so that</font>

389
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,140
you hand it to me as close to the

390
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,710
customers possible not as close to where

391
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concept generated as possible it</font>

392
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:33,230
only works<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you sending to this same</font>

393
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,790
pier so if you send meds via transit

394
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,680
provider a and transit provider be a

395
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,079
kind of context that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

396
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,819
meaningless if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send the meds to</font>

397
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,590
transit provider a in two different

398
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,390
cities and you're sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> different meds</font>

399
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,600
in both cities that will cause traffic

400
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:50,060
to come to you in different in different

401
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,680
ways so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on one prefix if you</font>

402
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,060
signaled I'd like the traffic to be

403
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,739
carried to me to this city<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

404
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,560
prefix you'll get the traffic in on that

405
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:01,480
city as long as they're not filtering

406
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:03,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">your meds normally you transit provider</font>

407
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,569
by default<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my experience transit</font>

408
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,900
providers are quite happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take an</font>

409
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:10,520
honor meds by default peers are probably

410
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,590
less likely to take an honor meds

411
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,629
because the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

412
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,609
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is are there any peers</font>

413
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,390
people who appear in the room who who

414
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:22,909
honor meds yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see a couple is</font>

415
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,840
that do you do you want to say anything

416
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,840
about why

417
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:25,190
yep exactly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's apps meds work</font>

418
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,580
really really well where traffic is

419
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-value traffic for for one or both</font>

420
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,679
of the parties another example is for

421
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:38,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">example in voice networks where VoIP</font>

422
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,970
companies might say my backbone is

423
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,530
entirely over provisioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have I</font>

424
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,150
upgrade a link when it hits twenty

425
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,970
percent because I'm so latency sensitive

426
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,580
i'm so lost sensitive and the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

427
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,460
my traffic I built by the minute right

428
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,370
so I really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work all the</font>

429
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,140
time and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see voice companies</font>

430
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,050
sometimes saying will pay with you will

431
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:03,320
pay with lots of exchanges or pay with

432
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,540
you widely and you can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> me your meds</font>

433
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,240
because my backbone is uncongested and

434
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:11,690
if you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I'll carry the traffic to</font>

435
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,040
where your customer is because i want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

436
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,270
i want to make as much money as I kind

bone than it is for me to think your

439
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,300
backbones always going to work so a lot

440
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,620
of the time peers drop meds but

441
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes I've heard a couple of</font>

442
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,209
examples today we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers say I'll</font>

443
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,610
honor your meds and the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to deal</font>

444
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:33,590
with to understand whether it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

445
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:35,000
work is to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the p.m. and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i put</font>

446
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,490

447
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,020
I'll turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of flattened meds if you</font>

448
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,210
specifically don't want to carry meds

449
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,680
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how you do it but I a</font>

450
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,910
much better solution is to work with

451
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:50,360
your peers and find out why they're

452
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:53,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to send them to you the other</font>

453
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,000
really hacky thing that works quite well

454
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,040
he's actually changing the origin

455
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,150
attribute on a prefix which again should

456
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,620
only be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in probably should only</font>

457
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,450
be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you found other things</font>

458
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,889
haven't worked and you're really

459
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:10,280
struggling to make a concept with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer</font>

460
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:12,220
or something but it's this it is another

461
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy thing that kind of works</font>

462
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,890
and the way that this works if a if the

463
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:21,879
a s path is equal length if the local

464
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:23,289
pref is equal value eventually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

465
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,690
best path selection algorithm will

466
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:27,940
decide to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the origin whether the</font>

467
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,850
origin is set to its<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of really a</font>

468
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,400
flag I GP GP or incomplete and it gives

469
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,678
prefix but an occasion where it learns a

470
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,110
prefix via an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Origin that's set to igp</font>

471
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,390
preference over one where the flag is er

472
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:44,860
to EGP and over one where the flag is

473
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:47,559
set to origin so sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> often p is</font>

474
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,090
set to I<font color="#CCCCCC"> GP or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> EGP by default and</font>

475
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:51,668
nullify the effects of you doing this

476
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,340
but this this again does work if

477
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:55,990
actually talking to people as failed

478
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,570
sometimes to allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to influence</font>

479
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,669
inbound traffic to you where you're

expecting local<font color="#E5E5E5"> pref na s path length to</font>

481
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:06,580
be the same but what does put<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

482
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,110
inbound traffic engineering what

483
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,449
actually works really really well and

484
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:13,178
what works really really well is is

485
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,530
over-provisioning appearing with the top

486
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:18,100
networks are going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your data</font>

487
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:20,020
working out who the most important from

00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,610
a traffic volume point of view networks

489
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:26,139
are and peering with them really widely

490
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,928
so that failures of a single link don't

491
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,130
cause unexpected break kings and

492
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:33,130
failures can be handled in<font color="#CCCCCC"> political</font>

493
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,419
ways and the thing that works really

494
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,159
really really well is building

495
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,130
relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those top end</font>

496
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,179
networks that are sending your traffic

497
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,210
constantly monitor and manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

498
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:45,610

yourself new peers cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably won't</font>

504
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:03,370

<font color="#CCCCCC">long term what does manage relationships</font>

share that collect and share data with

peering coordinators at forums just like

510
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,620
this one because if you're an inbound

<font color="#E5E5E5">stand out head and shoulders above a lot</font>

off emails<font color="#CCCCCC"> hade you'll appear if you can</font>

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,340
literally do some head and shoulders

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,250
otherwise the other thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do</font>

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,800
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a reputation for protecting your</font>

traffic engineering if peering widely is

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,640
the only thing that works really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

537
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,370
you've got to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your peers</font>

538
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,460
interests which means responding to

<font color="#E5E5E5">abuse complaints really really quickly</font>

listing your network comparing gb very

way do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you buy your transit from the</font>

quality of your inbound traffic

552
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,040
performance anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you're</font>

553
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:45,040
buying if you believe that peering

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,460
widely is best then you buy capacity

555
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,050
from a well-paid network then you get

556
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,970
the benefit of them having the same

557
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,919
values and and them having the same

558
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,920
attitudes to appearing widely as you do

00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,220
buying from someone who shares those

quality buying traffic from your top

564
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:15,040
destination no fuel if you really rely

565
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:16,929
on if say a third of your traffic comes

566
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,730
from a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s or goes to a single a</font>

567
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:24,790

568
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:26,770
transit from them because if the traffic

is high value of it if it's a lot of

575
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,010
your traffic for example it's really

576
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,100
really important

577
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:44,560
so even though peering of course is the

578
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Holy Grail actually service availability</font>

579
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,610
and service performances and if you know

580
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your top destination will study</font>

581
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,689
transit at a price that's fair and

582
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:55,240
reasonable then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> a third of your</font>

583
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,980
traffic as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract wraps around it so</font>

584
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,370
saying that it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

585
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,390
should work oh and if you if you know

586
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,219
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of that traffic is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

587
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,660
stay on net at that network you might be

588
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:12,130
able to negotiate a better price anyway

589
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:13,570
so go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your data I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

590
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,670
bit of a discussion I want to have a few

591
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes for this question so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I might</font>

592
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:20,530
jump through the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of slides</font>

593
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:22,810
relatively quickly so I'll from dealing

594
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,129
with a note of hearing out our favorite

595
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,540
one here is peering around the problem

596
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">if someone says they won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay with you</font>

597
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,050
go and peer with their customers or try

598
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and sell bandwidth to the customers</font>

599
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:36,669
because you can say to their customers

600
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:39,360
hey I I'm a bed appeared network than

601
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:45,010
your current transit provider and

602
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,479
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works what I'll do I</font>

603
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,770
really do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 20 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

604
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussions so that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to zip on</font>

605
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:54,550
to the last slide the thing the thing to

606
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,840
take away is that appearing on the

607
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,639
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it changes every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

608
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,889
and capacity on internet grows<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day</font>

609
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,680
small networks become large large net

610
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:04,390
but it's become even larger a bad path

611
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,070
might change change overnight so it's

612
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,630
really really really important if you're

613
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do traffic engineering the</font>

614
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,540
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need more than anything else I</font>

615
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,730
thinking he wasn't anything whatsoever

616
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,010
is data it's really really really

617
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,690
important and starting out with data

618
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:19,300
that you can analyze from time to time

619
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,890
is good building instrumentation that

620
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,290
gives you real-time information is

621
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:26,680
better and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just starting out</font>

622
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:28,990
with a snapshot in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time it's better than</font>

623
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,430
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> having no data at all and it's</font>

624
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,800
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can build on into the holy</font>

625
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,660
grail of real-time information about

626
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,520
your top traffic sinks destinations

627
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,610
you'll ultimately one day use it for

628
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,560
abuse prevention and abuse mitigation

629
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,850
but just starting out by dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

630
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:47,310
your traffic more effectively is a good

631
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:50,709
place right so build the data

632
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:52,870
what I want to do now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we</font>

633
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,090
have until eleven o'clock so there's 20

634
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:57,010
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really really really love to</font>

635
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:00,580
hear some stories from<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the</font>

636
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:03,700
room who might say your idea sucks I

637
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,230
tried it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it doesn't work and but</font>

638
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,430
this is why and so we can have a

639
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,770
discussion or<font color="#E5E5E5"> we if someone in the room</font>

640
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:10,810
wants to say your idea worked really

641
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:13,060
well for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me when I did this that's</font>

642
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:15,190
really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if if anyone would be</font>

643
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,010
willing together get us going just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

644
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:20,440
20 minutes I can see you standing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

645
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,360
speak no there's a microphone over here

646
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,950
Oh excellent there's a microphone so

647
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:29,080
we've got it question already remember

648
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:33,040
to say your name oh please wait 30

649
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,810
huawei technologies high end of august i

650
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,240
was attending the other conference

651
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:40,120
called AB network there's a traffic

652
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,630
engineering session including a bt p

653
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:46,149
talk it provides a very nice simulation

654
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:48,370
true basically if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pair with</font>

655
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:50,410
someone you can just you know simulate

656
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:54,010
that environment let's see how your

657
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:56,020
traffic are impacted of course yours is

658
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,730
also excellent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

659
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">all this kind of topic brought me and</font>

660
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:04,630
very strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest so study the</font>

661
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:07,500
economic view of this kind of hearing

662
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:10,330
and what will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the road</font>

663
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,570
because an appearing link will change

664
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:15,669
your topology will change your traffic

665
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,919
distributions and all things changed yes

666
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:20,440
have you been doing anything like this

667
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:24,910
or maybe the audience here 10 comments

668
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,590
on an<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so yeah I when you pair widely</font>

669
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,090
and when you mainly set up a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> PL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

670
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">cause it a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic to swing your</font>

671
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:34,120
topology definitely changes absolutely

672
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,860
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want you often want</font>

673
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,510
to move this traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> off an expensive</font>

674
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,699
link or an unreliable link or something

675
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:43,210
onto a link that you specifically prefer

676
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,770
and if you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> preferred link and a</font>

677
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,950
backup link and you know those<font color="#CCCCCC"> two a</font>

678
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:49,660
resilience<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for those purposes then</font>

679
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,000
that's really really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

680
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's a dangerous scuze me excuse</font>

681
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,670
me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bad thing that</font>

682
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">your topology changes its what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

683
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:59,830
and in terms of getting information if

684
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can overlay</font>

685
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,639
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> having it's about data and</font>

686
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,620
instrumentation again so if you have a

687
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,539
weather map on your network that shows

688
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">you the utilization and when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

689
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:12,700
change what what changes kind of explain

690
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:16,418
things am i keeping my knocking for them

691
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:18,130
are they talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me properly that's</font>

692
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:20,649
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I think that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal with</font>

693
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,659
the topology change and from a

694
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:24,639
predictability and a reliability point

695
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:26,019
of view but I'd be interested to hear

696
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,549
you know people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room have got the</font>

697
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:29,200
horror<font color="#CCCCCC"> stories about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening and</font>

698
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:31,679
what they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at some</font>

699
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,679
other good thing

700
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,990
hey Andy hey guy my name is guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tolly</font>

701
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:50,590
work at verizon terremark a fantastic

702
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:52,809
job I've done similar presentations in

703
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:56,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">the past and you really condensed it</font>

704
00:29:52,809 --> 00:30:00,370
down very well no I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hit all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

705
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,210
the nuances that you know the different

706
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,049
traffic engineering methods employ

707
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,299
there's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to</font>

708
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:09,700
mention and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just minor</font>

709
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:11,320
little thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> too but when you were</font>

710
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:16,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about during</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the a s Pratt as</font>

711
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:18,490
path prepending you were saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

712
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:22,029
far side might not see your prepend

713
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:25,210
because you know the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

714
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:27,309
selects the best path and but as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

715
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,289
you're so the only thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to</font>

716
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know if you're doing this AS</font>

717
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:37,259
path prepending to the same upstream

718
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:37,259
then you still achieve your goal because

719
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:42,340
that network will advertise out only the

720
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:45,730
best path so the traffic will still come

721
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,809
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and then once it hits them you</font>

722
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,700
know the rest of the internet doesn't

723
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:50,830
need to know that you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use one</font>

00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">link of your trans provider versus the</font>

725
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:56,168
other so it'll it'll come reach them and

726
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,090
then that decision stays local on that

727
00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:01,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">network where the best place you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

728
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:05,590
get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from them so it's still still is</font>

729
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just want to point out that most of</font>

730
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,549
the time as long as you're only doing

731
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:12,940
this to the one upstream it still<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

732
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:14,139
out so I it seemed a little like you

733
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,029
were saying it might not work but I

734
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:17,678
think it will work as long as it's only

735
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:20,080
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one provider if you do it to</font>

736
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,629
multiple providers then you know who

737
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows what happens yeah exactly it's the</font>

738
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:28,000
same logic as selective path sorry am

739
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,230
selective prefixes or<font color="#CCCCCC"> D aggregates if</font>

740
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,539
you only send them to your transit

741
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,730
provider with no exports then the same

742
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:35,740
the same logic applies it doesn't matter

743
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,950
that you'd being<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing this kind of</font>

744
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:41,080
dirty thing that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much a battling</font>

746
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,460
but it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> your transit provider who</font>

747
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,990

deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so it is your own dirty</font>

749
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">secret at that point and it's the same</font>

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:53,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of logic then and then the only</font>

752
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:59,469
you did make a valid point that you can

753
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:02,350
d aggregate and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence the</font>

754
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:06,070
the traffic decision before it even hits

00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:08,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">PGP and technically that's true but you</font>

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,350
know working at a carrier working at a

758
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:18,820
in the past we hate that do not do that

759
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,830
it's absolutely it drives people crazy a

know agreement one thing that almost

768
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,520
everybody stresses is having the equal

772
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:57,280
would let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and find a</font>

00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:59,170
halfway position here because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a</font>

774
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,660
sensible thing a sensible way to react

775
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,940
might be to say if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know how to</font>

776
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,670
stop those d aggregates from leaving the

777
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:09,280
people that you're sending them to then

778
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:11,980
don't do them if you do know how to stop

779
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that happening and then it might be</font>

780
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,850
something you can do it and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

781
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,820
your transit provider as the fair game

782
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,080
in my opinion you're paying them they

783
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,500
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be making any money but you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">paying them</font>

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,870
yes agreed fantastic presentation my

787
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:37,539
networks my question was towards traffic

788
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,179
engineering around 95th percentile

789
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:42,190
billing and how you deal with that with

790
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:50,620
bursty traffic with multiple transit

791
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:52,059
providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's a set of games</font>

792
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,399
I haven't personally played I know the

793
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:56,168
other it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a game that can be played</font>

making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:04,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of time and you probably I've not</font>

797
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,860
I've not done that before I could

798
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:10,119
imagine the logic is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">instrumentation you've got you set a in</font>

800
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:15,820
your polls if you poll every five

801
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:17,800
minutes then you've got a day's worth of

802
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,419
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows you breach threshold I</font>

803
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,020
guess you could then have a script that

804
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:24,609
goes and down prefs various things

805
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">automatically until the midnight on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

806
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:27,668
thirty-first of the month or something I

807
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,379
imagine there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could do</font>

808
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,638
that it's automatic I imagine there's

809
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:32,139
people in the room who have done it was

810
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,720
nodding to themselves going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up save a</font>

811

813
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:41,109
does that or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe some of the</font>

room does and it's valid it's a it's a

815
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:46,389
valid way of dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> things but if</font>

816

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it my I guess that after I've</font>

817
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:53,139
now thought about it my thoughts are if

818
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,969
you're if this is enough of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

819
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:58,180
for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to save money</font>

820
00:34:54,969 --> 00:35:00,430
by building this automation and

821
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,629
instrumentation you should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

822
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,578
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

823
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,859
causing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to burst is and try and pair</font>

824
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:08,260
it off because in my opinion that's

825
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:09,819
going to be cheaper than<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintaining a</font>

826
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,490
system that's logging into root is all

827
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:17,050
hours of the day and night and might do

828
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:19,328
something wrong that would be my thought

829
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:22,060
I don't know maybe there is a tool that

830
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:23,440
does this stuff automatically but that

831
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,430
would be my voice if there's enough

832
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,280
traffic that's causing you an

833
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:29,759
operational concern pair it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

834
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,760
let it grow

835
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:38,700
I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize re i'm at</font>

836
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:41,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">p-tech from yahoo again i really want to</font>

837
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:45,149
emphasize a point you<font color="#E5E5E5"> made in passing</font>

838
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:47,970
peering DB is out there use it make sure

839
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,380
your information is updated in it when

840
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,970
you're talking to somebody and saying

841
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,520
hey I've got a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic for you</font>

842
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,560
I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your network one</font>

843
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,780
of the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> things as a major content</font>

844
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,970
provider we do is look up your record

845
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,820
and peering DB if you don't have a

846
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:05,098
record and peering DB right off the bat

847
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,770
it puts you from the clue phul category

848
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:10,109
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the oh god maybe we'll just pretend</font>

849
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:13,320
we didn't see this email<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a category</font>

850
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:15,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">so first things first make sure that</font>

851
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,730
record is there and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you update</font>

852
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,770
it because when we go to build neighbors

853
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,910
you say hey we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to peer we're going</font>

854
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,369
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the router and build appears</font>

855
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:24,990
based on what's in there and if your eye

856
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:28,410
peas aren't correct if you're a s is

857
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:30,479
incorrect hey it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not coming up the</font>

858
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:33,720
other piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in reference to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

859
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,030
aggregation before you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about d</font>

860
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,680
aggregating make sure you talk to the

861
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,609
people upstream even if it's a transit

862
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,680
provider because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

863
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:43,770
embarrassing when you figure hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

864
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,680
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> da grenade this 16 2 / 24 s to my</font>

865
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,390
transit provider it'll all be fine what

866
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,098
the hell my max prefix popped in

867
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,640
suddenly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have no transit connection</font>

868
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:56,010
anymore oh my god life is sucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

869
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,049
they may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a max prefix set against</font>

870
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,580
you that looks reasonable based on your

871
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,910
IP space and when you suddenly d

872
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,920
aggregate boom you pop it your transits

873
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,868
gone so yeah communicate communicate

874
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:12,089
communicate before you do stunts like

875
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:14,700
that great comments yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> really yeah</font>

876
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:16,320
you're absolutely right if you're going

877
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,759
to do selective<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcers you get a dik</font>

880
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:25,490
they might just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ruin your day back for</font>

881
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:25,490
your terms of ruining this

884
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:46,300
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you from the tools perspective</font>

885
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,960
have you explored any traffic

886
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,340
engineering modeling tools so to analyze

887
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,960
failover scenarios and where your

888
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:58,320
traffic will go from you know if you

889
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:01,930
lose them one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your major peers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

890
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:06,610
this will make<font color="#CCCCCC"> me some really lame but I</font>

891
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:08,560
just use Excel because because in the

892
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,810
roles where I've worked in the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

893
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:16,630
years it's been a the case that I've

said on the on the in the slightest it's

895
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:22,510
typically max about for once I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">about four tas is in the list it's</font>

899
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:29,080
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case for</font>

everybody it won't be the case for

anyone at Google I can i but for many

00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:39,190
access networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm talking about about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">peak because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the number that</font>

that's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the amount of traffic</font>

909
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,220
I've got a deal with if I'm if I don't

910
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,350
want to congest anything so I've got the

911
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,669
peak traffic today I know roughly how

912
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,110
much where traffic is growing so if I'm

913
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,000
doing this exercise every three months

914
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,890
and I know my traffic is growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

915
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">temps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and every three months I take this</font>

917
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,470
doing today add ten percent that's the

918
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,410
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got a deal with on the on</font>

919
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:15,180
the preferred and the failover path and

920
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:18,009
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take it off with a pencil or</font>

921
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:20,169
highlight it and it's a nice it's a nice

922
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:23,170
job to do with a cup of tea and a

923
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:25,480
biscuit and a spreadsheet rather than am

924
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,490
I my biscuits a difference yours I

925
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,610
remember now but it's a nice it's a nice

926
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,720
job to do on a Friday afternoon and

927
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:33,490
because it's interesting what's change

928
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,470
what's happened then<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I find that</font>

929
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it manually helps me spot things</font>

930
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:39,700
that I might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> missed if I computers</font>

931
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,819
doing the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me Wow why is this</font>

932
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:45,399
network from the next city over suddenly

933
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,980
in my top 20 they came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nowhere</font>

934
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,680
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to phone that my friend who</font>

935
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,940
works there

936
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,828
that what they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and maybe we can</font>

937
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,119
partner and do whatever product is

938
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:55,460
interesting that my customers have

939
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,079
started to buy I want to know this so

940
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,640
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes traffic engineering is</font>

941
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,079
this is human element as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and</font>

942
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,569
figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out why someone jumped in the</font>

943
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:09,020
top so I tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it by hand beaker</font>

944
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:12,050
because that I'm interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in why as</font>

945
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:14,569
well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> what maybe someone knows of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

946
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:25,430
all better than them better than exhale

947
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:27,940
I think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> nantou sir hi Andy my name is</font>

948
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:31,098
Anand boudewijn I work for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripe NCC</font>

949
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:36,440
I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and perhaps</font>

950
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:41,630
for the entire room actually so we

951
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:44,690
operate any cost k<font color="#E5E5E5"> route any cars and we</font>

952
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:49,550
have this model where we announced our

953
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:52,880
prefixes with no export tagged at some

954
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:56,150
of our exchanges whereas we have other

955
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:01,309
global instances where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use no</font>

956
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:04,460
export so we we sometimes get questions

957
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:08,030
from people in saying that that hurts

958
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:10,970
them because you know if they're large

959
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:13,670
provider they might end up sending their

960
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:17,299
traffic to some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our local instances</font>

961
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:21,730
instead of Global's um so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

962
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:25,250
really is um who else uses this kind of

963
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering and what's your opinion</font>

964
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,510
about doing this because we've been

965
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">considering dropping the no export and</font>

966
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:34,670
letting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers decide for themselves</font>

967
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:38,119
whether they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to further propagate</font>

968
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,170
our prefix or not yeah be interested to

969
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:43,400
hear other people's thoughts I mean my

970
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:45,619
my concern might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> at if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I if it wasn't</font>

971
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,290
done carefully I might cause my prefix

972
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:50,119
not to appear at my peers customers

973
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:52,400
networks or something because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

974
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:58,869
know just what people are doing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

975
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,869
to to deal with traffic so if them if

976
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:05,020
yeah if they if your pre which has

977
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:08,230
become shadowed then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's then they're</font>

978
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,820
not appearing anyway if if everyone's

979
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,050
upstream has got them as no export cuz

980
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,420
they're not going to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers</font>

981
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:16,180
downstream you might it would be

982
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:18,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to know as well if your</font>

983
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,660
peers any of your peers are dropping the

984
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,550
new export community now they're saying

985
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:24,609
learn no communities at all from my

986
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:28,030
peers and that sort of thing so we have

987
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:30,670
some peers who do I dropped<font color="#E5E5E5"> an excuse me</font>

988
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:34,780
who do drop the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new export um after</font>

989
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:37,600
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> consulted with us because without</font>

990
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,580
that you know they weren't sending us

991
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,440
any traffic at all and have a whole

992
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:46,000
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customers that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted due</font>

993
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,670
to propagate the prefix to so and that

994
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,980
works for them so i think that's some

995
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:53,170
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are looking at doing in the</font>

996
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,930
future I just wanted opinions from

997
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:58,330
anyone else might have experience in

998
00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:00,279
this area I mean the thing about the

999
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:02,560
ripe NCC specifically is you guys know

1000
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,050
just how whether someone's our transit

1001
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">AAS or whether someone's an end asn you</font>

1002
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:11,200
could build into your peering automation

1003
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:14,110
if someone's probably and end sites and

1004
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,330
and they happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be peering which is</font>

1005
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:18,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">great I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that n sites that pier and</font>

1006
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:20,529
and it's good that they do that but you

1007
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,109
can send<font color="#CCCCCC"> them no export then and if they</font>

1008
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:26,320
happen to be a transit is then then send

1009
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:30,070
them send them without you that might

1010
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:36,220
work sounds like a lot of work sounds

1011
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:37,600
like a hell of a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font>

1012
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,520
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the break so I</font>

1013
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,259
don't mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking one-on-one questions</font>

1014
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,080
or more questions from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room or if</font>

1015
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:47,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get an early coffee that's</font>

1016
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,920
cool as well there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question from</font>

1017
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">Matt</font>

1018
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just give it a slight alternate</font>

1019
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:59,370
view on any casting we also do any

1020
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:01,980
casting globally and rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than trying</font>

1021
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make use of a no export community to</font>

1022
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,830
limit it but we actually tagged our

1023
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">anycast routes is with our location</font>

1024
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:14,279
information but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to work with</font>

1025
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:16,109
upstream transit provider or peers with

1026
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,360
if they have communities that we can set

1027
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,560
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> limiting the propagation we tend to</font>

1028
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,270
see that the big problem with any

1029
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,250
casting is when you start crossing ocean

1030
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,410
boundaries and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1031
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,330
within a region we kind of don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care if</font>

1032
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we hand it to appear and it turns out</font>

1033
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:31,410
that they hand it to something somebody

1034
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:34,320
else we more care about saying look

1035
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:37,020
please<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't send the Asia any cats</font>

1036
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:39,030
blocks to the US that's kind of sucky

1037
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,590
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> users</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of sucky for you</font>

1038
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,650
you're hauling traffic more than you

1039
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:45,060
need to and again communication most of

1040
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,920
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you talk to networks and</font>

1041
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:49,259
say look we're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this</font>

1042
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,640
better for the users and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1043
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,250
save you money we really want the

1044
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,339
traffic to come locally so if you leak

1045
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:58,200
it off to some large Tier one in the US

1046
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,090
and you're a customer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tier 1 in the</font>

1047
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,740
US and suddenly all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic from</font>

1048
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,450
that tier 1 in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. because oh my</font>

1049
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,129
god<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can send this to a customer hey</font>

1050
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,560
I'm sending the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way even if</font>

1051
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:09,810
it's going halfway around the planet and

1052
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,910
nobody wins in that situation so in most

1053
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:15,270
cases when you actually you know give

1054
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,980
meringue send them an email and say look

1055
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,410
we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be the best for the</font>

1056
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,210
users we can what communities or

1057
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,450
controls do you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

1058
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:27,960
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> anycast prefix stays in the region</font>

1059
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:29,819
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> most networks will have some level</font>

1060
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,200
of control that they say well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1061
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,540
advertise<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but he's in this</font>

1062
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,879
community we keep it within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> region I</font>

1063
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,050
if networks don't know what communities

1064
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,460
are if they don't know how to limit

1065
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:44,190
propagation the extreme case is you just

1066
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:45,570
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I'm sorry your your clue</font>

1067
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:48,840
factor is too low i'm going to have to

1068
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:51,240
DP r you go take some classes from

1069
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,220
awesome people like candy and learn

1070
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,319
about bgp and learn about communities

1071
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,180
and limiting route propagation and then

1072
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,860
hey come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and tell us you've gotten</font>

1073
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,730
clue level up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we can talk again</font>

1074
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks</font>

1075
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:10,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions that was a</font>

1076
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:13,010
lot of fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> description as well</font>

1077
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:15,020
I think that wraps it up then thank you

1078
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:18,280
ever so much for coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> along and I'll</font>

1079
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,280
be here during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the break you wanna chat</font>
