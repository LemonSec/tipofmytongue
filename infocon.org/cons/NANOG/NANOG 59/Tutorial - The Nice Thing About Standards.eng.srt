1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,219
and for a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes and before I dive</font>

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,369
in how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you are actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

3
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,320
midst of rolling up out v6 or already

4
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,550
have deployed v6 in places in your

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,410
backbones networks and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,980
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> already starting to do with any of</font>

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:34,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition technology choices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,340
so and I'm actually going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,289
through all of this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll probably</font>

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">be done early because my expectation is</font>

11
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:40,949
that once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through this there will</font>

12
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,870
be more detailed questions about either

13
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:45,300
individual technologies or some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,409
trade-offs so I actually sort of built

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,589
that in am hoping to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion</font>

16
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:52,260
so if you are sort of looking through

17
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:57,589
and looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we will be I'm having</font>

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:05,128
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> questioning answer at the end so ipv6</font>

19
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:08,610
is any day now rolling out and the ITF

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,920
and it's a infinite wisdom decided that

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,830
when back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 98 when they they finished</font>

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,220
it they said and then of course in 2003

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,720
when they finished dhcpv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're sort of</font>

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,050
surprised that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world didn't dive on</font>

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,570
all of it and so they s decided that we

26
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:28,170
needed lots and lots of help in coming

27
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,809
up with interesting new ways so there's

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,860
an old joke from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> aunty tenenbaum</font>

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,290
networking book the nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about</font>

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,840
standards is that there are so many to

31
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,910
choose from and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of that</font>

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,830
usually doesn't get added but it's even

33
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">more apropos in this case is it and if</font>

34
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,259
you don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it stick around it'll be</font>

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:50,870
different next year and so unfortunately

36
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:55,290
what has<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened is we have a wealth of</font>

37
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:56,670
transition technology choices and when

38
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,090
you first start looking all of them and

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,590
you start reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and about the</font>

40
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,860
third one in your eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to glaze</font>

41
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,780
and you start trying to pick out what's

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,699
actually different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you get to this</font>

43
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,500
point where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start thinking you know</font>

44
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,988
I'm pretty sure I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard this before</font>

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,849
and I'm not really sure what's different

46
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:17,520
about this one or that one or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

47
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:20,350
one except the name and I'm not really

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,610
sure which one fixes the

49
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:28,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm trying to solve so what I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

50
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:30,790
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically break down what</font>

51
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,660
fundamentally is lying under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hood of</font>

52
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:37,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of them come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with some</font>

53
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,910
descriptions and examples of for those

54
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,440
types what actual implementations there

55
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:46,540
are and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of how do you</font>

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,050
individually go through figure out what

57
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,049
your pain points are and then decide

58
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,190
what actually may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be appropriate for you</font>

59
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,220
there are a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things though that</font>

60
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">I really do like to stress one of the</font>

61
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:05,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">things to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember is that this is</font>

62
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:07,750
transition it is not permanent we hope

63
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,310
in internet terms I suspect it probably

64
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,130
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my guess is that we will</font>

65
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very long tail in corners of our</font>

66
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">network but when I say not permanent and</font>

67
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,450
getting rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what I'm talking about is</font>

68
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically getting to a point where what</font>

69
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,810
you have left are these tiny little

70
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,760
pockets buried in the corners<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

71
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">network in the same way that we still</font>

72
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,209
have a s400 S&S na + x 25 and other crap

73
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,600
buried in some wiring closet somewhere

74
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:36,430
because we can't quite get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

75
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,670
hopefully sometime in the next five to

76
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years will be at a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place where v4</font>

77
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,859
will very much be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exception and v6</font>

78
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,780
will actually be these about protocol so

79
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,480
that's certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing is</font>

80
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,630
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an endpoint they are a way</font>

81
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,970
of getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to someplace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else the other</font>

82
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,460
thing to stress is these should be your

83
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,690
last choice and as we go through the

84
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:03,310
trade-offs with these you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will start to</font>

85
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,690
understand why one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the classic things</font>

86
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,280
of course that marketing people hate to

87
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:11,260
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we engineers tend to say very</font>

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,300
often is it sucks less and that's pretty

89
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,370
much the mentality that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

90
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:19,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">be having as we go through these they do</font>

91
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,330
all suck they are all compromises and

92
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:24,370
bad choices but also as network

93
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,680
engineers we<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize that frequently we</font>

94
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,010
must do things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not our first</font>

95
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,980
second or even<font color="#CCCCCC"> twelfth choice it's more</font>

96
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:36,030
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to make an informed</font>

97
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:39,740
decision so it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece this is</font>

98
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what you do you know</font>

99
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">prerequisites what are you starting with</font>

100
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,450
what are your problems um do you have

101
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,280
partners or other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you need to</font>

102
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,719
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finally once you sort</font>

103
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,460
of scrape together all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your problems</font>

104
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,320
that pick your<font color="#E5E5E5"> poison so the first thing</font>

105
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:00,330
obviously is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do need to</font>

106
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">know everything and unlike most network</font>

107
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:07,080
upgrades v6 is such a fundamental change

108
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,350
that it pretty much pervades all of the

109
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:14,070
layers pretty much three through nine

110
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:17,370
and we will actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to assist</font>

111
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">people with software apps development</font>

112
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,070
all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things and know what</font>

113
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:26,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually doing with our wire</font>

114
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:28,560
because we and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just say once</font>

115
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,010
it gets turned into a packet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets</font>

116
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,570
spit out a<font color="#CCCCCC"> nic interface it's a network</font>

117
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,520
thing and when it goes back in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick</font>

118
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">interface it becomes a system thing and</font>

119
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,900
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really need to coordinate</font>

120
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,940
there's an awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of visibility that</font>

121
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,380
must happen in both places and<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

122
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,590
you really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what address</font>

123
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,000
space v4 and v6 you are using what types

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,520
of addresses you know how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">1918 space what are your requirements</font>

126
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,229
for doing some kind of address obscuring

127
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,840
and v6 all of the other things you know

128

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are your subnetting schemes one of</font>

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,539
the nice things about v6 is for the

<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that across primary links and your</font>

are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and again</font>

160
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:30,309
what are they actually trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with</font>

161
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:32,888
the wire becomes important again you

00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,459
things with NAT whether we like it or

164
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,659
not so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is that there's a</font>

165
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:40,329
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> range of things that are just</font>

166
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:41,800
screwed you know if you want to be able

167
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,539
to do certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-to-end or certain type</font>

168
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,899
of game applications or certain types of

00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:51,339
voice over IP or various other things

170
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:55,659
you're just stuck and so you the answer

171
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:58,179
just is no well users still want to do

172
00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:01,419
an awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and with v6 you</font>

173
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:04,989
know we can start offering a lot of

174
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:06,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">those services again again depending on</font>

175
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,969
what transition technologies we may be

176
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:12,490
choosing and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what</font>

177
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:14,229
they're doing and we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

178
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,259
talk to the app developers who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing</font>

181
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,869
become educated I mean the sad reality

182
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,159
is is that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an awful lot of</font>

things they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in before that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and before and have never worked</font>

185
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:30,369
in before and some of these people I get

186
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:34,419
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and they somehow think that</font>

187
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:36,459
v6 will magically fix this no it will

188
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,279
break in exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> or nearly exactly the</font>

189
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:42,848
same ways in v6 and in some cases there

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,740
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more possible vectors or exposed</font>

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,480
will pound um

193
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,819
and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> more so there are things like</font>

194
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,850
qos that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually could work you</font>

195
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,170

the headers now potentially we could

out up front and again providing

lot of providers give you a / 48 as your

you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got three disparate sites you</font>

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:41,380
we can't control them they have their

speaking every transition technology

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:33,660
there are several technologies that will

when you're trying to reverse engineer

what the hell transition technology foo

of the protocol you can introduce those

369
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,449
they are not inherent in the design of

dual stack this is what the IETF

371
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:20,240
recommends because it's easy and they

think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're done and if you can do</font>

the issues it's like taking cortisone

move until the cortisone wears off

you're also doubling your workload and

doubling the number of places in which

correctly and not break something else

or introduce new problems that you did

yes the one of the problems of course

00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:00,208
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that that is inherently evil</font>

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,519
sugarcoat this but you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> told me</font>

logging requirements become painful

436
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:29,728
there are performance issues there's

437
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:31,679
resource exhaustion issues we tell

438
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:33,029
ourselves where some people tell

439
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,820
themselves I try not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lie to myself</font>

440
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:37,109
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that because at</font>

441

least we're getting additional security

442
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:43,199
which is not true the part of that that

443
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:45,239
people think of security is not inherent

444
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,309
in address translation is a stateful

445
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:49,619
firewall that<font color="#CCCCCC"> map's one address on a</font>

00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:55,859
I did not say with private addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">can do this with public addresses just</font>

00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:01,739

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,840
includes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these trade-offs with</font>

said yes we know you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt is</font>

broken and you think that we should all

do dual stack an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-to-end but we have</font>

have NAT and<font color="#E5E5E5"> b6 and so the ITF sort of</font>

492
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,110
scratched its head and it went off and

493
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,580
so what it implemented because everyone

494
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,979
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better we know</font>

495
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,740
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have that 66 we'd rather</font>

496
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,200
not have every vendor do their own way

497
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:12,390
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do an RFC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't have</font>

498
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,520
to use it but at least if you are going

499
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it everybody's vendor</font>

500
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,560
will implement it the same way and the

501
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,640
IETF went trucking off and what they

502
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:26,460
produce was nat PT wherein all you're

503
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,950
doing is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at most addresses</font>

504
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,630
essentially the leftmost 64 bits the

505
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,990
first 64 bits which is the network

506
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:36,750
prefix portion in a standard subnet of a

507
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:39,390
/ 64 and the rightmost 64 bits is the

508
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,160
host ID what they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is everything that</font>

509
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes through the box has the network</font>

510
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,350
portion for the internal side replaced

511
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,390
with the external which means you have a

512
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:52,139
one-to-one correspondence and that

513
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:54,780
internal host address is known and you

514
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,090
can get directly to them because when it

515
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,950
takes off that internal prefix and puts

516
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,570
the external one on on the way out on

517
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way back it does the exact reverse</font>

518
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,340
so you can get directly to every host so

519
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,040
the part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> map that everybody wanted</font>

520
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:12,149
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually stateful firewall this</font>

521
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,070
is absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> useless and what they said</font>

522
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,419
was what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

523
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:18,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">for is so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">renumber your network except most of us</font>

525
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,909
don't renumber networks all that often

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,259
net 10 so which of the two do we re

number these are both have used<font color="#E5E5E5"> GU a you</font>

532
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:38,929
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to so NAT PT was pretty much</font>

533
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,519
solving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that nobody had and</font>

534
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:43,850
failing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address what had been asked</font>

535
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:45,830
for but you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> understand what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

536
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,139
because there will people be people who

537
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:55,460
will say oh why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we just do pt</font>

538
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:57,590
instead it's not the same so tunnels we

539
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:03,409
all love tunnels because they have

540
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:05,658
oncoming trains so again these are all

541
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:07,730
things as soon as a tunnel is a virtual

542
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:10,070
thing and what you do is basically you

543
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,320
configure two ends as if I get it at

544
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this end I'm going to skip the physical</font>

545
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,470
topology and ignore all of that I'm

546
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to send it to the other end</font>

547
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,399
gateway because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

548
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,419
configured for and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do to get</font>

549
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:22,758
it through all of the intervening

550
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:25,639
network is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick state</font>

551
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:28,129
information around it it really is sort

552
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:29,299
of encapsulation but it's a specialized

553
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:34,250
type and it usually has pre

554
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:38,049
configuration so it means that you have

555
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,730
abstracted the actual physical path and

556
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:42,590
lost all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that information including</font>

557
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,230
sizes of pipes and potential with

558
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:49,490
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with MTU and pipe size issues</font>

559
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:52,070
and added extra state so if i<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

560
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,350
1500 byte packet and then I stick<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

561
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,928
through a tunnel and other things have a

00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">fifty hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> MTU it's too big so I'm</font>

563
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:01,429

<font color="#E5E5E5">know that fragmentation works so Ellen</font>

565
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:06,769
before so maximum segment size is MTU

566
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,309
mismatches all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

567
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:12,049
fragmentation and reassembly all of

568
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:14,210
those things are done badly even when

569
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:16,070
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the physical topology of the</font>

570
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,080
network and you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">every hop along the way and try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and fix</font>

572
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,600
it because there are multiple apps that

00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,850
break MTU discovery multiple people that

574

all of these NM v6 you have the PMT you

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:42,370
discovery problem as well because it's

580

the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unless both ends of the</font>

what the tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet its size is and</font>

583
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:55,150
of course vendors never write code

584
00:26:53,020 --> 00:27:00,420
that's wrong or failed to think about

585
00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:00,420
the implications PMT you doesn't work

586
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:11,100
in all things abstraction layers are

587
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:16,890
useful if you understand what they are

588
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:21,330
but by definition abstraction layers are

589
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:25,650
opaque and hide the physical topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

virtual is that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignore that</font>

592
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:36,399
topology and treated in a simpler

593
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:40,480
fashion the problem is you only have

594
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,770
these simpler information there are a

595
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,140
huge number of apps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

596
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,940
fundamentally broken one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

597
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,700
fun things is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing tunneling</font>

598
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:53,049
where you are sending v4 packets over a

599
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:54,640
v6 network in a tunnel there may be

600
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:59,049
translation and other fun things

601
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:02,429
happening so embedding v4 addresses as

602
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:06,190
part of your v6 may complicate things it

603
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:09,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">also takes away that security by</font>

604
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:13,600
obscurity because now I know what the

605
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:16,658
1918 address of that box is because it's

606
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,399
encoded as part of the v6 address and I

607
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:22,270
know where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because that prefix is</font>

608
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:26,350
being announced publicly so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

609
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:29,529
unintended security disclosures when you

00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,418
do tunneling there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

611
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:33,490
routing loops and other various stuff

with automatic tunneling<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we'll talk</font>

613
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,440
a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about automatic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

614
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:43,390
static tunneling<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's an RFC that</font>

615
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:46,090
details some of those issues and they

616
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,610
had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was more generic that</font>

617
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:53,439
basically talks about tunneling in

618
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:57,428
general things that in v4 or v6 or god

forbid<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ceylon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s or whatever if it's a</font>

620
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:01,559
tunnel there will be certain types of

621
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:04,539
issues and certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> type 2 security holes</font>

622
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:08,529
if you do dynamic tunneling this is

623
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:10,510
where what happens is the gateway that

624
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:12,789
you hand your packet to that has the

625
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,200
that actually has the tunnel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends</font>

626
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:17,450
things out

627
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,570
you don't have to configure statically

628
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:23,420
as your gateway there are varying means

629
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:25,429
by which you can dynamically find

630
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:28,100
someone who's willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take your</font>

631
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,500
packets wrap the tunnel wrapping around

632
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,750
them shoot them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> over that virtual</font>

633
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:38,270
link and get them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end for</font>

634
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:40,370
you the problem is one of the means of

635
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,210
doing that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> any cast and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

636
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:48,800

637
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:50,270
anycast hosts may change so if you're in

638
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,710
the middle of a TCP session and this

639
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:53,629
router is the one you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

of like with<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP and having multiple d</font>

649
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,630

651
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:32,920
you have to plan for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of those</font>

652
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,570
sloshes across your network

653
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,700
alternatively and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about one</font>

654
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,649
of the protocols that does this you

00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually just throw it out and hope that</font>

656
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:44,330
there's somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is provided a</font>

657
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,909
gateway and you have no clue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

658
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:49,159
their connectivity is how reliable they

659
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:55,150
are and you can have horrible

660
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:58,820
performance and in general if your

661
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:01,130
capacity planning method is to chuck it

662
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,820
upstream and hope that the guy upstream

663
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,230
from you did a better job of planning

664
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:10,730
you may be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some unpleasant</font>

665
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:13,850
surprises and now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last of the three</font>

666
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:15,620
encapsulation for the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font>

667
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:18,620
encapsulation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunneling really are</font>

668
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:23,020
kind of the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing the difference is</font>

669
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:25,760
that encapsulation is less

670
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,580
fungible in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an obvious</font>

671
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,040
virtual pipe created you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of let</font>

672
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,600
all the packets go wherever and all of

673
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,590
the packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> have their own state you</font>

674
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,600
don't necessarily have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

675
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:40,100
hard-coded ends that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing a</font>

676
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,629
tunnel with but it's less fungible but

677
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,189
effectively it really is the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

678
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,700
you have something at one end that wraps

679
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,930
stuff around your packet shoves it off

680
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,370
and something at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other end that</font>

681
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,710
unwraps it and throws it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the end</font>

682
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:55,879
wire hopefully in the same state it was

683
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:57,350
packed so because you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

684
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,870
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have many of the same</font>

685
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:03,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems for many of the same reasons</font>

686
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:07,340
because you know you're adding size you

687
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:11,240
are just joining the abstraction or

688
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:14,000
virtual and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical layers you are</font>

689
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,170
making MTU<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovery maximum segment</font>

690
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,290
size and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

691
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,940
harder to figure out an easier to break

692
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:24,430
in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it isn't necessarily</font>

693
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:27,080
a pipe it doesn't it also introduces

694
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:30,980
more possibilities for packet insertion

695
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:35,139
you can do packet insertion attacks with

696
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:37,790
a tunnel by if I'm sending from A to B

697
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:42,200
bad person can just send traffic to be

698
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:45,379
pretending to be a and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's UDP base</font>

699
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,750
you may actually be able to correctly do

700
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,310
the header stuff for the tunneling part

701
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,950
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and you may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to insert</font>

702
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:54,230
but encapsulation tends to be a more

703
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,720
open architecture and all and it is more

704
00:32:54,230 --> 00:33:00,200
likely the other and usually the more

705
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,940
fatal flaw is this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those both</font>

706
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,750
ends have to agree and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have software</font>

707
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:08,390
that matches and talks nicely<font color="#CCCCCC"> tunneling</font>

708
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:11,300
you throw it to another box so you have

709
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:13,370
routers or servers that must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> upgraded</font>

710
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,050
or both<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked but all the end devices</font>

711
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:19,340
can be untouched in encapsulation

712
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:21,980
usually you pick encapsulation because

713
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,050
you want to push further and further to

714
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:27,500
the edges and<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the complexity out of</font>

715
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:32,090
your core but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost is at a certain</font>

716
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:34,310
point there will come<font color="#CCCCCC"> a box that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

717
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,340
be where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would like that work to be</font>

718
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,050
done

719
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:42,050
but that you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that box</font>

720
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:45,930
might be a customer my pcp device so

721
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:49,980
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the baggage we start with as</font>

722
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:53,630
soon as you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing tunneling i</font>

723
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:56,100
am doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> naps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i am doing encapsulation</font>

724
00:33:53,630 --> 00:34:00,120
now let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of our</font>

725
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:06,899
spectacular choices and starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my</font>

726
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:09,359
favorite once again act so nat64 has

727
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:15,960
actually been probably one of the more

728
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:18,120
widely used and in most cases when you

729
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,620
hear carrier-grade NAT when it first

730
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,620
came out carrier grade that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was an</font>

731
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:26,429
oxymoron it was a marketing term because

732
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:28,799
it wasn't that but if by carrier grade

733
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:30,060
you meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a carrier of large scale</font>

734
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,340
could use it and you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

735
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,489
survive the abuse that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the case</font>

736
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:37,920
um there were a whole series of things

737
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:40,500
that couldn't do or weren't functional

738
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:45,270
in a true carrier-grade environment that

739
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:48,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem has been fixed at a cost but</font>

740
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:52,800
first let's sort of go through nat64 how

741
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:56,159
it actually works so if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a v6 only</font>

742
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,890
client which is very common these days

743
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,850
with wireless networks and LTE networks

744
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:05,150
the handsets are v6 only because they

745
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:09,540
couldn't get enough before addresses and

746
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:13,200
they decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to do NAT 444 and use</font>

747
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:17,700
1918 space so that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually did the</font>

748
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:20,129
less sucky thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

749
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,560
ipv4 address and I go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS 64</font>

750
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,730
resolver it'll actually go out on the

751
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,590
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will actually try and</font>

752
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">resolve that and what it will get back</font>

753
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:31,710
as a no data response and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS when I</font>

754
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:33,629
give a query and i get no data back what

755
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:37,740
the server is telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me is that label</font>

756
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:39,210
IP for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> com does have data but</font>

757
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:43,410
the resource type that you asked for

758
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:45,870
cuate doesn't exist and it's a hint that

759
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,200
you can ask for other records in that

760
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,630
label and get

761
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,339
well it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good guess that most</font>

762
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that don't have a quad a will at</font>

763
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,230
least have an a record at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

764
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:00,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">does get an answer back and it gets a v4</font>

765
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:03,650
address well that's not terribly useful

766
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:06,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a v6 only client so what happens is</font>

767
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:09,260
the DNS 64 resolver takes that address

768
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,950
and it slaps a prefix in front of it and

769
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:16,220
it lies it says the authoritative server

770
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:21,230
told me that the quad a record for that

771
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:23,480
IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is that v6 address your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stack</font>

772
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:25,900
now has an address so it makes a

773
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,370
connection and it hits the nat64 gateway

774
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,840
and what the nat64 gateway does is it

775
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:32,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">looks and says oh i see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

776
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:36,680
prefix that's special you know wears a

777
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:41,210
helmet short bus special and it strips

778
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff off and it says that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a v4</font>

779
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:46,490
address and i will make a v4 connection

780
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">tcp off to that web server and that web</font>

781
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,750
server will happily spew whatever

782
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:54,890
content you are feverishly waiting for

783
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:57,530
and then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt's 64 box will then</font>

784
00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:00,529
slam that prefix right back on and that

785
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:05,720
client is perfectly happy and you can

786
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to any v4 site that way the nice</font>

787
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:15,350
thing is if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS 64 resolver looks</font>

788
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:18,470
for a quad a and there was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can</font>

789
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:22,190
hand it back and that client can make a

790
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:28,549
v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> native connection so it is quasi dual</font>

791
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:33,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">stack it has a v6 path and it has a</font>

792
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:35,060
virtual v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact you can reuse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the DNS</font>

793
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,400
resolvers because you can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

794
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,500
queries for fairly low load and as long

795
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,390
as all of the nat64 boxes all agree on

796
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same prefix you can have multiple</font>

797
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:48,109
nap six fours for performance and load

798
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:51,030
sharing and one dns 64 resolver and it

799
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:55,140
will work just fine and

800
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:56,970
with carrier-grade NAT most of the major

801
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:01,020
vendors now have them the downside is

802
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:03,689
they are expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

803
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,920
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> now do v6 only everywhere</font>

804
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,950
for all your clients for all that

805
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:11,040
intermediates stuff and get to a v6

806
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:14,520
internet and get moving towards actually

807
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,230
being a real v6 only and still support

808
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:20,340
all of that content that is not yet

809
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:22,800
available on before and there are a lot

810
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:25,860
of commercial or sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on v6 yet</font>

811
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,150
yes there are a lot of commercial

812
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,390
implementations so you actually have

813
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:32,460
choices you have some negotiating power

814
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,470
and in most<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases because of the way</font>

815
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,000
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did things initially there was very</font>

816
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,620
little logging which meant that the law

817
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,400
enforcement folks that very picky about

818
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,299
that part of si GN also is they over

819
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,950
build enough that has the capacity

820
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,330
actually watch all of that stuff and

821
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,850
track all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the state and log all of</font>

822
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:51,750
that stuff so you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pass</font>

823
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:53,339
most of the security stuff and you can

824
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,320
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with one too many if you want</font>

825
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:59,330
some will actually do weird stuff with

826
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,380
trying to obscure client addresses

827
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:05,100
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the box you may still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

828
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,620
some logging issues the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

829
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,140
that you will still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

833
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,670
there's a bar see that came out quite

834
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:23,100
recently where some folks at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rogers and</font>

835
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,960
elsewhere did some testing and not

terribly shockingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> with they discover</font>

837
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,440
was all the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were broken in</font>

838
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:30,210
that v4 are still broken in nat and v6

839
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,060
in the same ways for all the same

840
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:35,490
reasons so gaming voice over IP and very

843
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,580
stateful firewall you can get the lack

of visibility the operational complexity

845
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,610
the resource exhaustion problems in the

performance problems that you've come to

847

know and love they will all still be

00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,710
there for your enjoyment it's not really

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,150
servers lying

853
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:08,240
it breaks the in a sec because DNS SEC

854
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,010
is there to prevent people from rewrite

855
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,250
who your DNS answers before they give

856
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:17,900
them to you in theory you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> put your</font>

857
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:19,940
private key on or do something heinous

858
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,130
with lying or other things but

859
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:26,960
effectively what most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

860
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:30,350
implementations do is if you say do bit

861
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,869
I want DNS SEC as the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it</font>

862
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">is signed coming in they will not lie</font>

863
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:36,680
you have to do something deliberately

864
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,390
where there's a flag that<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually says</font>

865
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,960
something like breaks DNS SEC so you're

866
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:44,629
aware of that issue for<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or for</font>

867
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,240
worse since DNS SEC deployment is even

868
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,770
less prevalent than ipv6 I'm not sure

869
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:54,770
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an issue it will be for most</font>

870
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:57,170
of you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunneling so in the same way</font>

871
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:58,670
that you know you could you look at

872
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,320
these transition technologies and you

873
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:05,180
look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF and go please stop</font>

874
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:08,450
helping me quite so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft was</font>

875
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:12,319
actually very active in v6 very early

876
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:15,740
they had the earliest v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax of any</font>

877
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:18,859
client or host they had the most RFC

878
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,299
compliant and they were the best about

879
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:23,540
fixing things when they were broken

880
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:26,480
earliest which and I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bash</font>

881
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:28,730
Microsoft so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a concession</font>

882
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">on my part where they were a little less</font>

883
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:33,770
fun was in their usual Microsoft way

884
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,920
they decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

885
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,660
diving in you know once once that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

886
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,790
flavor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> kool aid they like you will be</font>

887
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">drinking the kool-aid and so they came</font>

888
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with their own transition</font>

889
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:46,310
technologies because the ITF had not yet

890
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,660
gotten on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwagon and they had</font>

891
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:50,359
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorts of things that are on by</font>

default<font color="#CCCCCC"> aissa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tap is one of those</font>

893
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:56,859
interesting little technologies so

894
00:41:54,250 --> 00:42:01,600
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it allows you to do is</font>

895
00:41:56,859 --> 00:42:05,779
have either dual stack or even v6 only

896
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:11,540
clients and you use some intermediate

897
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:15,170
box as a tunnel endpoint gateway for you

898
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,670
and when you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send me sick stuff</font>

899
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:20,480
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just send it through</font>

900
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:23,990
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I so top router can be dual</font>

901
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:28,010

911
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:59,390
over a v4 connection it is however easy

912
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:02,868
to exploit one of the things that

913
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:04,368
Microsoft did is by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're</font>

that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the IP address of your ISO</font>

of your v6 stuff over that box now kind

<font color="#E5E5E5">of cool but I'm a bad person and my</font>

932
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:09,720
person will call my laptop i SAT appt

and I will get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the network and I</font>

934
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:16,589
will use my 18 credentials and it will

935

happily do the ddns updates and use<font color="#E5E5E5"> GS</font>

937
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,130
it's me saying I'm I sit have except now

938
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:29,670
i am a gateway router that everyone in

939
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:31,560
the company will use and I can do

940
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:35,340
whatever I want to those packets for

941
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:38,480
anything v6 it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also does expose because</font>

942
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:42,390
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works is it actually takes</font>

943
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:46,470
your v4 address and just munch is some

944
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:50,850
stuff in front of it even<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1918 or in</font>

945
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:54,450
this case a pip addresses so you know

946
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:56,009
what the v4 address of that box is you

947
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,230
may or may not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to route a packet</font>

948
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:00,750
to it but you as the bad guy have gotten

949
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:05,900
additional information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company</font>

950
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:08,070
probably didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want you to have Torito</font>

951
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,470
another one that Microsoft went through

952
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:13,940
though they actually did get it through

953
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:17,790
the standards process to some extent and

954
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:23,630
again it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those there is some</font>

00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:28,590
well that hotel probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have a</font>

964
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:46,980
that Microsoft has including some stuff

00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:50,310
that uses ipsec secured encrypted

<font color="#E5E5E5">is if I somewhere that is at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

971
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:10,680
my client to use that I actually build a

tunnel that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> invisible to this NAT</font>

973
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:17,710
device punches through all of those and

974
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:21,400
I can have a v6 tunnel

975
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:22,990
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can layer IPSec and send</font>

things IPSec encrypted through that

977
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,759
tunnel and I have a secure connection

978
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:29,589
everywhere and there's no complexity for

979
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,000
the user because they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AV</font>

00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,990
extra flags on that say by the way when

they announced recently that they are

in the next several years this will not

pull this stuff down and then what

1047
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:48,339
happens is you register with 6x and you

1048
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:52,118
can configure a tunnel where you use a

1049
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:54,100
login and password credential regardless

1052
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,859
I have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what IP address he will</font>

1053
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,830
see when I actually make my connection

1054
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:07,359
to his box to open my tunnel the way he

1055
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:09,850
decides that whatever that address

1056
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,830
appears to be is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open that tunnel</font>

1057
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:14,970
to is by the fact that i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that log</font>

1058
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:18,369
in a password now the cool thing is that

1059
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:20,709
he routes a / 48 to that tunnel whenever

1060
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:24,070
it's up and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works from whatever</font>

1061
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:25,650
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm on so I now have native v6</font>

1062
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:27,970
at my home<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I moved to Colorado</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get it</font>

1064
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:34,689
but when I travel I can use in anything

1065
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,130
in anything tunnel and I can have these

1066
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,710
tix connectivity in my hotel room

1067
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:41,410
because in similarly trick to trade<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

1068
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:43,750
since it doesn't use standard tunneling

1069
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:47,470
they don't block it and I can get

1070
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:49,690
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I can have a / 48 in my</font>

1071
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:51,910
hotel room and as long as I do not bring

1072
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:54,430
more than 64,000 subnets worth of

1073
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:57,759
objects with me and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry-on I have</font>

1074
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:59,740
enough address space cool thing is that

1075
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,090
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will punch through firewalls and all</font>

1076
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,859
the rest so you can use when you travel

1077
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:04,510
I love using it for labs for the same

1078
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:06,460
reason hotels and<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference basis</font>

1079
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:08,730
frequently will give bizarre

1080
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,720
connectivity or do unpleasant things

1081
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:12,280
absolute worst case i know that in

1082
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,430
anything into anything tunnel will get

1083
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:18,010
out there the client side is open source

1084
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:21,940
the server is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not but the client side is</font>

1085
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:24,040
an open source problem is it is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

1086
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:29,619
source project there is no commercial

1087
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:33,490
support and 6x gets donated hardware so

1088
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:38,349
the penalty in latency because it is it

1089
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:41,609
is slower hardware when I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be for</font>

1090
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:44,589
pain my gateway from Nevada to Phoenix

1091
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:46,359
which is where my Gateway was I would

1092
00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:49,089
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 millisecond round trip</font>

1093
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:51,339
times if I ping<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 through that tunnel</font>

1094
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:52,540
between the exact same two boxes because

1095
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:54,730
it had to go through the tunneling

1096
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:57,130
software and all of the CPU stack and

1097
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:59,200
all of the other on his gear I usually

1098
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:02,320
took about a 70 80 millisecond panel<font color="#CCCCCC"> t</font>

1099
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:06,790
on all packets so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not ideal for</font>

1100
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:09,190
production and it's a hard-coded end if

1101
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,250
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens i lose my password or</font>

1102
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:14,980
someone else gets my login and password

1103
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:16,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that works so not ideal with production</font>

1104
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:24,359
is an interesting lab or personal

1105
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:27,310
technique<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an RFC and</font>

1106
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:30,549
basically what you do is you statically

1107
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:32,589
configure to ipv4 endpoints as the two

1108
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:36,010
ends of the tunnel and then the v6

1109
00:52:32,589 --> 00:52:41,250
clients who put their v6 packets in v4

1110
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:43,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">six and four will point at that gateway</font>

1111
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,579
this one actually does implement a

1112
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:49,439
protocol number in the same way the GRE

1113
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:52,299
tunnels or protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> number 39 or 40</font>

1114
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,440
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually is an ipv6 transition</font>

1115
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:59,440
tunnel number assigned by I can protocol

1116
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,960
number 41 so if you decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

1117
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,089
want people doing six and four on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1118
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,589
site this is actually one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those where</font>

1119
00:53:04,089 --> 00:53:09,849
you can actually filter because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

1120
00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:14,440
a protocol number it does work through

1121
00:53:09,849 --> 00:53:16,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">nat more or less and it's fairly tight</font>

1122
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,900
header so the odds are good that it

1123
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:21,220
doesn't fragment I the total payload in

1124
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,780
addition to the actual packet you're

1125
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:25,558
sending is something on the order of 20

1126
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:28,869
bytes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the odds are pretty good that</font>

1127
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:31,150
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will not actually have to fragment</font>

1128
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:35,069
most of the time particularly you're

1129
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:37,690
staying in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1480 or less packet size</font>

1130
00:53:35,069 --> 00:53:39,609
the drawback is that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the way</font>

1131
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,650
they do it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their tunneling lack of</font>

00:53:39,609 --> 00:53:44,770
encryption various other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things um it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not overly secure if someone can get</font>

1134
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:50,500
into the Pathan or can somehow inject

1135
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:52,000
packets so certainly any UDP based use

1136
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,450
of the tunnel should be considered

1137
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,290
untrusted so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

1138
00:53:55,450 --> 00:54:02,790
examples of tunneling technologies now

1139
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:02,790
let's talk about encapsulation

1140
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:11,200
six two four and six<font color="#CCCCCC"> are d which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1141
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:14,680
specialized implementation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 624 is the</font>

1142
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:17,950
most common one you'll see and again

1143
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:23,560
what happens is essentially you discover

1144
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:26,790
a relay that will get your<font color="#CCCCCC"> v four</font>

1145
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">packets out</font>

1146
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:36,848
the use public IP space as the transport

1147
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:43,149
you can glue these six clouds this way

1148
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:45,970
and it will work it is different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a</font>

1149
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:50,829
tunnel only<font color="#E5E5E5"> in because these endpoints</font>

1150
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:53,078
can change the nice thing is that unlike

1151
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:55,299
some other encapsulation schemes because

1152
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:58,390
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still chucking it to the nearest</font>

1153
00:54:55,299 --> 00:55:00,579
router that you have found you don't

1154
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:02,440
have to change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client so the clients</font>

1155
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:06,489
tax will still simply spit packets and

1156
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:11,729
it will work it is transparent the

1157
00:55:06,489 --> 00:55:14,529
problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can't control</font>

1158
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:16,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">what package your clients send out and</font>

1159
00:55:14,529 --> 00:55:18,039
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to gate with other than</font>

1160
00:55:16,509 --> 00:55:19,299
yours or you didn't do gateways and

1161
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:23,259
they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> using whatever gateway</font>

1162
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:24,700
happens to be lying around you don't

1163
00:55:23,259 --> 00:55:26,349
know where those packets are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1164
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:29,339
you don't know who is doing that

1165
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:32,039
encapsulation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> D capsulation for you</font>

1166
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:35,200
so aside from the security implications

1167
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:36,819
there's also again it's the if you're

1168
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,259
hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that somebody upstream from you</font>

1169
00:55:36,819 --> 00:55:43,349
did a better job of designing the

1170
00:55:38,259 --> 00:55:52,900
network than you did as your design

1171
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:54,989
update your resume yeah comcast when

1172
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:58,420
they were initially rolling out v6

1173
00:55:54,989 --> 00:56:00,999
didn't have the code in all of their CMT

00:56:33,759 --> 00:56:38,170
up to like 40 percent packet loss on

normal circumstances<font color="#CCCCCC"> Comcast did a</font>

1188
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,850
better job

1189
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:43,820
engineering but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the problem really</font>

1190
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:45,529
is that it's essentially punting<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1191
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:48,820
problem to someone else with no control

1192
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:51,230
over your user experience or debugging

1193
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:54,530
one of the other experiments out there

1194
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:57,380
was dual stack light and a specialized

1195
00:56:54,530 --> 00:57:01,100
implementation of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> after again</font>

1196
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:03,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Comcast they had gotten to the stage</font>

1197
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:06,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">where they they were using that 10 as</font>

1198
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,960
their customer aggregation fabric

1199
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:11,870
between the cpes and head ends and the

1200
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,090
actual real core routers they had gotten

1201
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:17,319
to the stage of growth where they were

1202
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:20,300
on the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe was their third net 10</font>

1203
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,820
so they had to have three sets of

1204
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,740
network monitoring tools and three sets

1205
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:26,630
of glass and hope that they're not

1206
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,770
remembered which of the three net10

1207
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:31,250
addresses it was when they were

1208
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:35,540
debugging and they knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was just</font>

1209
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:37,250
batshit crazy so they said what we

1210
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,070
should really do is figure out a way to

1211
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:44,540
do this so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push v6 out</font>

1212
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:47,300
all the way to the customer and upgrade

1213
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,740
our backbone to be 6 and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1214
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:53,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do dual stack and all of that</font>

1215
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:56,629
overhead so the architecture that what

1216
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,910
they came up with was<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and basically</font>

1217
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:03,560
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is clients can be either</font>

1218
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:07,430
dual stack or<font color="#E5E5E5"> soar single protocol but</font>

1219
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:09,680
the cpe that's in the house called the

1220
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:14,839
before they have fun that weekend with

1221
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:18,799
beers takes care of taking that stuff

1222
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:23,579
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's v6 it simply ships it off to</font>

1223
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:26,099
the after box over a tunnel

1224
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:27,660
and that box spits it out to the v6

1225
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:29,759
internet and it is more or less native

1226
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:33,239
there's very little overhead there is no

1227
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:36,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">NAT taking place nothing else is</font>

1228
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:38,039
happening to it if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is before it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

1229
00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:40,709
actually stick that into a tunnel

1230
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:43,349
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> v4 device in the after</font>

1231
00:58:40,709 --> 00:58:46,399
device it will encapsulate here it will

1232
00:58:43,349 --> 00:58:49,739
d capsulate there now one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

1233
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:52,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it potentially if</font>

1234
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:54,269
you don't need to use 1918 space down

1235
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:56,969
here be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure have enough public address</font>

1236
00:58:54,269 --> 00:59:01,288
space in<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could actually not</font>

1237
00:58:56,969 --> 00:59:04,229
have Mac here in v4 only encapsulation

1238
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:06,150
to get it from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> before device to the</font>

1239
00:59:04,229 --> 00:59:10,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">after device now what they wind up doing</font>

1240
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:12,989
was of course a gnat box because they

1241
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:16,709
they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have enough public address</font>

1242
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:20,670
space to do this but at least they had

1243
00:59:16,709 --> 00:59:22,558
the option of separating out NAT from

1244
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:26,249
encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

1245
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:28,199
example where you have two things so at

1246
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:31,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point down here if you're doing</font>

1247
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:34,259
that you now have added<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the list of</font>

1248
00:59:31,229 --> 00:59:36,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that NAT breaks and across here</font>

1249
00:59:34,259 --> 00:59:38,729
you have the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

1250
00:59:36,089 --> 00:59:43,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">can capsulation potentially breaks so</font>

1251
00:59:38,729 --> 00:59:46,430
now you know what the trade-offs are all

1252
00:59:43,469 --> 00:59:49,589
you have to do is figure out this

1253
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:51,690
particular implementation does these two

1254
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:53,339
of the three possible choices and you

1255
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:56,069
now understand your trade offs and risks

1256
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:58,078
and one of the good things was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1257
00:59:56,069 --> 01:00:02,489
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do dual stack or v6 only</font>

1258
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,259
or v4 only at the house so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the</font>

1259
01:00:02,489 --> 01:00:05,849
tvs and toasters and all the other

1260
01:00:04,259 --> 01:00:08,130
crusty that we all have around our

1261
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:13,019
house that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will never get upgraded will</font>

1262
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:15,390
still work and it had commercial support

1263
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:18,448
in that they commissioned is see the

1264
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:21,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys who write bind and dhcp to right</font>

1265
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:24,569
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the before stack and they were</font>

1266
01:00:21,779 --> 01:00:26,640
actually easy with the open wrt and so

1267
01:00:24,569 --> 01:00:31,380
they were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get commercial support</font>

1268
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:33,299
for it and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to nap if you</font>

1269
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,519
had enough before<font color="#E5E5E5"> address space for all</font>

1270
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:36,200
of the things behind the cpe you could

1271
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:38,930
actually choose

1272
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:42,410
not to that of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

1273
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:45,169
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it though was on multiple</font>

1274
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:47,390
layers you now have a virtual fabric

1275

versus physical fabric for your customer

1276
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:51,770
aggregation portion you still have an

01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:01,339
multiple boxes all of which are stomping

1281
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:04,430
on packets difficult for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your knock and</font>

1282
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:06,049
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to replace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that CPE because you</font>

1283
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:09,649
need something that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually run</font>

1284
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:12,230
open wrt which is relatively inexpensive

1285
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:15,140
if you look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from an operating</font>

1286
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:17,450
system but when the reason that CPE suck

1287
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:21,200
is because they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1288
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:23,779
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 75 cents worth of parts and pay</font>

1289
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:26,569
some grad student a couple hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> bucks</font>

1290
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:29,210
to write a DHCP server and a DNS

1291
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:31,700
resolver and then they can sell them at

1292
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:33,380
five bucks apiece to the ISPs who can

1293
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:36,439
selling the customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 and</font>

1294
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:39,920
everybody's happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have 75 cents</font>

1295
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,780
worth of value and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point that</font>

1296
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,720
they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do cheap out enough that you</font>

1297
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:46,730
actually can't load dubbin wrt in most

1298
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,618
cases so suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually have to</font>

1299
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:52,250
get into god forbid<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ten or fifteen</font>

1300
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:55,280
dollar actual cost router and you need

1301
01:01:52,250 --> 01:02:01,490
to get them to replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it one of the</font>

1302
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:05,869
other ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did was map e which</font>

1303
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:08,479
is mapping address and port pairs<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco</font>

1304
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:11,030
started this because what they wanted

1305
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:14,810
was something that was relatively

1306
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:18,079
stateless and had less overhead than a

1307
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:20,630
classic CGN or nat64 because they felt

1308
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,910
that that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> logging</font>

1309
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:25,400
was problematic and so their solution

1310
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:27,078
rather than trying to just build big ass

1311
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,720
boxes that were grossly over engineered

1312
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:31,579
which is basically how they did CGN was

1313
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:34,368
they said let's try and do a protocol to

1314
01:02:31,579 --> 01:02:36,200
make this actually more sane and then

1315
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:39,380
basically again what happens is you

1316
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:41,660
create these tunnels over which you send

1317
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:46,250
your v6 packets so that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have v6</font>

1318
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:48,890
clouds traversing over a v4 fabric now

1319
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:49,999
the cool thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is relatively</font>

1320
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:53,209
stateless

1321
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:55,399
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the interesting things</font>

1322
01:02:53,209 --> 01:02:57,078
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did was they said well that</font>

1323
01:02:55,399 --> 01:03:00,529
address plus port which is really what

1324
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:01,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need a nap I don't want to do it in</font>

1325
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:05,599
the big expensive device because that's

1326
01:03:01,969 --> 01:03:07,279
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you exhaust your cgm box you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1327
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,979
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> state for lots and lots of</font>

1328
01:03:07,279 --> 01:03:12,109
customers all the time lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of memory</font>

1329
01:03:09,979 --> 01:03:14,239
lots of some form for assistance storage

resource exhaustion problems all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1331
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,769
rest of it if all you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is you're</font>

1332
01:03:16,539 --> 01:03:20,509
basically ripping something off and

1333
01:03:18,769 --> 01:03:23,238
sticking something else on and shoveling

1334
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:24,859
it through that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast and if</font>

1335
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:27,289
what you're ripping off and putting back

1336
01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:30,169
on actually includes its own state so

1337
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:32,479
you don't have to pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

1338
01:03:30,169 --> 01:03:35,689
box can be much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple and it can</font>

1339
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:37,218
fit in the ACA and the cpe which has a

1340
01:03:35,689 --> 01:03:38,899
much lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic load because it's</font>

only<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one house as amount of traffic</font>

1342
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:46,629
and packets can actually do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

1343
01:03:42,229 --> 01:03:50,868
in port mapping<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok clever idea I'm</font>

1344
01:03:46,629 --> 01:03:53,239
interesting but logging<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still</font>

1345
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:55,339
sometimes a problem depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how you</font>

1346
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:58,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">choose to do it and whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

1347
01:03:55,339 --> 01:04:01,509
algorithmically derived mapping of

1348
01:03:58,759 --> 01:04:04,729
address to who had it at the time is

1349
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:09,349
satisfactory for your privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

back to you have to replace the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cds</font>

where am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what do I have what</font>

the protocols and you go across and

01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:39,540
two streams which is always fun because

01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">we know what happens we cross the</font>

01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:52,710
my particular problem in this instance

1386
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:56,130
in this place in this time will suck

1387
01:05:52,710 --> 01:06:01,800
less and that's pretty much as good as

1388
01:05:56,130 --> 01:06:04,020
it gets I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> afraid so right now CGN is</font>

1389
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,940
being used pretty heavily by a lot of

1390

the telcos and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellular's for new</font>

1391
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,680
projects it's starting to get used also

1392
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:12,299
by some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data center and cloud</font>

01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:15,180
providers as well and it's all for the

1394
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:17,520
same reason these are large numbers of

1395

01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:42,180
specialized way of how you have those

buy that comcast said would work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1415
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:20,100
plugged it in and I had a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> apple</font>

1416
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,450
airport express because it was small I

1417
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,299
figured that would get my phone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1418
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:26,970
tablet<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my laptop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all up and I would</font>

1419
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:30,660
have v6 and v4 what I discovered was

1420
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:34,830
Apple actually didn't do dhcpv6

1421
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:37,589
correctly so as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

1422
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:39,890
apple airport express i wound up finding

1423
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:42,420
there were still six to four gateways on

1424
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:44,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">Comcast as soon as I actually got a</font>

1425
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:48,390
decent router that actually had a decent

1426
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:51,600
code stack which was not made by apple I

1427
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:55,230
had native v6 so they are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1428
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:57,210
there Japan swisscom who recently went

1429
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:59,100
up other people have used this as a

1430
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:00,600
stepping stone and again like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said in</font>

1431
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,920
that case what's happening is they

1432
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,150
weren't depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the up streams they</font>

1433
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,800
were providing their own gateways to

1434
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:06,450
have at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least some control over the</font>

1435
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:10,920
experience but it has all those

1436
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:14,509
trade-offs and the ITF let's let's chat

1437
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,510
for a minute about the ITF so

1438
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:18,930
they're all these transition

1439
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:20,790
technologies and they all evolved

1440
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:24,300
quickly cleanly and easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you as you</font>

1441
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:25,680
can see from this slide this is sort of

1442
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the history</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of all of the little bits</font>

1443
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,190
and you can't actually read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> well on</font>

1444
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:31,019
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you download the slides</font>

1445
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:37,799
later on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little things up who is</font>

1446
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:40,130
using it where<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is what we're</font>

1447
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,130
left with

1448
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:46,300
and from this it's quite parent such as

1449
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:48,910
the ITF of which transition technologies

1450
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:51,540
are appropriate for you when i first

1451
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:55,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">started trying to teach and using this</font>

1452
01:08:51,540 --> 01:09:00,580
that was basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the genesis of this</font>

1453
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:02,890
talk because my brain exploded and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go</font>

1454
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:06,189
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF and I have involved on these</font>

1455
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:09,070
working groups and these lists and I

1456
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:12,689
couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember which one was which</font>

1457
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:15,309
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those classic stories so</font>

1458
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:17,410
originally map was proposed by Cisco and

1459
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:18,880
they had two possible ways of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font>

1460
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:21,880
one of which was it with encapsulation

1461
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:26,200
one of which was with tunneling there

1462
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:29,650
was more enthusiasm for<font color="#CCCCCC"> encapsulation so</font>

1463
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:33,429
that got the standards track craft and

1464
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">map</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T was done as experimental but as</font>

1465
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:37,150
happens with engineers who spend time

1466
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:38,349
testing working writing code and

1467
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:41,319
implementations and all the rest of it

1468
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:44,800
we all become very emotionally invested

1469
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:46,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">in our solution as the correct one now</font>

1470
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,180
the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that functionally</font>

1471
01:09:46,569 --> 01:09:52,000
speaking they were pretty much the same

1472
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:54,250
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could actually show you the</font>

1473
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,960
pictures of where it fractionally

1474
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:59,560
changes exactly where in the software

1475
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:02,800
stack you add and delete the wrapping

1476
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:04,870
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically it's identical and they</font>

1477
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,360
finally after multiple years got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1478
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:09,220
point where both of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them agreed that yes</font>

1479
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,530
they were functionally equivalent and

1480
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:14,080
that either one had all of the same

1481
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:16,530
advantages and disadvantages but neither

1482
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:20,350
one wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that went away</font>

1483
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:22,440
so they did the only sane sound

1484
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:26,250
technological thing that they could do

1485
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:26,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">they flipped a coin</font>

1486
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:35,660
and map e 1 so oh that's the yeah has

1487
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:37,100
the various so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a lot of these are</font>

1488
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:39,260
actually done they are deployed or

1489
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:44,150
deployable some of them are still being

1490
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:50,150
developed and that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even touch</font>

1491
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:52,670
mobility<font color="#E5E5E5"> now working groups I would</font>

1492
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:54,769
encourage you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very fun for</font>

1493
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:58,280
me and very easy to take potshots at the

1494
01:10:54,770 --> 01:11:00,020
IETF and say that they are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

1495
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:02,000
ivory tower folks who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care</font>

1496
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:05,989
about our<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerns and what breaks for</font>

1497
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,460
us and the ITF when you go to them and

1498
01:11:05,989 --> 01:11:09,230
say you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys don't take</font>

1499
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:10,940
operational input they<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in our know we</font>

1500
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:13,759
are a completely open process anyone can

1501
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:16,759
come and everybody is equal so if you

1502
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,410
have concerns you should come in and of

1503
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">course if you then do that the reality</font>

1504
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:21,980
is is that there is a whole culture that

1505
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:23,719
you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> overcome and you should be</font>

1506
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:27,589
prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a very thick skin and a</font>

1507
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:30,890
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> patience but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they are actually</font>

1508
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:34,070
correct and so one of the things I do is

1509
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:37,850
I try to be fair on both sides you

1510
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:42,170
should go to the ITF if you can at least

1511
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:44,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">once a year and while it is not quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1512
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:45,890
effective the myth although is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1513
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:47,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to actually go if you simply</font>

1514
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:50,300
participate on the mailing list it is it

1515
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:51,739
fully as functional it's not quite but

1516
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:55,429
it is ninety ninety-five percent

1517
01:11:51,739 --> 01:11:57,919
functional so if you can't go subscribe

1518
01:11:55,429 --> 01:11:59,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the mailing list post on the mailing</font>

1519
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,179
list give them your comments give them

1520
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:07,310
your feedback we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one to blame</font>

1521
01:12:02,179 --> 01:12:08,840
but ourselves if we did nothing and they

1522
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:11,570
give us crap that doesn't solve our

1523
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:14,449
problems now if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we give them input and</font>

1524
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:18,230
they choose to ignore it we have to push

1525
01:12:14,449 --> 01:12:21,919
harder but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least we are trying to</font>

1526
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:23,570
move the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process and so these are some</font>

1527
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggestions for some of the ones that I</font>

1528
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:26,750
think are probably more relevant to this

1529
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:29,449
group at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> because v6 is</font>

1530
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:31,100
becoming so prevalent in everything when

1531
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:32,629
I go to the ITF now I actually usually

1532
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:34,429
have to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten to eleven different</font>

1533
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:37,760
working groups because they all somehow

1534
01:12:34,429 --> 01:12:39,110
touch v6 but the reality is is that in

1535
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,860
this case these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the ones</font>

1536
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:42,889
that are most relevant

1537
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:45,019
and soft wire is it's the SoftWIRE it's

1538
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:46,400
not a physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> wider so these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

1539
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:50,180
the encapsulation and tunneling

1540
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,679
technologies so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1541
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:53,990
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than say please stop</font>

1542
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:57,050
helping us to so much if we see another

1543
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:59,990
v6 transition technology we will kill

1544
01:12:57,050 --> 01:13:03,470
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay software is the group to come</font>

1545
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:06,320
and say that they do all of those sunset

1546
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:10,250
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the how do we start turning off v4</font>

1547
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">over time so eventually it's mostly gone</font>

1548
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:14,660
what are the problems we're going to hit

1549
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:19,340
as we try and do more and more with v6

1550
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:22,790
and v6 only six man is the actual this

1551
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the actual protocol the actual ipv6</font>

1552
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:27,470
and eh actually now that I'm DHCP it

1553
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:29,210
touches that but all of these things

1554
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:31,100
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what's in an extension</font>

1555
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:33,110
header this is how an address is

1556
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:34,880

actually needs to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol is</font>

01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:45,380
that that's not what we need to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

1568
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:05,179
in theory the operational group this

these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people that are using v6 in</font>

operational environment and have

1571
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:12,500
operational concerns it is more

1572
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:15,190
operational than six band and there are

1573
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:17,750
people in v6 ops who really are clued

1574
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:21,559
but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are enough ideologues who</font>

right across the concept of Ulan versus

you are correct a system programs

01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:09,349
right so for the webcast folks the

1602
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:10,599
question basically boils down to ula

1603
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:13,190
addresses or unique local addresses

1604
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:19,640
versus global unicast or publicly

1605
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:21,169
routable addresses to some degree this

1606
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:25,550
is my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

1607

do debate this in the ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not to</font>

1608
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:31,580
completely agree with me but first of

1609
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:35,150
all what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is not it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not designed</font>

stateful firewall address space to

1617
01:16:52,310 --> 01:17:00,170
transition until we got to v6 ula was

1618
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:03,650
actually designed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connected</font>

1619
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:06,950
this is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nets not that are NAT adore</font>

1620
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:09,710
firewall but that are completely

1621
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:14,660
unconnected a much better analogy would

1622
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:16,730
be the epitome<font color="#E5E5E5"> for addresses that would</font>

1623
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:19,010
be what they were conceptually used for

1624
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:22,519
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course is that you</font>

1625
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:27,230
can use NAT PT or NAT and use them like

1626
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:31,640
you would use 1918 spaces but my

1627
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:35,000
contention is it's much like thickening

1628
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rating of firewall you still don't</font>

1629
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,690
have a fireproof wall you have the same

1630
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:45,830
problems but you've increased the amount

1631
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:49,849
of time before you burn and can't get

1632
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:54,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">out they are not guaranteed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be unique</font>

1633
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:58,070
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still potentially have the</font>

1634
01:17:54,410 --> 01:18:01,970
problem of collisions when you combine

1635
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:03,559
networks from different companies 6x is

1636
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:06,020
doing a registration process where you

1637
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:08,780
can have it randomly generate a ul a

1638
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:10,160
prefix and then it won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give that out</font>

1639
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:13,340
again so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">your ula is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unique you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do that but</font>

1641
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:16,070
that's a myth because it's not

1642
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,990
guaranteed unique it's guaranteed unique

1643

among all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font>

1644
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:22,450
people who know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 6x and have chosen</font>

1645
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:24,490
to use that and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people use 1918</font>

1646
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:26,410
space because they don't want you to

1647
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:28,150
know what their addresses are so they

1648
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:33,580
certainly aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to register those</font>

1649
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:35,309
with 6x and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the one too</font>

1650
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:39,760
many problems stateful firewall so

1651
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:41,890
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> my recommendation is if you</font>

1652
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,950
don't understand all of the complexities

1653
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:46,390
and have a decided need for which you

1654
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:49,929
will never have collisions renumber

1655
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:51,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ang's or connectivity issues and that's</font>

1656
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:54,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem you're trying to solve then</font>

1657
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">ula may be reasonable if you are not</font>

1658
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,690
absolutely positive and do not feel like

1659
01:18:56,620 --> 01:19:02,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why you should use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

then<font color="#E5E5E5"> dua is the answer the one example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1661
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,620

1662
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:08,320
we are getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> port where there are</font>

1663
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:10,240
networks with cars you know my car has

1664
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:13,330
so much stuff in it that I actually have

1665
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:17,800
multiple subnets in my car and I Drive

1666
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:21,250
it to the dealer and they plug it into a

1667
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,750
diagnostic machine you really don't want

1668
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,010
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to reconfigure that test harness</font>

1669
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:26,020
it would be nice to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1670
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:29,500
carburetor was always 10 dot one dot one

1671
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:32,770
dot one you obviously can't connect two

1672
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:34,120
cars together but you never would it's

1673
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:35,290
certainly never supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to</font>

1674
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,790
the internet because you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1675
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:39,280
want people on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet talking to</font>

1676
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:40,870
your carburetor so in that case it's the

1677
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,280
it should never be connected and it

1678
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:43,960
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter that every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single one of</font>

them that comes in is the same that's

1680
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,440
actually a feature so to me that's

01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:52,660
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only good use case I've</font>

something I've seen that I've always had

1718
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:45,030
a question about is the use of ipv6

1719

addresses on point-to-point links like

1720

on ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically has / 30 or 31 yes but</font>

1722
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:56,639
tried to specify a standard for v6 that

1723
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:57,900
stated that it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a / 64 then</font>

1727
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:11,760
is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 127 you can use</font>

holes open for some of the problems that

are various<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping-pong and routing loop</font>

01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:19,140
and other attacks where you can

1732
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:20,730
essentially melt the point-to-point link

1733
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,590
by getting a packet in and things bounce

1734
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:24,120
back and forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you spend all of your</font>

supposed to be in the point-to-point so

1738
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:32,490
originally there was a push for

1739
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:34,290
everything should be a 64 all subnet

1740

<font color="#CCCCCC">soon matter how many including things</font>

1741
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:39,450
with only two possible hosts and don't

1742
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:42,060
worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about wasting the address space</font>

1743
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:44,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">people started saying there no we should</font>

1744
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:46,650
really use 127 s to not waste address

1746
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:52,049
yes I may find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an offensive waste</font>

1747

1751
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:07,920
RFC is used of 127 what I say is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

1752
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:09,570
you like the provisioning joy of being

able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a 64 to everything and that</font>

1754
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:15,719
works for your provisioning system you

1755
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:18,960
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> assign a 64 to the link but</font>

1756
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:21,870
configure a 127 the disadvantage with

1757
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,730
that is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime along the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way if you</font>

provisioning some network engineer is

1760
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:29,040
going to go oh that's the sixty-four for

1761
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:29,970
this link they aren't going to think and

1762
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:33,350
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually configure it</font>

1763
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:35,550
as a 64 and that link<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be vulnerable</font>

1764
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:37,190
the alternate which is actually what I

1765
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:40,320
would normally think of doing anyways

1766
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:41,160
basically you do 127 s4 point2 points

1767
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,809
and 128

1768
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:46,620
loop backs in the same way that you do

1769
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:50,250
31<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 32 s in v4 and what you do is for</font>

1770
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:53,790
each single ASI outing domain contiguous

1771
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:56,160
routing domain you assign a 64 for loop

1772
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:58,170
backs and you assign a 64 for point2

1773
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:00,480
points the nice thing is then you can do

1774
01:23:58,170 --> 01:24:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">ackles because most permissions that you</font>

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to enable or things you'd</font>

1776
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:05,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to monitor all your point2 points</font>

1777
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,799
are probably the same within<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

1778
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:09,900
routing domain it<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means that you</font>

1779
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,840
can have one single aklefur allow this

1780

64<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ssh and 42 and from your network</font>

1781

1782
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:19,980
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do stress one routing domain if</font>

1783
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:23,040
you actually have discontiguous space

1784
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:25,799
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will need a slash 64 for each for</font>

1786
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,460
those two styles will tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work for</font>

1787
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:33,360
most people most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who do more land</font>

1788
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:36,240
and more host space will like the 64

1789
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:38,190
with configure the 127 more often most

1790
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:40,469
people who do backbone and don't tend to

1791
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:42,900
deal with edges much and and actually do

1792
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:50,240
127 and 128 will tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go that</font>

1793
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:50,240
direction thank you sure other questions

01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:53,990
ok that's it

Alex let's go server central one thing

1796
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:03,050
that was driving me slightly crazy now

01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:07,100
when cleaning up legacies those

1798
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:09,440
benighted sots decided oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can add v6</font>

1799
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:12,680
i'll just add family v62<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe GP</font>

1800
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:16,370
connection and throw the v4 address into

1803
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:29,680
it's being fun yes there are a lot of

bad habits that we will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to squash</font>
