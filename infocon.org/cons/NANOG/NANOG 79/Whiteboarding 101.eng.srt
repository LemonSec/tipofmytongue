given given that given the format where

16
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:55,249
we're taking here so let me start our

17
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,199
introduce our next bead or mat Ringel is

18
00:00:55,249 --> 00:01:00,079
the senior architect for network

19
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,210
planning at Akamai his primary job is

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,510
giving specific answers to vague

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,180
capacity questions before that he worked

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,800
for Akamai special services group where

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,740
he learned to tell stories with a

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,009
whiteboard and today Matt's going to

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,869
share some Lee's learned on that subject

26
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:21,700
and with that I will introduce Matt

27
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:24,890
Ringgold thank you thank you Chris

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:28,340
so hello my name is Matt Ringgold as

29
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:30,170
Chris said I have done a lot of work

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,940
I've done a lot of work with telling

31
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,730
stories with things in front of me

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,830
typically involving pens and whiteboards

33
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:39,530
but as we know circumstances demand that

34
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,880
we do not have a whiteboard also

35
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,280
lighting a whiteboard is hard

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,140
so instead we're using a virtual

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,360
whiteboard and I get to use a graphics

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,210
tablet and we're going to do this talk

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,220
on how to give a whiteboard talk

40
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:55,330
whiteboarding 101 this is one of my

41
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,900
favorite topics to talk about um so

42
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:02,660
let's just get right into it

43
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:08,989
so the first thing I do aha you see I

44
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:11,540
have another one it's great so if we and

45
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:13,700
so keep in mind this is all live right I

46
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,299
was told never do a live demo well guess

47
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,299
what here we are

48
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:29,959
so hello there

49
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:31,340
hi that's me what is a whiteboard we're

50
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,000
just gonna say WP because we know what

51
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,130
we're talking about so a whiteboard is

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,660
you know any in the end if you want to

53
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,000
get right down to it it is just a

54
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,590
surface you can write on right that you

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,010
can erase on what have you dry erase

56
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,550
markers technology the tricky part is or

57
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:52,370
the best part is what you can do with it

58
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:54,290
because normally when you do a

59
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,180
presentation or PowerPoint stuff you're

60
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,340
presenting and that has its place in

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,769
life but in the case of a whiteboard you

62
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,470
get to tell a story and you get to tell

63
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:06,500
the story live while you're doing it

64
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:10,489
because narrative is incredibly

65
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:14,390
important narrative is stories that's

66
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,800
how humans evolved to you know move to

67
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,958
the top over time that's that's what

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,370
humans do we tell stories to each other

69
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,420
we're able to relay information to each

70
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:27,890
other it's the way that I can get a

71
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,660
thought into your head without surgery I

72
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:34,010
don't think so your surgery would even

73
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,440
work but words language story and with a

74
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,840
whiteboard pictures like this fluffy

75
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,640
cloud and these two stick figures

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,780
represent how we can actually talk with

77
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,760
each other and so given that what do I

78
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,140
also get you know I talk about things

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,530
you get for free things that are easier

80
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,809
to do with the whiteboard right so if

81
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,210
you imagine one of the things we get is

82
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:01,520
um we're talking about real

83
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,530
storytelling but what does that also

84
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:09,650
mean that means real-time organization

85
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:11,690
of data I can put data at a fairly low

86
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:17,090
density on a whiteboard and talk about

87
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:24,290
things there are two apples three

88
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:32,119
oranges and poof I've got a table in

89
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:34,520
addition being able to talk about I put

90
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,940
another way is that so first I can talk

91
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,810
about stories first this happens then

92
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,820
this happens then this happens and then

93
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,030
a new challenger arrives and this

94
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,650
happens and that happens and then we

95
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,969
have a story and you can follow all the

96
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,150
way to the end and this is whether your

97
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,880
audience is ten people or a hundred

98
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,489
where were 300 I've given this talk in

99
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,580
several venues in that regard and you

100
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,350
end up here but the other thing that it

101
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,940
gives you is it gives you a way to tell

102
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,540
data I mean if you think about a comic

103
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,060
book it's a serial novel you have these

104
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,340
pictures and one happens to after the

105
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,310
other taken individually they're just

106
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,400
pictures but putting in order they tell

107
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:23,780
a story and so what we're going to talk

108
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:29,450
about today is how white boards are

109
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:33,140
narrative plus visual organization and

110
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:35,990
how you can use that period ran out of

111
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,330
space so we can actually talk about how

112
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,070
you can get things out to an audience

113
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,900
how you can express things in audience

114
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,740
and this will be what you're trying to

115
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,960
convince somebody to buy your thing

116
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,960
whether it's convincing people to take a

117
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,090
certain technical tack on things whether

118
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,469
it's can sing people not to do a thing

119
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,780
or anything in between but it's about

120
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,910
being able to display your thought in a

121
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,940
way that is easy to get in their head

122
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,770
and one of those thoughts will be how to

123
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,110
give a white board presentation so

124
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:13,058
without further ado let's just start

125
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:16,399
right in so the first thing is

126
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:17,479
you're talking about a story the first

127
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:25,669
thing we're going to talk about is

128
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:28,639
boundaries and by boundaries I mean what

129
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:30,948
are the things you want to talk about

130
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,079
what are the what are the stories you

131
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:34,909
relate it was the store we you want to

132
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,529
tell remembered you've got a whole bunch

133
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:38,509
of people in the room with a whole bunch

134
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,699
of thoughts in their head and it's just

135
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:42,319
you up there armed with a miraculous

136
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,059
device called whiteboard but that's all

137
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,159
you've got so let's do a little bit of

138
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:49,849
planning first shall we so the first

139
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:52,909
thing we're going to think of is so we

140
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:56,389
think of the horizontal boundaries okay

141
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:58,039
so I've got this boundary and this

142
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,239
boundary let's say here is all the

143
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:03,759
thoughts we could possibly have on

144
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:06,739
things so between these two boundaries

145
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,389
note I just had arrows there's lines and

146
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:09,948
now you have a space between two things

147
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,519
you filled that all in yourself we'll

148
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:18,519
get to that later between these two

149
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:20,419
things represents the or you say sorry

150
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:29,149
also nice thing about a whiteboard is

151
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:32,899
you can erase not like that so this new

152
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:34,309
technology for all of us so in fact what

153
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:38,809
we can do is we can say your horizontal

154
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:45,260
boundaries there are your story or your

155
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:47,210
scope this represent

156
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,870
the topic you're going to talk about are

157
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:53,030
you talking about bird-watching are you

158
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,410
talking about the binoculars you use for

159
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,140
bird watching the cameras use for

160
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,340
bird-watching are you talking about

161
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,659
networks as a whole are you talking

162
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,039
about network equipment are you talking

163
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,450
about one specific vendor are you

164
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,470
talking about a bake-off between them

165
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,190
are you talking about binary and

166
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,560
networking what is the topic and how

167
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,780
much of it do you want to cover

168
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,610
obviously the less time you have the

169
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,049
less you get to cover and you've got to

170
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,310
choose the level at which you want to do

171
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,960
it so now you've got your subject matter

172
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,000
lockdown you kind of know what you want

173
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,969
to talk about the other thing you have

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,730
is your vertical boundaries see this is

175
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:28,510
totally vertical and that represents

176
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,510
abstraction

177
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,460
now abstraction in this case means how

178
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,419
deep into the weeds do you want to get

179
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:41,000
in specific are we talking about

180
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,860
something are we giving a survey of a

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,140
topic you know there's no bad or good

182
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,700
answer here are you giving a survey of a

183
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,720
topic where you're just kind of okay

184
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,490
well here's a bunch of different ways

185
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,900
we're not gonna touch on details for any

186
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,700
of them but here's the range of what's

187
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,610
around you know that might be a high

188
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,080
level of abstraction or this is the well

189
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,230
these are the bits you actually have to

190
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,520
twiddle in order to make sure that you

191
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,410
don't have this race condition in this

192
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,939
case with this packet at this time in

193
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,219
order to make sure that this interface

194
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,630
doesn't burst into flames and it's these

195
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,910
specific bits in have a nice day let me

196
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,870
show you the hex editor whether that

197
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,610
will be a pretty low level of

198
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,250
abstraction okay fine

199
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:20,540
now the interesting things about this

200
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:23,870
are so once again horizontal scope

201
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:27,170
verticals abstraction you have to be

202
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,580
very careful about abstraction you can

203
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,420
pretty much decide on the top you're

204
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,650
going to talk about and keep talking

205
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:38,319
about that but the hard part here is if

206
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:41,420
you imagine we're going to put a little

207
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,520
Cartesian action up here and so we're

208
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:48,920
gonna have you know time goes this way

209
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:50,390
and abstraction goes this way now what I

210
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,579
say about vertical boundaries right so

211
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,350
let's say you've chosen that your

212
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,780
abstraction is your level of

213
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,320
abstractions going to be around here

214
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,630
great

215
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,120
so let's put you know a couple of

216
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,620
control boundaries around that this is

217
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,870
hardly quantitative but you'll see what

218
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:12,900
I'm getting at okay so ideally you do

219
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,930
not want your talk to deviate from this

220
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,120
level of abstraction you never want to

221
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:21,329
get big because what happens is if you

222
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:29,340
break out too high it ends up being very

223
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:31,590
very fluffy or hand wavy and that's a

224
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,540
problem because now people like why why

225
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,960
did I waste my time why am I here what

226
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,510
did I do

227
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,430
why why did I even come here I'm not

228
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:41,000
learning anything I've got better things

229
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,000
to do with my time

230
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:54,089
similarly if you break out too low you

231
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:56,610
end up in the weeds or rattling or

232
00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:01,950
choose whatever phrase you like to use

233
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:04,980
for it right um specifically if I go too

234
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,870
far into the details it's not that it's

235
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,430
not interesting number one it might be

236
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,600
interesting to you but that's not the

237
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,189
interesting part you're supposed to be

238
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,750
interesting for other people here your

239
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:17,220
the one challenge a story but also

240
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,100
you've shrunken down your audience it is

241
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:23,580
entirely possible even likely that you

242
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,980
have now only got the attention of one

243
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:30,540
person in a room of ten or a hundred or

244
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:33,510
300 with your one detail if they need to

245
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,829
ask questions that are relevant telling

246
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,270
them hey you know that's a great

247
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,310
question it's a little bit outside the

248
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,490
scope of this discussion I'll be glad to

249
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,989
talk with you I'll offline and similarly

250
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,660
if someone's to ask a very very

251
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,130
high-level question or is asking kind of

252
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,209
a 101 question about something where

253
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,570
you're giving a much more advanced

254
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:54,180
honest I I see where you're coming from

255
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:57,570
I'd like to hold off the overview until

256
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,400
later talk to me afterwards and that's

257
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,350
okay you are there to be available to

258
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,760
tell people but the people in the room

259
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,940
are you need to are the ones you need to

260
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,470
accommodate to the nice thing about

261
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:11,790
boundaries is that this becomes a really

262
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:13,860
interesting self check because you

263
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,719
actually you know while you're talking

264
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,190
because hopefully you've got a little

265
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,150
bit of CPU that you can actually think

266
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,180
about what you're saying while you're

267
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,730
saying it and say am I going too high up

268
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,180
am I going too high up in the stock am I

269
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,040
too abstracted am I not am I am I am I

270
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,410
hand waving a bit more am i gone up to a

271
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,410
survey level am I too basic for the

272
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,480
people who are in here or alternately

273
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,219
have I gone way far down because I find

274
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,350
the technical details awesome and

275
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,200
engrossing but they're really not

276
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:46,550
relevant to the subject at hand either

277
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,600
case the solution is finish your thought

278
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,660
because stopping the middle of a

279
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,890
sentence gets everybody weird finish

280
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,579
your thought and then say now that's

281
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,770
interesting

282
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,420
or you know that was I'm sure that there

283
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,189
was useful details for some people but

284
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,319
let's bring it back you could even just

285
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,120
say let's bring it back because then

286
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,560
people will know that you're actively

287
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,020
interested in bringing it back to

288
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,680
something that is useful to them

289
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:15,060
so in short boundaries are important

290
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,560
because that's how your talk stays

291
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,880
relevant to the people in the room at a

292
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,760
time they know they've shown up for the

293
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:29,760
things they want to show up for now if

294
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,660
instead we want to talk about um the

295
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,010
next thing after talking about

296
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,010
boundaries we want to talk about framing

297
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:43,520
okay

298
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:47,220
what does framing mean in this case so

299
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,840
put one way I could say it's the context

300
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,150
of your talk it's the context you are

301
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,690
giving for your talk the reason you're

302
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:56,400
there at all um another way to put it if

303
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,010
you like a sports metaphor is it's the

304
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,569
field you're playing on you decide I'm

305
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,770
going to play football on this football

306
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,940
field I'm gonna play cricket on this

307
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,920
cricket field or I'm going to play

308
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,720
something else on something else field

309
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,849
but this is the field I'm playing on and

310
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,400
fields have properties and you have

311
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,570
doesn't you have to decide that this is

312
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,910
the context in which I'm going to be

313
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:18,530
doing this thing whatever I'm doing now

314
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:20,189
what does this mean in this case well

315
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:25,449
think of it this way

316
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:27,550
part of it is describing um

317
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,840
so part of it is what is the problem

318
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,939
what is the solution why are you there

319
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,410
talking to people and so one of the

320
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,490
things you can do because once again you

321
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,199
need to build the boundaries in

322
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,160
real-time everyone else walking you down

323
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,320
that room they might know what the

324
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:46,870
subject is but they don't know anything

325
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:54,460
else and so you can do stuff like assert

326
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:56,700
the problem and offer a solution now I

327
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:02,020
realize that sounds pretty salesy but uh

328
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:05,350
bear with me for a second here so

329
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:09,430
asserting the problem you know a way to

330
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,680
think this is I know that you all have a

331
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,599
problem and in fact I know what that

332
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,920
problem is and I'm going to tell you

333
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,230
what that problem is even though we all

334
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,670
know what the problem is just so we that

335
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,710
we can all acknowledge that we're on the

336
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:27,219
same page and so you start talking about

337
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:29,710
ok as far as I know the primary issue

338
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,360
here is you have web performance on the

339
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,280
site you've eliminated all the other

340
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,540
factors and you're reasonably sure that

341
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,500
it has to do with the way that your

342
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,880
origin is behaving ok so let's talk

343
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,680
about web performance there because

344
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,360
without saying that upset and just

345
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,209
saying ok so let's talk about your

346
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,970
urgent people like what why I didn't

347
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,560
know we had a problem with that that was

348
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,090
an issue and people start talking with

349
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,199
William Shatner it's very weird but the

350
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:59,410
point is that instead you are saying I

351
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,490
know why I am here and that sounds silly

352
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,530
but it's true

353
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,030
right and this could be for oK you've

354
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,189
got a meeting of five people inside your

355
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,949
company and you're doing a presentation

356
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,540
and it's the here's the reason we're

357
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,370
here here's the reason we're talking

358
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,980
here's the reason I'm in front of you

359
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,290
drawing on this whiteboard um

360
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:20,350
and that gets everybody on the same page

361
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:24,069
and the other thing that does is it

362
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:26,440
focuses the debate it says not only do I

363
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,090
know what the problem is but I know what

364
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,100
we're going to talk about and the level

365
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,270
of abstraction and the scope of what

366
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:38,230
we're going to talk about remember from

367
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:40,660
before scope and abstraction also all

368
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,710
the solution you know you know people

369
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,180
say I don't want problems I want

370
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,310
solutions and sometimes solutions are

371
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,650
hard but being able to say here is a

372
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,119
problem and even if we don't have a

373
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,230
solution we are going to discuss about

374
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,120
it because that's something that needs

375
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,590
solved well then your solution is that

376
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,690
you're discussing something that need

377
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:57,670
discussing it in order to get to one but

378
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,800
if there is a specific solution then

379
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:03,490
you're able to actually talk about it

380
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,959
and couch a problem in the terms of the

381
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,849
solution because this is your

382
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,470
presentation where you're trying to

383
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:10,839
convince somebody saying I believe this

384
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,839
is the problem I believe I found a

385
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:17,440
solution here's how I get there and the

386
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:20,800
interesting part there is that it also

387
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:25,839
gives you a safety because what happens

388
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,620
when you have the wrong problem somebody

389
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,780
in the room can correct you and

390
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:34,629
therefore without getting into the weeds

391
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,520
of the problem you can say okay let's

392
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,170
discuss the scope of the problem and now

393
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,900
once again everybody's on the same page

394
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:43,140
as opposed to one person tuning out and

395
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,640
wasting everybody's time in the process

396
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,420
the other thing by offering the solution

397
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,310
is that you get to guide the debate

398
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,500
first here's what we're going to focus

399
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,770
is what we're going to talk about guide

400
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,710
is how we're going to talk about it and

401
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:02,980
in the end people are there to listen to

402
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,780
you you are expected to be the expert in

403
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,340
the room and people generally want to

404
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,720
hear from you else they wouldn't be

405
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,679
putting it also you wouldn't be up there

406
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,260
in the front anyway

407
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,230
and that goes for any kind of talk like

408
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,270
this um the other thing that's

409
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:19,860
interesting I say interesting a lot I'm

410
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:24,760
really sorry about that but it's true is

411
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:27,610
talking about is talking about diagrams

412
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,620
so pictures right the nifty thing about

413
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,360
being able to deal with a whiteboard is

414
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,199
that you can think in terms of pictures

415
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:41,949
so here's here's a fun trick so I'm

416
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,270
gonna draw you know draw a you know I'm

417
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,280
sure people have seen the Gartner Magic

418
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,500
Quadrant there's four boxes or anybody

419
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,480
who's like gum anywhere within like 20

420
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,860
feet of a business or within like you

421
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,630
know 20 miles of business school scene

422
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,919
like Oh

423
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,200
okay there's four boxes and everything

424
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,970
fit something aside those four boxes

425
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,450
well there's something that's really

426
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,680
interesting about four boxes because as

427
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,690
soon as you put that up on the screen

428
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,840
and other people have seen that too you

429
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,490
are getting them to buy into a whole

430
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,110
bunch of different assumptions about the

431
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,200
world okay

432
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,669
let's count them off so now obviously

433
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,680
you know we're starting at the bottom

434
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:20,630
bottom left here so we got that we've

435
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:25,200
got that right and so first thing is

436
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:36,570
there are two axes and more importantly

437
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:38,280
those axes are relevant and distinct not

438
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,570
only do we care about them but we know

439
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,560
they're sufficiently different from each

440
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:46,590
other that we can put them on two

441
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:54,000
separate axes great - there are two

442
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:56,550
settings on each axis that are relevant

443
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,930
indistinct right you've got low and

444
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:02,940
you've got high you've got low and

445
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:06,900
you've got high low high low high I mean

446
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,670
this could be minus plus and minus plus

447
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,230
if you want it could be you know

448
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,970
whatever you want but in the end there's

449
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:20,490
only two settings on each axis and there

450
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:29,330
you go um three um there are only four

451
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:31,410
permutations that matter tations

452
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:35,178
only for puberty

453
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:38,520
that are actually relevant and distinct

454
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:41,400
maybe this is a good one and maybe

455
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,530
that's a bad one and maybe that's a good

456
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,370
one and maybe that's an awesome one I

457
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:49,320
don't know but in the end you have four

458
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,989
different things these are the only four

459
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,610
things worth talking about and they are

460
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,860
all sufficiently distinct from each

461
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:58,439
other and they are all of equal

462
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:09,750
relevance that they're worth talking

463
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:15,030
about right equal relevance so just by

464
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:16,920
drawing these four boxes I have you have

465
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:21,240
successfully dragged the audience along

466
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,580
on a whole bunch of other assumptions

467
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,850
about the way that you should see the

468
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,669
world you have both focus to discussion

469
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:34,709
such that this is the only world that

470
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:37,860
exists and you have guided the

471
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:41,390
discussion by saying that only those

472
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:44,250
four things are worth talking about

473
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:47,730
once again framing allows you to focus

474
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,530
and guide so let's take a couple of

475
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:58,320
other examples these then we'll move on

476
00:21:49,530 --> 00:22:00,450
alright so YouTube so if you think about

477
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,620
it another let's take a let's run

478
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:10,170
through a couple of more examples write

479
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:13,620
a number line okay zero to no 10 sounds

480
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:16,910
good and the 5 in the middle cuz I feel

481
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:20,600
like it well what happens at this point

482
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:26,280
now I've told you there's only one axis

483
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:33,309
right so one axis um things are linear

484
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:35,779
among linear distribution

485
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,459
I've told you what the rain I've told

486
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:39,169
you the range I've tell the extremes of

487
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:41,449
the ranch so how we're gonna think of

488
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:45,320
this between zero and ten and I've told

489
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:49,549
you there's a middle there is a point

490
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,019
exactly between these two and people

491
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:53,899
will people will say looking this way

492
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:57,559
okay so clearly there's a thing that

493
00:22:53,899 --> 00:23:00,439
could go from A to B and a and a half is

494
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:02,329
a viable setting as well and now we can

495
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,879
talk about that okay great let's take

496
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:09,979
another one this is the power of

497
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:17,899
pictures so um here's one everybody's

498
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:23,809
seen that's a bell curve just work with

499
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:26,359
me here right so it's a bell curve right

500
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:28,099
it's a normal distribution we know that

501
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:29,418
there are what do we know about normal

502
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:33,799
distributions there are standard

503
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:36,259
deviations there's we know that you know

504
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:41,569
sixty-six percent something like that is

505
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:45,079
within here and we know that you know 95

506
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:47,359
plus percent or whatever is in these and

507
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:50,299
then lots of stuff goes out here but

508
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,889
there is a middle most of the things

509
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:54,499
that we're looking at end up in the

510
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:57,829
middle and there's an even distribution

511
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:59,809
to both sides these are all traits of a

512
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:02,658
normal distribution if you draw a bell

513
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:06,319
curve on the board and this important

514
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:08,599
part whether you mean to or not you have

515
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,149
told people to assume everything about a

516
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,939
normal distribution which means choose

517
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:15,228
your pictures carefully because if you

518
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,449
draw a normal distribution on the words

519
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:18,859
draw bell curve on the board and then

520
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:20,209
suddenly what you're talking about has

521
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:22,999
nothing to do with their like then why

522
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:28,890
did you draw that picture and now you've

523
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:32,760
lost your audience so let's

524
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:41,640
another couple of examples so before we

525
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:44,940
before to finish up here another couple

526
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,390
of ways to think about framing is what

527
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,530
is um you know how do you how do you

528
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:57,570
give focus when you're actually talking

529
00:24:49,530 --> 00:25:04,260
right I can say enterprises are moving

530
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:05,879
to the cloud right what does that mean

531
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,980
well this now a discussion about cloud

532
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,210
migration you've even talked about the

533
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,030
businesses that are going to get moving

534
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,320
there and so people now chunk through

535
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,430
their heads and they go okay we're

536
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,570
talking about enterprises we're talking

537
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,090
about cloud migration we're talking

538
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:20,760
about migration between something and

539
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,709
going somewhere we're doing you've now

540
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,930
set up a cascade of assumptions about

541
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:32,400
what they're going to think about next

542
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:45,000
alternately there are four basic types

543
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:45,510
of of BOTS like you know scrapers or

544
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,780
BOTS

545
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:53,670
right so what have I said that point

546
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,200
well I've told you that you know this

547
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,170
behavior so what can happen that point

548
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,330
number one the behavior can be organized

549
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:03,150
we know that there are we can take the

550
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:07,230
noun BOTS and we can assign them

551
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:09,630
adjectives types and that those cluster

552
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:12,210
into four basic types of BOTS types one

553
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,830
two three and four and anything that we

554
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,890
talk about with bots or scrapers can be

555
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:18,659
classified into those categories people

556
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,790
have now set up four buckets on their

557
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,470
heads to talk about

558
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,629
BOTS and they're gonna busy start

559
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:27,360
sorting them and unless you get it

560
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,800
completely wrong that's how they're

561
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,229
gonna walk out of the room thinking

562
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,370
about it and that's the power of being

563
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:41,220
able to put thoughts in the people's

564
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:42,800
heads so now let's move on to let's move

565
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,510
on to

566
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:49,760
I'm gonna switch it up black is boring

567
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:53,100
let's try this one and said that's nice

568
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:57,660
depth okay it's even keen for like water

569
00:26:53,100 --> 00:27:01,909
depth like that um the what we're gonna

570
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:04,740
do for depth is just a note on it really

571
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:08,190
one phrase so I was in professional

572
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,710
services at Akamai and I thought a lot

573
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:12,960
of people about a lot of things and one

574
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,790
of the things that they had you do was

575
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,140
when you were when you were training up

576
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,280
to be a professional service person

577
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,830
before they would put you in front of a

578
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,530
customer is they do the white board

579
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:24,570
exams where you walked into a room with

580
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,310
a blank white board you were told what

581
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,200
you're going to talk about and you were

582
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,000
going to tol and you're going to tell

583
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,570
what your audience who your audience was

584
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,210
and you were just gonna do it and part

585
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:39,030
of this was to teach people a couple of

586
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,310
lessons in humility sure but mostly it

587
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,720
was about do you know how to talk you

588
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,210
know understanding yourself better

589
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,890
knowing how to knowing how to and how

590
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,740
not to talk about subjects and knowing

591
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:54,530
how you need to be prepared one phrase

592
00:27:49,740 --> 00:28:02,970
that I ended up talking using a lot was

593
00:27:54,530 --> 00:28:06,420
no 10 to teach 3 which is to say you

594
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:08,970
have to have it's obviously not

595
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,380
mathematical but you need a significant

596
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:13,350
you need significantly more depth of

597
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,080
knowledge then you then you then you

598
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:20,189
would need in order to have the reserves

599
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,540
to teach much less because while you

600
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,920
know what you're going to teach you

601
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,930
don't know what questions people are

602
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,380
going to ask and you don't know how far

603
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:31,020
you're going to have to reach into this

604
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,480
10 to pull out the three that you need

605
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,300
to pull out in order to show that a you

606
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,860
have the credibility and B that you can

607
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,389
coherently talk about the things that

608
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,639
they need to link together in their head

609
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,780
because every human is different and

610
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,590
they're not going to link things

611
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:49,379
together in the same way that you do um

612
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:54,020
in addition um and I cannot say this

613
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,020
enough it's really really important um

614
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:09,100
build a library rarey

615
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:11,350
of metaphors bill library of metaphors

616
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,590
think about how you want to talk about

617
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,659
your subject think about what metaphors

618
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,850
you're going to use you know the war

619
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,290
ways that you can describe a topic the

620
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,750
more audiences you're going to be able

621
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,340
to reach and you don't know how many

622
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,990
audiences you have you can have six

623
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,000
people and three different audiences in

624
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,530
room they're all listening for different

625
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,650
things that I'll learn different ways

626
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:36,420
that all need to figure out what's going

627
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:38,980
on and so yeah I mean you have you know

628
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,940
so you know I mean you think about in

629
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,550
terms of you know there's sports

630
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,870
metaphors which you know we should reach

631
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,600
bunch of people but turn a whole bunch

632
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:49,780
of people off there's you know media

633
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,070
metaphors which you know when you start

634
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,950
doing movie references and stuff but

635
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,419
then you're talking to a very very

636
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,730
specific culture a very very specific

637
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,770
age slice and that gets weird you can

638
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,300
talk about you know mechanical metaphors

639
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,950
which are a little bit easier in some

640
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,530
ways because everybody's interacted with

641
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:10,270
things that are simple mechanical in the

642
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:11,649
industrialized world obviously there are

643
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,180
other stuff like religious metaphors

644
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,660
don't do that you don't know who you're

645
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,600
talking to

646
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,590
um even if you do think you know who

647
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:22,179
you're talking to you don't know who

648
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,980
you're talking to you so there's you

649
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,380
know as far as you can I mean take your

650
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:30,790
pick but the more ways that you can

651
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,930
describe something um the more chances

652
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,350
you're going to have to be able to

653
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:37,450
describe to someone better and I would

654
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,060
say one of the things that I got the

655
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,130
most out of professional services in my

656
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,679
time there was collecting metaphors for

657
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,540
things how do I want to talk about a web

658
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,820
request I can talk about it as a

659
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:51,790
conversation I can talk about it as

660
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:54,850
somebody throwing a ball I can talk

661
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:56,200
about it as the requests they are you

662
00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:01,629
know I can talk about it in any number

663
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:08,500
of ways so but build the library and

664
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:09,250
then choose deliberately um so let me

665
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,020
give you a

666
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,610
cific example and not even just like the

667
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,750
know knows to stay away from because we

668
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:17,590
all know relations metaphors are a bad

669
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:19,570
idea so actually there's gonna actually

670
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:22,020
require a little bit of color so we're

671
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:27,070
gonna do a little bit of color right so

672
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:28,870
let's say that I'm decide to use colors

673
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,899
to talk about a thing let's say I'm

674
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,219
using well we'll call that red just just

675
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,790
work with me here

676
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:43,050
and black okay great

677
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:54,639
so we now have red and black if I'm in a

678
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:59,080
financial context actually if I'm in a

679
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:04,300
financial context haha I talked about

680
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:07,030
choosing your symbols right I've even

681
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:10,899
got a little table so in a financial

682
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:12,639
context um this is gonna be negative and

683
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,050
this is gonna mean positive I mean yeah

684
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,910
you can also have parenthesis but in

685
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:21,790
general things that are in the red or in

686
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:27,100
the black but let's say I'm talking in

687
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:30,480
an electrical context what happens at

688
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:36,550
that point well then red is positive

689
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:39,250
black negative so once again you so for

690
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:41,020
example using color is a fine fine thing

691
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,730
to do in fact typically what I'm

692
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:46,420
actually using an actual white board I

693
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:48,610
have typically black aunt black red and

694
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:52,660
two other colors typically black red

695
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:54,669
green blue with me just so I can just so

696
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,280
I can show people things a little note

697
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:59,560
about human perception humans are

698
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,030
particularly sensitive in the you know

699
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,980
with red and green and they're not

700
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,780
really all that sensitive to blue all

701
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,850
blues kind of begin to look alike a

702
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,730
little bit and they're also a little bit

703
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:12,699
harder to focus on so on a white board

704
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:16,390
it's crisp its crisp it's okay

705
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,980
but in general um using greens and reds

706
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,420
are going to are going to help you a bit

707
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,560
more feels of blue are a little bit hard

708
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,480
to focus on they're easier on the eyes

709
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,000
also keep in mind if you're talking

710
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,309
about color

711
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,460
colorblindness red-green color blindness

712
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:31,350
is a thing so make sure that you're

713
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,880
using things that you know are distinct

714
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:35,340
or call them out some other way

715
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,929
and that you say that you know okay I

716
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,939
could because then you can just put

717
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:41,309
words over and say you know red and

718
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,270
black right I can do that annotate that

719
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:43,649
and people will still know what I'm

720
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,970
talking about but that's an

721
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:50,580
accessibility thing and accessibility

722
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:52,500
matters so um one exercise I'm gonna

723
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,820
give you I never promised there wouldn't

724
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,559
be any homework but it's not like you're

725
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:00,480
reporting back to me is if we take since

726
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:10,739
we're all networkers here right if we

727
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:12,359
take the TCP three-way handshake so

728
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:14,100
here's the exercise I'd like I'd like

729
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,790
you all to do in your spare time because

730
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,989
I think you'd find it interesting um

731
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,899
okay we could talk about except a CAC

732
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:23,428
all day long but or you know since since

733
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:28,350
since the Naik Act but the important

734
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:30,418
thing here is to say how would I

735
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:33,319
describe it to someone who couldn't just

736
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:36,359
pack it into the flags and the packets

737
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,820
how would I describe it if I had two

738
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:42,029
minutes to describe it how would I

739
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,980
describe it if I had one minute to

740
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:48,929
describe it how would I describe it if I

741
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:55,469
had 30 seconds to describe it if I had

742
00:34:48,929 --> 00:35:02,730
one sentence or alternately over here I

743
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:06,839
had 15 minutes to describe that every

744
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:10,170
single one of those changes the way that

745
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:12,450
you take a look at what you're talking

746
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,580
about every one of them 15 minutes about

747
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:16,500
the three-way handshake you're gonna

748
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,390
talk about where it came from why it

749
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,600
exists in the first place

750
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:22,859
why you need it the problems it solves

751
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,150
maybe you end up going into the other

752
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,750
parts of the state machine while you're

753
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:29,520
there who knows two minutes you're just

754
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,460
talking about what it is one sentence

755
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,710
you're saying is how two hosts use TCP

756
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,230
to talk to initiate a TCP and talk of

757
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,910
each other right that there's all sorts

758
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,609
of things in there but if you want to

759
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,868
build a library of metaphors this is a

760
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:44,160
really quick way to do it

761
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:45,570
it's actually kind of nice that way and

762
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,100
it also gives you a bunch of depth on

763
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,630
how do I talk about the three-way

764
00:35:47,100 --> 00:36:00,118
handshake for 15 minutes without talking

765
00:35:48,630 --> 00:36:04,460
really so given that so let's see we got

766
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,460
15 minutes left huh okay here we go

767
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,900
okay

768
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:18,180
turbo round so a note so normally the

769
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,440
stock fits in in 19 minutes I don't get

770
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,410
that so we're gonna have a little bit of

771
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:27,330
fun here we go

772
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:29,190
agendas so agenda first we talk about X

773
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:32,190
then we talk about y then we talk about

774
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:35,850
unicorns then we talk about mangoes and

775
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:38,760
then there's QA about the mangos in the

776
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:42,150
unicorns so we have all that great got

777
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:47,670
an agenda so the first thing about an

778
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:49,440
agenda have one the easiest way to make

779
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,480
sure that you stay focused is to have an

780
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,330
agenda especially you know I know people

781
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,010
who will reject meeting invites if

782
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,600
there's no agenda in the meeting invite

783
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,940
because then they don't know why they're

784
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,650
there or why they're spending their time

785
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:04,230
likewise for a talk having an agenda

786
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,970
means that you are saying I have things

787
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:13,220
I want to talk about I am NOT going to

788
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:13,220
waste your time hopeful second thing

789
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:23,250
drive the agenda your goal now while

790
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,660
there are no bonus points for getting

791
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,740
through your entire agenda if there's

792
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,660
things that people want to talk about

793
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,368
anybody who's been an executive meeting

794
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,859
knows that if the executive decides to

795
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:38,130
focus a hyper focus on the one thing you

796
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:39,450
let them do that but in general you have

797
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,550
a set of things you want to get through

798
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:44,299
and there was probably a reason you

799
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,350
wanted to get through them so draw so

800
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,410
make sure that you're leaving enough

801
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:52,740
time have a watch put a watch somewhere

802
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,970
everybody's got a phone now um you know

803
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,259
be able to have that somewhere I'd be

804
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,419
able to display it and keep track of

805
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,000
your time and time management eventually

806
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,680
you know you do it enough it will it

807
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,430
will come as a little bit of second

808
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,870
nature but realizing no no no this

809
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,520
agenda is here because I wanted to get

810
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,480
through a bunch of that because I didn't

811
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,520
want more meetings on this because

812
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,840
meeting is take time it's important and

813
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,880
so the question so have an agenda is

814
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,330
obvious driving the agenda but how do

815
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,330
you do it

816
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,240
blame the agenda now what do I mean by

817
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:29,250
blamed the agenda I mean that your

818
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,890
agenda is the best excuse to tell people

819
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,900
to stop talking so you can keep going

820
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,069
you can say you people decide to go too

821
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,930
far in details in something and

822
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:39,720
someone's going forward wins too far

823
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,830
into the weeds say hey you know thank

824
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,569
you that was really important I

825
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:45,240
appreciate what you're saying we have a

826
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,770
lot to get through today I'm gonna ask

827
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,330
you to hold questions the end or take

828
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,610
them offline because there's a lot of

829
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:54,000
material to cover how many times have

830
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:55,680
you all heard that um just not well I

831
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,280
can feel it but you're nodding that's

832
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,960
fine V so in the end agendas are

833
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,190
incredibly important because you have to

834
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,780
because that is the way that you're able

835
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:14,010
to move your move your stuff forward

836
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:16,620
okay they're magical next you so a

837
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,300
couple of things about audiences so yeah

838
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,400
one other thing a note about parking

839
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,780
lots so I know that some people are like

840
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,900
hey you know that's great question we'll

841
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,240
talk about parking lots later well well

842
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:38,840
parking lot that for now so here's the

843
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:38,839
thing parking lots represent a debt debt

844
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,950
now they're my

845
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,598
a good reason to have a parking lot okay

846
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,740
here's things that I have to study or

847
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,630
he's things that I have to talk with

848
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,979
people about her here's to do items that

849
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:51,650
I can keep during my talk and I kind of

850
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,180
shove them off to the side but every

851
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:56,150
single one of those things that is a

852
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,290
follow up or that is something that

853
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,780
you're going to need to study later

854
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:02,900
what-have-you is hours of your time

855
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:06,170
either waiting or researching or what

856
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:11,589
have you and those cost time and money

857
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:14,390
so it's not wrong to have a parking lot

858
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:16,160
but keep in mind that everything that is

859
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,900
in this parking lot represents time

860
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,029
spent on that time that could be spent

861
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:25,220
on other things and it should be worth

862
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:31,520
it to do so let's talk a little bit

863
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:35,000
about audience interaction now in this

864
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,290
particular case the way that you know

865
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,319
I'm going to interact with you is

866
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:41,300
through QA and that's gonna come in

867
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:43,790
about 10 minutes or so and that's fine

868
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,299
I'll do that but let's say you're live

869
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:49,009
in an office or you are on a

870
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:50,540
videoconference or you know a cooler

871
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,680
where you can like kind of set up the

872
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,569
Brady Bunch for you and have everybody

873
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,490
looking each other and you can actually

874
00:40:53,569 --> 00:41:00,140
like get nods and smiles and see what's

875
00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:02,930
going on so in a lot of those cases so

876
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:09,950
in an audience the ideas that you can

877
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:11,919
choose three proxies you have you know

878
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:17,540
there's a bunch of people sitting here

879
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:19,490
and let's say and so choose three people

880
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:22,790
in the room and you're just gonna flick

881
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,740
back and forth between them and if this

882
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:27,619
person's have if this person's annoyed

883
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:31,399
that section is annoyed if that person

884
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:34,460
is happy that almost happy if that

885
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:38,829
person is I don't know

886
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:41,720
asleep or something then dreaming then

887
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,549
okay that they've lost attention and

888
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,328
just flick back and forth between them

889
00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:46,280
because you're not going to be able to

890
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:47,720
read every person in the room now if

891
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,579
you're on a video conference call

892
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:54,419
obviously the X is a little bit trickier

893
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:55,920
but fun fun fact people

894
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,270
typically if their cameras mounted on

895
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,140
top of their monitor they're not looking

896
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:02,250
at their camera maybe it's tilted right

897
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,839
maybe they're looking at you but it

898
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,400
might be looking they'll be looking a

899
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,808
little bit lower if I look at the camera

900
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,460
I look like I'm looking through your

901
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:09,690
soul and that gets a little unnerving

902
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,950
especially when I can do stuff like that

903
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:16,079
so um in the end check where people are

904
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:17,368
looking it's really not hard to tell

905
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,339
when people are on their phones I

906
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,720
promise they're typically looking down

907
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:24,240
their face dips a little bit out of

908
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,540
their everybody knows I can feel you

909
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,520
nodding again I promise

910
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,980
similarly are they looking away are they

911
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,180
reading something else are they do they

912
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,309
have you on mutant or talking about

913
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,279
other people necessarily or not right

914
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:40,710
you can see how engaged people are just

915
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,089
by flicking back and forth through

916
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,400
people to see what's going on in that

917
00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:49,619
case choosing three proxies is just as

918
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:52,680
easy as just as easy to do so also it

919
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:55,020
means that in situations for your more

920
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,990
real-time you can do things like use the

921
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,400
you know a videoconference offer have a

922
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,200
bunch of videoconference software has

923
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:06,240
raised your hand raise your virtual hand

924
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,730
and so you can do stuff like okay raise

925
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,040
your hand if you know if if you know

926
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,240
what X is and then you get half the

927
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,910
people in the room raising their hand

928
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,459
and you say okay half of you know about

929
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:19,200
X now that isn't a conversation right

930
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,990
that isn't a conversation at all you're

931
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,270
just pulling the audience so what what

932
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,379
is the purpose that number one you get a

933
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,230
little bit more knowledge about what

934
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,130
they know number one number two they get

935
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:32,099
to learn a little bit more about

936
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:33,540
themselves okay only hey only half the

937
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:35,510
people who know them knew about that or

938
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,670
I didn't know about that how weird and

939
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:41,280
number three it's a way to reach out to

940
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:46,730
them and actually talk with them because

941
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:51,299
nothing nothing is more deadly to focus

942
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:58,319
then a PowerPoint slide that's on a

943
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:59,599
screen but okay ten that's the screen on

944
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,880
a screen

945
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,640
with a disembodied voice coming out of

946
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,499
somewhere right okay I'm looking at

947
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,940
static text on a screen this voice is

948
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:12,499
going blah blah blah and I have nothing

949
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,630
to focus on I've already read the slide

950
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:16,339
I have to wait for them to get done what

951
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,449
can I do now there are some times where

952
00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:19,069
you don't get picture-in-picture right

953
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:20,930
you have to be a disembodied voice and

954
00:44:19,069 --> 00:44:21,529
let's say you're happen to use you know

955
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,940
slides

956
00:44:21,529 --> 00:44:27,890
well once again hold the you know if you

957
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,390
can pull the audience great if you can

958
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,150
if it's a small group where you can take

959
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,920
questions great if there's any way that

960
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:36,109
you can be more interactive so that you

961
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,219
can actually get people to be engaged

962
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:38,859
because they feel there and you're not

963
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:46,479
just talking in their general direction

964
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:50,719
fabulous so um oh six minutes here we go

965
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:55,629
so um very quickly we're going to go

966
00:44:50,719 --> 00:45:00,109
through pitfalls okay

967
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:01,339
first what do geeks tend to do and what

968
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:03,519
do what do technically oriented people

969
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:11,749
tend to do when when they're talking so

970
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:13,488
um knowledge unless topic at you in no

971
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:14,988
particular order and you're gonna say

972
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:17,059
that I'm really smart well one problem

973
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:17,989
everyone else has done that too and they

974
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:19,009
know that you're doing that because

975
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:21,499
you've ran out of ideas on how to

976
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:24,890
present it presenting is a skill respect

977
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:33,558
your people's time too um taking things

978
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:34,009
personally if a person asks you a

979
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:36,800
question

980
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,120
not because they are challenging you it

981
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,940
is because they actually asking a

982
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:42,350
question or it is good to assume that

983
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,760
the first thing they're doing is asking

984
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,259
you a question because they wanna know

985
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,560
the answer and not because they're

986
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:52,700
trying to find you out as a fraud um but

987
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,380
the biggest one um and we're gonna talk

988
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:57,370
about this because really it is the one

989
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:02,690
thing you take away from this I'm happy

990
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:04,279
making stuff up being so being it having

991
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,180
it be so important that you know what

992
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,990
you're talking about

993
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:10,520
that you start filling in knowledge with

994
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:13,430
intuition on the fly without actually

995
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,690
knowing so let me talk about the

996
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,960
mechanics of that because this is

997
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:20,180
actually really important okay

998
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,830
so you're standing up here you're on a

999
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:28,730
white board right and you've got three

1000
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:31,330
people here in the audience okay so

1001
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:33,860
you're doing your spiel doing your thing

1002
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:37,040
first person ask a question question

1003
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:39,260
number one now you are 100% sure of that

1004
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,190
answer you don't it you just worked out

1005
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,490
the other day you might have read it

1006
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,030
beforehand and so you answer them and

1007
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:46,729
you got it right

1008
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:48,710
go see 100% you were 100% confident good

1009
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,390
for you goldstar next person ask a

1010
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,160
question too

1011
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,319
well let's say you're 95 percent correct

1012
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,759
maybe you worked on that last week you

1013
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,340
really remember it you remember typing

1014
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,680
it in but memories are weird and but you

1015
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,790
know you're 95% sure well you're never

1016
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,680
going to be a hundred percent sure of

1017
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:05,150
everything and one to twenty is good

1018
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,430
odds so okay

1019
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:11,540
one 120 is good odds so okay you answer

1020
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:13,879
that - and he got it right okay but now

1021
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:17,390
the third person asks the question now

1022
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,340
you're only 75% sure well here's the

1023
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:21,140
problem

1024
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,330
you're the question answerer now and you

1025
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,529
want to keep answering questions you

1026
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:26,270
want to convince yourself that hey I

1027
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,860
have right answers I'm clearly expert

1028
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,310
they think if the expert I'm feeling

1029
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,160
pretty good

1030
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:34,250
of course I'm going to answer them and

1031
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:37,220
let's say that's wrong well here's the

1032
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:39,680
problem they're not going to know it's

1033
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:44,899
wrong until they talk to one of their

1034
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:46,910
colleagues and they say hey and they're

1035
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:55,160
like dude that's wrong

1036
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:57,710
like what and in the end now your

1037
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:02,629
credibility is shot their credibility is

1038
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:04,010
shot um and and it was all because you

1039
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:08,680
needed to feel like you were the expert

1040
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:11,480
and that's just bad do not make stuff up

1041
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:22,549
saying I don't know is always better in

1042
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:25,579
the long run no really we checked so to

1043
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:28,579
wrap this all up actually I'm going to

1044
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:31,819
tell you about one more thing because so

1045
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:32,680
okay one and a half minutes great here

1046
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:35,779
we go

1047
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:40,509
problem audiences okay and if we go if

1048
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:45,109
we get so we have so first we have a

1049
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:46,579
sniper the person who will kind of make

1050
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:48,288
side comments to other people in the

1051
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:50,630
room but doesn't actually talk with you

1052
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:52,700
and doesn't actually interact they want

1053
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,200
all the they want all the pride of

1054
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,180
knowledge without the responsibility of

1055
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,848
actually being able to interact how do

1056
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,960
you deal with them drag them in I'm

1057
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:04,119
sorry do you have something to say off

1058
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:08,079
the class great let's talk about that um

1059
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:11,510
next the bully

1060
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,950
they had a memetic immune response they

1061
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,720
cannot believe what you're saying that

1062
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:17,000
has to be horrible that can that can't

1063
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,538
possibly true you're utterly wrong in

1064
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,779
general the answer is wait for them to

1065
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:26,029
be done do not address them just wait

1066
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:27,170
them out because all their co-workers

1067
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:30,520
are looking over like they're a crazy

1068
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:32,210
person and or the very least someone who

1069
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,480
hasn't really thought through their

1070
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:36,740
opinions through more appropriately and

1071
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,819
they're wondering waiting for them to

1072
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:41,839
wait them out to there's no reason to

1073
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:48,589
engage but the biggest one this one

1074
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:51,500
going to leave us is the knock knock now

1075
00:49:48,589 --> 00:50:00,819
what is knock knock knock knock

1076
00:49:51,500 --> 00:50:00,819
stands for not a question more of a calm

1077
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,680
you have seen these people they get up

1078
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:12,410
to the mic they're like well you know

1079
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:14,870
when I blob and also I brought up and

1080
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:16,609
similarly bla bla bla what the audience

1081
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:20,420
agree or with the panelists agree that

1082
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:21,830
bla bla bla bla bla and they didn't

1083
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,820
actually want to ask a question they

1084
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,720
just wanted to show everybody how smart

1085
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,370
they are

1086
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,459
if someone says there's not a question

1087
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:30,020
you said well this is for QA um I'd be

1088
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,910
glad to talk with you afterwards and

1089
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:35,270
just shut them down cut their mic if you

1090
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:37,790
need to it's that important because they

1091
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:40,720
are wasting everybody else's time for

1092
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:44,200
their satisfaction and that's a problem

1093
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:48,160
don't don't entertain the knock-knock

1094
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:53,569
so there's a lot else to talk about um

1095
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:55,100
but in the end we are now at QA and I

1096
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:56,270
hope this was useful to you there's a

1097
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,880
lot to talk about right there's

1098
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:01,460
boundaries framing controlling

1099
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,530
conversation focusing the debates you

1100
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:06,200
know focusing the debate guiding the

1101
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:08,150
debate how to handle problem audiences

1102
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,799
how to use diagrams to have things that

1103
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:11,690
people already buy into we've covered a

1104
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,040
lot of stuff here I hope this really

1105
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:14,150
helps you with your whiteboard I hope

1106
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,880
this really helps you of any kind of

1107
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:19,370
presentation you do especially with how

1108
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:26,330
you do a whiteboard so thank you very

1109
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:29,810
much and press the questions I cannot

1110
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:32,600
hear you you're right

1111
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:34,880
I was muted okay all right now you can

1112
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,770
hear me so thank thanks Matt for that

1113
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,150
presentation we do have some questions

1114
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:41,480
in the queue

1115
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:44,540
the first question now that you've done

1116
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:47,990
this live how does this compare to using

1117
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:49,880
a real physical whiteboard any advice or

1118
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:51,080
comments on the technology that you're

1119
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,270
using sure

1120
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:57,380
so number one my handwriting is so much

1121
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:58,940
nicer live getting used I mean even

1122
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,430
using a high-resolution graphics tablet

1123
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:04,100
it's just it's a difference get much

1124
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:06,379
like writing on paper just a horizontal

1125
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,790
plane and writing on a whiteboard is a

1126
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,100
vertical plane are two separate skills

1127
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:11,810
writing on someplace where you do not

1128
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,450
get the feedback of the written word in

1129
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:16,160
front of you where you're writing in one

1130
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:19,220
place and seeing it someplace else

1131
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,970
is another skill and that's important

1132
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,890
that's important

1133
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:26,330
well I'd say here is get the graphics

1134
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:29,870
tablet at a couple of extra weeks before

1135
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:31,340
you do this thing but in reality I like

1136
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:33,560
being able to select you know you get

1137
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,880
used to it I'm able to select you know

1138
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,380
Mabel select to be able to erase I'm

1139
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,610
able to do things and this just

1140
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,640
scratching the surface of what most

1141
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:42,530
whiteboard stuff uses it's it's

1142
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,879
interesting to me I wanted to use more

1143
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:53,600
capabilities of it but I just didn't

1144
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:56,860
have the time okay next question can you

1145
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,759
talk about the tool that you right now

1146
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,380
Chris and I allowed to talk about the

1147
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,490
tool I'm using right now yes yes you're

1148
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,780
allowed to talk about the two of yours

1149
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:05,330
in okay sorry

1150
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,730
so just so everybody knows Nanog has you

1151
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:09,020
know things about then talking about

1152
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,910
vendors but in this case since it's

1153
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:14,330
independent of that and just it's the

1154
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:17,720
thing Chris that sounds about right yes

1155
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:19,580
okay so um the tool here I'm using is

1156
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,310
called my row and so you can logo up in

1157
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:24,080
the top left corner it really is I did a

1158
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:26,299
web search for whiteboarding software

1159
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,710
it's came up with top ten whiteboarding

1160
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,910
software's and I chose one that looked

1161
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,670
good and this one that appears to have

1162
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:33,109
worked pretty well I'm still getting

1163
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:37,280
used to it I've only been playing with

1164
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:39,950
it for a few days now but ice but it

1165
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,030
does what I needed to and it's certainly

1166
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,529
I know I'm only scratching the surface

1167
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,320
of the feature set by just using it as a

1168
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:47,090
plain thing to write a white board on so

1169
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:49,550
you know without endorsing it I'd say

1170
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:51,080
that you know you will you've seen that

1171
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:56,090
about how the basic functionality works

1172
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:58,240
in practice and I'll leave it there next

1173
00:53:56,090 --> 00:54:01,240
question what do you think about

1174
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:05,270
standalone graphics programs versus

1175
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:07,910
versus whiteboards integrated with video

1176
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:09,860
conference you know if you're running a

1177
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:12,350
some evening if you're running a regular

1178
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:16,010
program like a separate program versus

1179
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:18,650
something that's in the web what is your

1180
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:20,930
opinion on what's your you know you

1181
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:23,750
mentioned there best classroom programs

1182
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:26,000
which was just before do you have any

1183
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:29,930
opinions on hardware selection

1184
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,309
so I'll I'm going to get so I'm going to

1185
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:33,230
go back to the previous question say by

1186
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:34,400
the way just in terms of the actual

1187
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:38,359
hardware I'm using for graphics I'm

1188
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:42,619
using a Wacom we Kong into us into OSEM

1189
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:43,609
pro graphics tablet which as of the time

1190
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:44,960
of this recording is a few hundred

1191
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:50,000
dollars

1192
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:51,109
but the and I I really enjoy it it works

1193
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,849
I've got really really neat handwriting

1194
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:54,290
and unfortunately while it isn't

1195
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:55,579
reflected here it is it's something

1196
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,990
where I could really see doing a lot of

1197
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:59,630
work especially for artistic work too so

1198
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:01,430
I'm happy with that um in terms of using

1199
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:04,280
you know native video conference

1200
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:07,250
whiteboard chat I have found that you

1201
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:10,150
know using a ground you know trying to

1202
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:15,410
like write with a mouse is just hard

1203
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:17,150
also most of the eye I mean if I have to

1204
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,379
use you know the video conferences

1205
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:20,390
built-in stuff because that's what's

1206
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,400
easy to integrate then I'll use it I

1207
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,359
just find that I'm much more comfortable

1208
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,300
if dedicated whiteboard software

1209
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:27,920
personally myself because it's just it

1210
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,500
flows better and it's actually meant for

1211
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:35,450
drawing as opposed to sketching stuff

1212
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:38,480
out I actually missed a little bit that

1213
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:41,359
question you know what what what did you

1214
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,960
consider in making your selections oh um

1215
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:46,790
so easier so in the case of apps it was

1216
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,869
really just a let me look through them

1217
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:49,490
and see what someone else said about the

1218
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:51,200
pros and cons and I'll choose one well

1219
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:53,930
choose a couple and see how they go it

1220
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,430
was really I do like the fact that I

1221
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:56,480
have a big workspace if you take a look

1222
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,410
at the bottom right of my screen you'll

1223
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,240
see I actually have a very large

1224
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:00,379
workspace I can move around there's a

1225
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,250
whole bunch of stuff we didn't even go

1226
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:05,299
through yet there's oh that's right you

1227
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,980
can't see it because I stopped writing

1228
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:08,420
the screen but there's basically this is

1229
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:12,260
just one thing if a gigantic workspace

1230
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:13,460
um which is awfully nice also the

1231
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,470
ability to share the whiteboard with

1232
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:18,829
others because part of what I like is

1233
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:20,299
the idea of being able to collaborate

1234
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:22,220
with people so everybody's working on

1235
00:56:20,299 --> 00:56:23,540
the same whiteboard at the same time to

1236
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:26,598
do a thing and especially if we're all

1237
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:28,160
stuck at home then this is a way to get

1238
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:29,599
people to collaborate in a graphical

1239
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,890
medium as opposed to trying to say

1240
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,829
things with words that may not actually

1241
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:35,540
match up with what they want and trying

1242
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:37,490
to do things in a graphic trying to do

1243
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,259
things in like a physio style program on

1244
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:42,770
the fly

1245
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:44,840
get pretty bulky it can get can get kind

1246
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:46,360
of kind of unwieldy because it was never

1247
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:50,420
meant for that kind of life drawing

1248
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:52,580
exercise so you know and as for the

1249
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:54,290
tablet mostly it's the okay well what's

1250
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:56,840
a pro tablet that's not gonna break the

1251
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:58,430
bank and that's gonna last a while and

1252
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,790
that's where I came up I had a budget

1253
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:03,290
and I chose something you can there are

1254
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:05,000
websites they'll show you there's you

1255
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:08,090
know tab there you can get a decent

1256
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,940
tablet for just shy of a hundred dollars

1257
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:12,320
a 100 USD as well I just want something

1258
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:17,420
high scale because like I'm just gonna

1259
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:20,300
keep it for him for a while alright I

1260
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,410
think that concludes the questions all

1261
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,870
right thank you very much for

1262
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:28,190
presentation knife-making reminder to

1263
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:30,170
welcome reminder the the Expo is going

1264
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:34,340
on right now if you'd like to join that

1265
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:37,670
link is on the website and do not forget

1266
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:39,500
to fill in the surveys I believe believe

1267
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:42,500
we're getting just what you're getting

1268
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:44,270
emails with links to surveys so you get

1269
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,670
the boos emails use that otherwise you

1270
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:48,920
can do from the website thank you very

1271
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:50,930
much and we'll move along to our next

1272
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,260
session in just a few minutes all right

1273
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:59,989
take care

1274
