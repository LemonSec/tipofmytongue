2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,330
well I would like to introduce Sarah

3
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:16,610
Chen who is a software engineer at

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:21,490
Arista she will be presenting on dynamic

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,490
floating for flooding in super announced

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:29,730
and thank you Tom

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:34,320
I will present to you today dynamic

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,360
flooding in super nodes in this

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,840
presentation our first introduced the

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,330
super node architecture and I will show

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,190
you how super nodes can be built as

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:51,720
alternatives to quarters in the super

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,589
nodes run link-state ITP the can benefit

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,750
te SR and the beer

15
00:00:54,589 --> 00:01:01,290
however link-state ITP has a flooding

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:05,250
problem in advanced topologies in this

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:09,680
talk I will present our solution called

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,680
dynamic flooding to this problem

19
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:18,490
so what do we need to do what do we need

20
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,280
to build a core router anyway um first

21
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:25,030
we need fabric which provides the

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,700
Penguins then we need to CPU for control

23
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,610
and management and we also need the line

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:35,460
cards for interfaces and packet

25
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:39,160
forwarding so let's think about what if

26
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,410
fabric is just a Ethernet what if the

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,899
control and the management plane mean

28
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,660
was distributed and what if the

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:52,619
lionheart had small fixed form-factor

30
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:56,380
routers then it becomes our super nodes

31
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:59,860
so here to start with and the fabric

32
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:02,830
becomes dual spines a pair of spine

33
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,920
nodes and the line cast becomes small

34
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,889
routers the small rotors are connected

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,920
to the spine in our lives spine topology

36
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:14,980
you can actually choose any topology for

37
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,690
redundancy but to start with we assume

38
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,350
that they're connected can be connected

39
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:23,650
to the leaf spine topology so in this

40
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:26,410
then it becomes our super node so it can

41
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,950
be extended with it easily you can have

42
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:32,620
more leaves connecting the spine or you

43
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:38,940
can have small spines or even more

44
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:44,160
stages so what do we get out of from

45
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:47,650
super node so on the left side is the

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,570
Lexi architecture we see that everything

47
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:55,570
is connected to two huge multi chassis

48
00:02:52,570 --> 00:03:01,180
cause and this cause are very expensive

49
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:03,579
and they are vendor locked if you buy

50
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,410
chassis from one vendor then you have it

51
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,010
through by the line cards from the same

52
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:12,370
vendor and that the entire site is

53
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:18,160
limited by the maximum scale of the one

54
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:22,450
core outer and the software upgrade is a

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:25,000
nightmare so if you are lucky blue

56
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:30,280
string to cause the

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,670
the entire site is gone on the other

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,870
hand if we have supernote to replace a

59
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:40,899
corner then we can see that first it can

60
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,880
be expanded very easily you can have

61
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,770
more leaves or more spines or more

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,260
stages and then it's multi-vendor so you

63
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:54,310
can buy leaves and spines from different

64
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:58,090
vendors and the software upgrade is much

65
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:01,440
easier so you can upgrade one know that

66
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,440
time incremental aid

67
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:14,379
so in the large and we can view the

68
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,720
internet using super nodes so on the

69
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:20,380
right hand side the the pitter shows

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,199
that our six node internet so every node

71
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:28,690
is actually a super node consisting of

72
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:33,580
two spies and eight beams so a total of

73
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:38,530
16 nodes so if we go up to some

74
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:43,690
production number then the ITP skill may

75
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:47,349
be a problem so on top of the to-do list

76
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:50,889
for super node is the scalable routing

77
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:54,039
within the super node we want to use

78
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:57,520
links data IGP in the super within the

79
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:01,659
super node however link state flooding

80
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:05,590
has a problem in a dense topology I will

81
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:10,750
explain this later and we need some

82
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:13,359
improvement here and on this list

83
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,630
we also listed another two items the

84
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,550
controlling abstraction and

85
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,760
architectural scalability I will not

86
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:25,870
cover this in this talk in this we have

87
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:32,909
separate drafts for these two items if

88
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:34,920
you are interesting to check that this

89
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,910
tries to convince you that adding state

90
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,830
is a good idea so information regarding

91
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,160
the behavior and the characteristic

92
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:47,669
state of links in the network is easily

93
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,190
khomeini IGP and our next generation

94
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,700
multicast and the traffic engineer can

95
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,190
all benefit for link state ITP

96
00:05:52,700 --> 00:06:01,340
however the ITP has a sterling limit

97
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,340
which is caused by the flooding

98
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:12,570
so I'll GP flooding is optimistic and

99
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:15,000
complete so you for one if another

100
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:18,719
receives an update from one neighbor

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,530
then it will flood this update to all

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,530
its other neighbors

103
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:29,990
so in a dance topology the amount of

104
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,500
information flooded may overwhelm the

105
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,290
control plane at scale so maybe there's

106
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,260
one now it cannot catch up so it will

107
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,389
lose the hello packets and a job the

108
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,810
adjacent cyst

109
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:48,020
this will cause morning State updates

110
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:50,389
causing another wave of flooding tending

111
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:54,729
a big dense Network there may be

112
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:59,210
multiple nodes that cannot overwhelmed

113
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:03,740
at the end and this can cause a network

114
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:09,109
crash so our goal is to reduce the

115
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:13,100
flooding in a dance topology so the idea

116
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:18,110
is we select a sub graph of the physical

117
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:21,500
topology and then the link state updates

118
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:25,280
are only flooded on this sub graph we

119
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:28,700
call it flooding topology and we can

120
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:32,020
choose the sparse sub graph to reduce

121
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,020
the flooding in the network

122
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,990
so here's the an example so on the Left

123
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,900
we have flood with the link States

124
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,210
updates are flooded on every link but on

125
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,840
the right hand side we have a flooding

126
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:55,349
topology which is a subset of the

127
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:58,739
original physical topology so ideally

128
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:01,699
every node will only receive one copy of

129
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,699
the link state update

130
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:08,489
so we call our solution as dynamic

131
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:12,210
flooding the key of dynamic flooding is

132
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:15,690
to choose the flooding topology from the

133
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:19,530
physical topology so here lists the five

134
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,960
requirements for that first the flooding

135
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,780
topology has to cover all the nodes in

136
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,030
the network because every node has to

137
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,330
receive a copy of the links then update

138
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:34,319
and this flooding topology has to

139
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:38,189
compute it dynamically if a topology

140
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:43,050
changes the flooding topology has to

141
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:46,140
appear adaptive to the change the second

142
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:49,410
requirement is the convergence so as

143
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,650
mentioned before in a dense Network at a

144
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:55,980
skill we may see Network collapse due to

145
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:59,660
the extensive flooding so we definitely

146
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,660
want to do better than that

147
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,870
so the flooding topology has to be

148
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,870
sparse enough

149
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:11,839
the certain requirement is that the

150
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:15,739
solution should address a variety of

151
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:19,249
dense topologies it should not just

152
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:24,229
address that are completely leaves by in

153
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:28,399
topology that's not sufficient because

154
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:31,369
when the topology changes it becomes no

155
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,369
longer becomes a link leaf spine

156
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:37,659
topology so we have to deal with as a

157
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:41,089
different kinds of dance topologies and

158
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:45,619
the motive stage across technologies and

159
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:47,899
its variants should also be addressed so

160
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:50,809
a complete graph this might not be a

161
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:56,569
practical one but addressing that is a

162
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:58,459
good demonstration of the generality the

163
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:01,939
first requirement of the flooding

164
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:05,268
topology is that there's no single point

165
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:08,659
of failure this means that if any link

166
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:12,259
or any node fails the flooding topology

167
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:17,119
remains connected so the links that

168
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:22,639
updates can still reach every node this

169
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:26,439
will not cause the convergence the fifth

170
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:30,109
requirement is it should be operational

171
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:35,029
efficiency now depending on the density

172
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:37,609
of the topology so we have an algorithm

173
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:41,599
to compute the product party from any

174
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:45,199
dense graph I will not cover in this

175
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:50,259
topic and in the in this presentation I

176
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:52,419
mean but we have for an an ITF draft

177
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:55,789
explaining there is a burden

178
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:59,478
so in this orientation i will mainly

179
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:00,879
talk about at high level how to deploy

180
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:04,069
it

181
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:08,269
so to detroit an emic flooding we take

182
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:12,998
any centralized approach so first we

183
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:17,059
select an error error leader in the area

184
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:18,050
so we can use the TR election mechanism

185
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:21,529
to elect

186
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:23,810
the area leader so the responsibility of

187
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:26,839
this error leader is to compute it

188
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:30,790
flooding topology from the physical

189
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,790
topology for the entire area

190
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,969
so this flooding topology is then

191
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:40,510
encoded into LS piece and distributed as

192
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:44,839
part of the normal length stated codes

193
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:48,439
so every node in this area will receive

194
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:51,230
the flood in topology and when Sur is

195
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,079
happening the flooding topology it will

196
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:57,079
only flood telling states on the

197
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,660
flooding topology so by the way the

198
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:02,719
traffic leader the data traffic is still

199
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,670
flow on the physical topology so this

200
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,050
flooding topology is owning for the

201
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:12,589
living State updates so when there is a

202
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:15,920
topology change the error leader can

203
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:21,350
recompute the flooding topology and then

204
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:25,550
redistribute it meanwhile and the node

205
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:27,440
can detect such a scenario and the

206
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,170
request the temporary for letting from

207
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,930
its neighbors we also have a mechanism

208
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,930
for the temporary faladi

209
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:45,120
so we have extended the eyes eyes and

210
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:48,390
the OSPF protocol's to do the dynamic

211
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,590
flooding and in particular we added a

212
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:57,689
terror leader sub TLB basically

213
00:12:52,590 --> 00:13:00,450
indicates whether our system is willing

214
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:03,420
to be an error leader or not so this

215
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:06,540
will be used in error leader election

216
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:12,329
and then we introduced a dynamic

217
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:14,400
flooding sub tell me this indicates ways

218
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,900
are not supposed to enemy flooding or

219
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,270
not hmm

220
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:23,730
this might be useful in the disputed

221
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:27,870
mode and to specify which albertsons the

222
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:33,600
diner flooding supports and they will

223
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:36,390
have a early era node ID gops so the

224
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,940
error leader will assign the error node

225
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:45,240
IDs to every node in the network and

226
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:48,720
then this Arian node IDs will be used to

227
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,210
encode the flooding topology and then

228
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,020
send in the flooding past here me

229
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:57,120
and the in the previous slides I

230
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,670
mentioned errors are temporary flooding

231
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,640
mechanism and this is achieved by using

232
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:05,280
the floody request here B so basically a

233
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,590
node can send to the Freddy request to

234
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,650
its neighbor and its neighbor will start

235
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:13,290
flooding on this link temporarily even

236
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,860
if the link is not part of the flooding

237
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,860
topology

238
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:28,790
here next I gonna show you some results

239
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:32,330
from our simulation so here and it shows

240
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:36,620
a complete graph of 10 notes so 10 notes

241
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:40,640
are fully meshed a total of 45 day today

242
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:45,440
as for the findings the stonee the lines

243
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:48,110
are the flooding topology the solid are

244
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,120
including the black and purple ones so

245
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,550
these are the flooding topology you can

246
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,520
see that it's really sparse a graph of

247
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:58,760
the original graph and that the dashed

248
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,670
lines are the non flooding data links so

249
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,670
data flows down the and still flows on

250
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:08,319
all the 45 links but the link state

251
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:13,449
updates only flow on the solid lines

252
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,450
there's only 11 flooding links on it

253
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:27,920
here's the flooding topology for for

254
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:31,880
spine and 17 DS so those are connected

255
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,280
in our live spine topology you can see

256
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:41,060
that every leaf is connecting to all the

257
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:43,160
spines so this can be replaced the

258
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:49,780
co-author in a small data center or

259
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:49,780
media sized media size the core router

260
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:57,050
again the solid lines are the flooding

261
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:00,110
topology and you can see that from the

262
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,449
leaf side you can see that and already

263
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:05,800
know there are four links but we only

264
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:10,000
choose two of them two for flooding the

265
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,000
the the link States

266
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:17,239
the spine side we can also see a

267
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:20,829
significant reduce the number of links

268
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:20,829
to be to flood

269
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:31,309
okay this this one which shows a street

270
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:40,339
here the crossed apology with 16 spines

271
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:43,100
and 6 16 64 108 he pierced and this can

272
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:45,799
be our large Colorado replacement we

273
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,589
didn't put it off the non flooding

274
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:52,730
backlinks otherwise you can just see a

275
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:58,910
black mmm but this is the flood in

276
00:16:52,730 --> 00:17:01,910
topology for this okay this is a

277
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:06,949
flooding to party for four spines and

278
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:09,289
the 16 teams so each leave is connecting

279
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:13,000
to all the spines and the owning to

280
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:18,039
needing to links are chosen as the

281
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,039
present as in the project ecology

282
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:31,230
so here's some numerical results so we

283
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:33,870
put up links bank apology with four

284
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:37,559
spines and the sixty leaves and then we

285
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:41,370
come to the airspace and IOH during the

286
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:44,460
process and then we find that without

287
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:49,080
dynamic flooding the spine has to

288
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:53,000
process a hundred and ten thousand T LSP

289
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:57,120
and IH and the leaves had to process

290
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,610
15,000 well with dynamic flooding we can

291
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,729
see a second image significantly reduce

292
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,250
the number there's a 62% saving in

293
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:13,019
spines and seventy-seven percent savings

294
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:16,429
in lived a saving of flooding so in

295
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:19,139
summary dynamic flooding can genetically

296
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:21,870
reduce the number links used for

297
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,990
flooding in the Turkish tense physical

298
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,989
topology

299
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,770
so that the discreet disgrace the

300
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:34,270
flooding allows the control plane to

301
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:38,530
scale so computer much larger and a

302
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:43,330
dense topology and running IGP link

303
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:45,879
state ID rupees and the using this such

304
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:49,919
a large parties so we can build super

305
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:53,740
nodes to replace the Lexi quarters and

306
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:57,520
the benefits of super nodes are listed

307
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,980
here so it's the multi vendor mmm it's

308
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,040
mix-and-match chassis you can buy

309
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:07,150
whether what you need and so when you

310
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:10,420
need it it's expanded very easily it

311
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:14,050
grows as you need then you can find more

312
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:18,210
leaves you can expand the pipe adding

313
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,210
more spines or adding more tears

314
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:27,740
and the the software upgrade is much

315
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:30,350
easier instead of having a single

316
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:34,580
chassis upgrade you just incrementally

317
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:39,399
and upgraded routers one by one

318
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,399
that's cause less destructive

319
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:47,020
and in the Lexi's of architecture if

320
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:50,380
both the co-authors are lost at the end

321
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,870
entire side is lost so with the super

322
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:58,290
node architecture the chances of losing

323
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:58,290
the entire soup analogy is very minimal

324
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:12,830
okay that's it for my presentation thank

325
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:14,960
you and for our questions please make

326
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,570
sure to use the questions panel to ask

327
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,150
any questions for the speaker our first

328
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:26,090
question is is there a state considering

329
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:30,650
implementing rift not now we don't have

330
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:33,649
any plan for that shortly the question

331
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,600
is is a solution form within a data

332
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,390
center why would you need a GP within

333
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,719
our data center fabric well we can use

334
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:49,340
PHP Val factor instead people do rsvp-te

335
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:53,630
or rst within a data center fabric yes

336
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:57,340
it can we can use it in the data center

337
00:20:53,630 --> 00:21:00,290
so because our our our present and

338
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:03,260
countdown the topology so you can use in

339
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:08,690
any scenario so in the data center

340
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:13,160
scenario you can use it for the part so

341
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:15,380
2 2 or have error obstruction which is

342
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,540
not covering this talk so you can

343
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:25,190
abstract the whole pot they did send the

344
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:28,159
pot as an area so as a super node okay

345
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:30,470
could you expand a a bit about the

346
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,180
advantages of using LS routing protocols

347
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:37,940
to manage data center compared with

348
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:41,600
using a path vector routing aka HP so I

349
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:45,860
think I have a slide for the why you

350
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,379
slink state and so so currently we'll

351
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:52,780
use PGP but we have a lot of hacks to

352
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:58,430
the natural BJT to carry the link States

353
00:21:52,780 --> 00:22:01,910
met the various big states so if we use

354
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:06,140
the link state protocol which is already

355
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:09,920
carrying those information then we have

356
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:13,630
all those T and like next generation

357
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,630
beer all those benefits come

358
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:18,649
okay I just want to ask a quick reminder

359
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:20,450
that right after this there's going to

360
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:22,428
be a newcomers zoom session with

361
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,039
breakouts and again if you have any more

362
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:27,710
questions please submit them to the

363
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:30,408
question is queue I guess there's a

364
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:32,899
request to see more results of

365
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:35,690
simulations example converge convergence

366
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:39,559
performance reduction LF a convergence

367
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:41,509
less optimal best path calculation in a

368
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,460
bigger deck is that something that you

369
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:48,979
potentially have somewhere online or

370
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:51,919
publish so we have a lot of simulations

371
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:54,320
basically to tested algorithm and to

372
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,570
computer the flooding topology but I

373
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,950
don't want to mention that the flooding

374
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:04,908
topology is many to flood the link

375
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:07,369
states it's not used for the data

376
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:13,249
traffic so the data traffic still flows

377
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:15,559
on the physical topology we have we

378
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:18,739
don't we have simulations for the

379
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:21,678
algorithm but we haven't deployed it in

380
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:26,299
a large network to get simulation

381
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:29,469
results for the convergence yet but we

382
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:37,849
have simulated simulation results not

383
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:40,399
real okay okay some a oneness phenomena

384
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:42,049
reminder after this presentation we're

385
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:43,488
gonna take our one-hour break during

386
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:45,859
that one hour if you're interested

387
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:48,710
there's a newcomer zoom with breakout

388
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:52,260
different sessions and outside of that

389
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:59,989
thank you very much thank you

390
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:59,989
