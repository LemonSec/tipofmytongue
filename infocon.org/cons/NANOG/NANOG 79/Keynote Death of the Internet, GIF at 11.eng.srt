2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,659
you

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,659
[Music]

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,260
today have the privilege introduce our

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,600
speaker Scott Brandner the title of his

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,560
presentation is death of the internet

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,000
gif at 11

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,029
all right so I'm gonna talk about that

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,660
after the Internet this is a phrase that

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,879
came up from the early 80s and the news

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,150
net it usually showed up as death of the

12
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:40,870
net to give at 11:00 at towards the end

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,600
of a spirited discussion on something

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,099
when somebody said something stupid like

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,860
let's charge everybody for email an

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,610
order to get rid of spam as one knows

17
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,350
that doesn't work so well what a what

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,150
Internet are we talking about here I'm

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,210
not talking about local connectivity I'm

20
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,769
not talking about your family saying the

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,510
internet it's down when somebody tripped

22
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:03,720
over the power cord or the Wi-Fi router

23
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,740
I'm talking about the Internet as the

24
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,010
conceptual thing that provides

25
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,080
connectivity around the world and we're

26
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,210
talking about people saying that that

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,880
doesn't work or that's going to get

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:20,410
replaced or that's going to fail next

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:23,320
week and when I say death what do I mean

30
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:25,210
I mean predicted significant outage

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,029
somebody says that the network will

32
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,429
collapse and just go away or that it'll

33
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,630
be entirely useless the Internet itself

34
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:36,580
is useless or it doesn't work or and

35
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,619
you'll see that most of these cases are

36
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,970
this that they're going to replace it

37
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,320
they're going to replace this internet

38
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,850
thing we've got with something that

39
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,220
works the net has died many times matter

40
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,600
of fact it's started dead according to

41
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,730
the mindset of a number of folks

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,979
generally when they somebody who

43
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,080
declares that the net is dead there's

44
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,200
there's somebody there to transform it

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,240
but not necessarily to rescue it I'll

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,950
review a few of these predicted deaths

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,348
there are certainly many they're going

48
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,739
on all the time and if you were the net

49
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:15,849
would be net killers obviously none of

50
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:17,950
the deaths took to quote Elliott Norris

51
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:21,040
writing about fallen trees in the

52
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:24,030
Olympic National Forest then that has

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,319
had a lively death indeed

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,780
you'll see down lower right-hand corner

55
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,089
of these slides that I've said the

56
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,010
categories of who is making these

57
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,680
predictions or who worried that where

58
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:38,859
this is coming from at the upper

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,829
left-hand corner here as Bell heads the

60
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:45,780
telephone world next to that is the news

61
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:49,090
media where there let's say challenged

62
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:53,650
understanding of Technology and every

63
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,450
nimeth 9 layer OSI model with a

64
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,769
political heir and there's a lot of

65
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,379
politics going on here

66
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:04,870
and finally the business The Wall Street

67
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:08,470
going nuts over something so let's start

68
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,870
with the beginning Paul Baran came up

69
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,349
with a concept of packet switching he

70
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,239
called it a message box but he was it

71
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:19,629
was packet switching that donald davies

72
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,940
renamed it but donald davies and others

73
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:25,358
have all said that paul baran did this

74
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,669
cheap reliable fast all kinds of stuff

75
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:31,510
for voice and data not just for voice

76
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:35,169
not just for data he went and presented

77
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:39,548
his ideas to AT&T back in the early 90s

78
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:42,099
and the early in 60 sorry and he was

79
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:44,680
told quote son this is how a telephone

80
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:47,500
works and they let him carefully through

81
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,359
how telephones work Cindy as far as AT&T

82
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,120
was concerned there was no conceivable

83
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,099
way that packet networking could work so

84
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,949
the network's dead before it even

85
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:59,018
started what our perp insisted and yes

86
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:01,959
Donald Davies and Larry Roberts and many

87
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,790
others were heated doing this this was

88
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,940
another this was the first case of

89
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:10,388
telephone mentality saying that the

90
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,389
internet doesn't work or can't work the

91
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:16,449
telephone people came along with x.25 as

92
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:19,870
the data solution connecting all your

93
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:21,970
computers together it was a primary way

94
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,919
of doing data connectivity for quite a

95
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,409
while and start for parts of the world

96
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:31,389
very expensive because they charged per

97
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:34,690
per block per byte or per bird per unit

98
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:36,340
of transfer and that can getting very

99
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,090
expensive but that's one of the features

100
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,489
of the telephone

101
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,789
proposals as they all you have to pay

102
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,220
for a drink for them but this x.25

103
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,680
turned out to be a moderate in the okay

104
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,260
transport for the internet other than

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,520
the cost the actual front functions were

106
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:57,789
okay I used it under under ISDN at

107
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,409
Harvard for a while but that way we were

108
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:05,530
getting flat right there so we didn't

109
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:07,750
have to do the huge prices a major claim

110
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,539
of the Internet as is the tcp/ip

111
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:15,910
internet being useless and going to go

112
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:20,020
away was the OSI gossip IPV 7ms nut mix

113
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:23,800
up the government's got together through

114
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,109
the ITU and came up with this constant

115
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,440
as OSI concept actually not the idea why

116
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,169
so came up with the concept of the OSI

117
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,340
protocol standards open interconnect

118
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:38,229
standards vastly complicated complicated

119
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,388
enough that you couldn't actually

120
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:43,840
implement the whole thing instead you

121
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:46,150
would do a profile which was a subset on

122
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,460
the left-hand side here is a set of the

123
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,609
standards that go into the OSI protocol

124
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,900
suite but this was the future it was

125
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,180
that it was not just the future because

126
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,620
it was better because it wasn't but it

127
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,139
was the future because the government

128
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,750
said it was it was mandated you had to

129
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:07,750
you had to provide the OSI protocol

130
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,340
suite when selling products to the

131
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,990
government to the US government and many

132
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,539
other governments around the world so

133
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,340
this was a political case where the

134
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:18,000
government's had decided that because

135
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,888
this standard was created by a

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,889
recognized international standards body

137
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:27,820
then it must be the right thing even the

138
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:31,389
IETF was on board for this the ITF had

139
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:34,810
it had an OSI transition area at the

140
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:37,810
time and the IAB came up with IP v 7

141
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,789
which was just used using OSI that led

142
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:44,229
to the IV's Alastor as the IETF

143
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:46,300
standards created standards approval

144
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:49,180
body and the West I went away but

145
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,950
finally died in the mid-1990s when the

146
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,930
US government decided that

147
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,909
that they're the parts of the government

148
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,950
could buy products that actually worked

149
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:01,000
rather than products that they told were

150
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:05,020
told they had by then there was IIST en

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,630
another telephone a mythology ISDN was

152
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,299
the the future and it was all that you

153
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,520
needed it connected voice and it

154
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,420
connected terminals the data the

155
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,450
computers when I when MIT went to buy a

156
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:22,360
five II switch they pert in the sales

157
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:25,390
person said that they IV came along with

158
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,210
ISDN and ISDN could replace all those

159
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:31,300
Ethernet that MIT was putting in 64

160
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,890
kilobits to the desktop was plenty and

161
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,890
if you had a server well then you could

162
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:40,030
use ICM primary rate at one point five

163
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:42,909
megabits per second we had ISDN set up

164
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,830
here at Harvard I'm using the centraq

165
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,440
service out of the local telephone

166
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:51,340
company it worked okay

167
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,719
it was expensive and complicated and it

168
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,429
was very very difficult to get

169
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,740
technicians to understand how to

170
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,290
actually telephone company technicians

171
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,780
understand how to actually make it work

172
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,700
but again it was it was the future and

173
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:09,340
was that going to replace all of these

174
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:11,650
silly things like Ethernet we had a

175
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:15,310
self-inflicted wound in the IETF in the

176
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,849
early 1990s and 1990 Vancouver IETF

177
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,890
meeting in 1990 Frank Solinsky projected

178
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:25,270
that we're going to run out of the Class

179
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:28,630
B IP addresses address blocks in the

180
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:31,659
middle of 1994 the press picked this up

181
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:34,479
and so did Wall Street and it was

182
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,760
decided by Wall Street you that nobody

183
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,610
should invest in any Internet Protocol

184
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,260
based service because the internet was

185
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,320
running out of addresses and we'd just

186
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,990
go and were just fade away nobel

187
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,200
proposed using IP x instead because it

188
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,050
had 48 bit addresses instead of 32-bit

189
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,630
addresses they fail to mention that at

190
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,910
the sortie 8-bit addresses were semi

191
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,689
randomly assigned and it would do

192
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:04,689
wonders to the routing table to adopt it

193
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,720
as the protocol IBM offered

194
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,730
Senay but SNA while it appeared to have

195
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,010
larger addresses really didn't because

196
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:16,300
SNA addresses were absent encoded

197
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:20,140
characters quite quickly the ITF

198
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,530
recovered from this proposed Nats and

199
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,810
and cider addressing and everything was

200
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,060
fine but it took it took many months

201
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,770
maybe even a year for Wall Street to

202
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,189
come back and start investing in IP

203
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:36,329
based things again and of course there's

204
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:39,100
ATM ATM was gonna replace everything

205
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:42,460
particularly was going to replace the IP

206
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,490
itself and most of TCP because it had

207
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,740
routing it had flow control guaranteeing

208
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,350
quality of service and it was going to

209
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:54,280
do everything I was admonished by the

210
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,980
chair of the ATM forum when the IETF

211
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,660
came up with an IP next generation that

212
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,580
didn't assume that it was running over

213
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:05,260
and was running over and as part of ATM

214
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,710
I didn't think that we were going to get

215
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,520
ATM to the center of Africa or that even

216
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:14,920
the center of Newark all that quickly

217
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,240
but they were absolutely convinced the

218
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,430
telephone companies were absolutely

219
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,180
convinced and billions and billions of

220
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:24,550
dollars were spent on ATM service my

221
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,790
idea was you have an ATM pipe into your

222
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:30,609
residence or into your business and you

223
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,620
get voice video and data over that and

224
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,440
again this is the telephone company

225
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,940
providing you the entire service there's

226
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,130
no reason for you to put in your own

227
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,900
network and this internet thing would go

228
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,240
away because we're just interconnected

229
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,520
the globally interconnected ATM networks

230
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:52,480
and the phone company would provide it

231
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:54,699
for you of course 1995 July 1995 Time

232
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,360
magazine published a cover story which

233
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:01,420
said in essence that 80% of the internet

234
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,400
was porn well this was a breathtakingly

235
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:08,290
poor piece of research it showed that

236
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:11,199
somebody who was looking at the porn

237
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,150
news groups in Usenet and discovered

238
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,540
that the porn news groups and use net

239
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,890
contained porn such a concept but in

240
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,870
particular eighty person

241
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,079
material on the porn news groups in

242
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,300
Usenet was porn

243
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,609
to me that's what was the other 20%

244
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,069
somebody is short-circuiting me we're

245
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,459
not getting my money's worth but this

246
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:36,130
was a big deal the press went nuts over

247
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:38,199
it Congress went nuts politicians all

248
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,329
over the world went nuts because you

249
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,209
can't possibly use this internet thing

250
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:45,760
for anything where it might be involved

251
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:48,099
you can't bring it into schools you

252
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,160
can't bring it into homes even

253
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,320
businesses are Chansey not because

254
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,140
they're those kids in the businesses but

255
00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:00,010
because somebody might say something on

256
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:05,949
the net that was offensive to kids

257
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:07,390
someplace then another that so the

258
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,890
internet was not going to be useful

259
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,470
because it was all full of porn and

260
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,510
therefore it's going to go away but yet

261
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,149
Bob Metcalfe who should have known

262
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:19,149
better he did he didn't understood

263
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:21,579
congestion when he did Ethernet but he

264
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:24,279
he projected that the internet was going

265
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:28,180
to have Google Apps it's huge collapses

266
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:30,370
like worldwide traffic jams on a highway

267
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,579
system and it didn't make any sense at

268
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,350
all he and I had back-to-back columns in

269
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:37,120
network world and a number of other

270
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,100
publications where he was saying that

271
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,930
the world would end the internet would

272
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,490
collapse and I was saying that he was

273
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,670
looking at the world through doom

274
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:48,220
colored glasses he said he would eat his

275
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:52,540
column if he was proved wrong he ate his

276
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,890
column but the press believed what he

277
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,439
was saying because they didn't really

278
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,180
understand how this thing worked as

279
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,930
partially as a result of the Time

280
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,939
magazine cover story the US Congress

281
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:07,719
passed Communications Decency Act in

282
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:10,540
1996 which made it illegal for you to

283
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,910
send anything on the internet that a kid

284
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,760
anywhere in the world under 18 shouldn't

285
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,890
see so it made it safe for kids by

286
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,459
making it impossible for anybody but

287
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:23,380
kids to use it this ran into the First

288
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:25,599
Amendment in the u.s. I testified in

289
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,420
federal court on this and said that the

290
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,420
strength of the Internet was the chaos

291
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,910
of unfettered innovation and the judge

292
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,520
quote

293
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:38,380
that in his final judgment to say that

294
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,290
it was that the CDA was entirely

295
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:44,630
unconstitutional by saying that the

296
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:47,900
chaos of unfettered speech was critical

297
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:50,660
in the u.s. note one part of the

298
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,120
communications easyacc did survive which

299
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,160
is section 230 which some people have

300
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,440
said invented the internet

301
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,319
if you I assume that you know what that

302
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,000
is if not they'll find the euro local

303
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,740
search engine to figure it out of course

304
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,750
the CDA was passed in an election year

305
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,090
and an election year no one's going to

306
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,770
vote in favor of child porn so it was a

307
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,110
foregone conclusion was going to be

308
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:18,890
passed and it was only the courts that

309
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:24,680
rescued us I first heard about 3G in

310
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:27,680
Taiwan from a belt core a long time bail

311
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,380
court employee who said three G's

312
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,579
earlier phones would replace all

313
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:37,189
networks all Ethernet Sall Wi-Fi Wi-Fi

314
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,920
had only just come into being at that

315
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,240
point because this again the telephone

316
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,079
company is going to provide the data

317
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,000
servers to you to you to every device

318
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,040
and the phone company would provided

319
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,380
that for you the Ethernet jack in the

320
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,349
wall would go away because the every

321
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,380
device would have its own 3G wireless

322
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:00,020
connectivity same thing of course was

323
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,310
said about 4G it's going to connect

324
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,900
everything together there in the phone

325
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,729
company whereby the service and you

326
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,150
wouldn't have to be running your own

327
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,380
network at how at home or at business

328
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:13,550
needless to say they didn't quite

329
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,960
succeed in that fashion somebody who

330
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,290
showed another person who should have

331
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,790
known better as his route Larry Roberts

332
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,949
he was one of the people that actually

333
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,870
built the original ARPANET and he

334
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,810
understood and he understood how things

335
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,150
worked but he decided that the or he

336
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,250
concluded but the network so could

337
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,230
beginning it gets so congested that it

338
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,480
was completely going to fail and the

339
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,000
only way to succeed in this was to go to

340
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,160
flow base networking so that all the

341
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,590
core routers all the backbone routers

342
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,810
would be replaced with what router is

343
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,710
that for example his company Caspian

344
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,949
networks built

345
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:53,450
which would allocate capacity based on

346
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:55,130
on the original link speed strangely

347
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:59,029
enough that didn't happen this was a

348
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:01,310
business play it was a lot of money went

349
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:03,230
into it including some of mine through a

350
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,290
venture capital firm that I had invested

351
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:09,589
in and of course it went away hundreds

352
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,750
of millions of dollars went away but the

353
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:12,950
Larry had a great great slogan the

354
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,770
Internet's broken I should know I

355
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:19,130
designed it well maybe they should admit

356
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:23,569
he designed it wrong well he didn't then

357
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:25,040
in the early 2000s ITU decided that they

358
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,370
were going to fix the internet by

359
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,500
replacing it entirely replace it with

360
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,170
something that we did they call the next

361
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,820
generation Network they didn't actually

362
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,640
say I think that the internet would go

363
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,080
right away right away so they included

364
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,779
in this diagram in the lower right hand

365
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,700
corner as that's the internet and

366
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:46,459
everything would be gateway to and from

367
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,649
me the core network would be this next

368
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:51,680
generation network if you were going to

369
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:53,839
be doing voice you would always use the

370
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,550
next generation Network because you get

371
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,670
guarantees which you don't get with the

372
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:00,920
internet people would spend extra money

373
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:04,879
in order to get this connectivity that's

374
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:07,609
from guaranteed service I was at a panel

375
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,100
in Geneva at the ITU where they were

376
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:12,559
discussing what standards were needed

377
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,839
for the Vidia in order to implement the

378
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,899
next generation internet the next

379
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,339
generation network and I said I didn't

380
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,780
think there were any that weren't really

381
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,448
needed this internet thing seemed to

382
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,459
work pretty good and in particular the

383
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,949
business model of charging people more

384
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,830
for better connectivity I didn't think

385
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:33,350
the internet was reliably crappy enough

386
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:36,169
to support that business model they

387
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,129
disagreed and when I said that they

388
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,710
didn't I didn't think there was

389
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,600
additional standards needed the person

390
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,700
who came up after me from bearish

391
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,800
telecom said that they were missing that

392
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,290
we were missing the tcp settlement

393
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,360
program protocol they were chill added

394
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,889
them to set up to send bills for

395
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,889
individual TCP sessions

396
00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:00,849
then we've got this whole thing about in

397
00:17:56,259 --> 00:18:03,849
network neutrality a lot of us liberal

398
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:06,009
ends let's say we're convinced that the

399
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:08,529
telephone count of the carriers were

400
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:10,749
going to be come to the conclusion that

401
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:12,849
they owned the network and that they

402
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:15,879
could control it in control when who did

403
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:17,619
what on it and they tried a few

404
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:20,168
telephone companies did try and do that

405
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:24,189
they blocked VPNs or they blocked voice

406
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:25,989
over IP D the FCC under Michael Powell

407
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,989
originally but then under successive

408
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:31,089
leaders tried to come up with a way to

409
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:32,529
say the telephone companies that they

410
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:35,950
should just be moving bits they

411
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:37,629
shouldn't be actually controlling what

412
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,999
was on their networks they shouldn't

413
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:42,299
they should take the telephone network

414
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:45,849
post post carterfone

415
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:47,769
as an example and just provide

416
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:51,599
communications for anybody who wanted it

417
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:55,179
but the courts kept shooting them down

418
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:57,428
finally the FCC in 2015

419
00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:00,609
followed the direction of the courts and

420
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:03,820
said that the who said the only way that

421
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:06,639
the FCC could regulate ISPs was to come

422
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:09,189
reclassify item as title 2 under the

423
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:12,008
Communications Act as in common carriers

424
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,649
so the FCC did that it survived a court

425
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:17,369
challenge it didn't survive a change of

426
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:20,139
administration's when the new admit new

427
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:25,209
president came in with a new party and a

428
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:27,879
new FCC chair the undid that setting a

429
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,859
number of us thought that title 2 is an

430
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:32,139
awful solution but it was the only

431
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:35,619
solution the courts would permit the FCC

432
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:38,589
to do and the FCC said they wouldn't

433
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:40,238
lose thousands of individual regulations

434
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:43,779
on they just put in the ones that

435
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:47,019
necessary to ensure that carriers stayed

436
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:48,999
out of the way when the FCC

437
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,369
undid this they called it the internet

438
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:53,259
restoring Internet freedom of course the

439
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:57,580
only Internet freedom they restored was

440
00:19:53,259 --> 00:20:01,779
the freedom of carriers to control what

441
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:03,070
you do now a big thing is 5g

442
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:05,440
the same thing it's going to replace

443
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,659
everything you get rid of all your

444
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,710
Ethernet and Wi-Fi and everything

445
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,870
it all be 5g gazillion blindingly fast

446
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:16,900
instant instant violating the speed of

447
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:18,909
light speed all kinds of stuff and it's

448
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:24,100
again the telephone company is going to

449
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:26,680
provide this for you and something going

450
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,639
on right now is what has been called the

451
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,430
new IP

452
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,080
it's a effort by Huawei and the Chinese

453
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:36,160
government or the Chinese government

454
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:39,730
through Wow way to define a new

455
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,190
transport layer for the Internet if they

456
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:44,500
tried initially at the IETF and the IETF

457
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:47,380
basically said now we don't really think

458
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,980
that's needed so now it's being worked

459
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:55,260
on at the ITU the a key feature of this

460
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:58,320
is this new new IP is it it's slow based

461
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:01,810
but that flows are not permitted to be

462
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,570
carried until the flow is tied to an

463
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,429
individual human being so a hundred

464
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,830
percent identification of all

465
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,780
communications this going on right now

466
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,780
the ITU will probably spend another

467
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:16,930
decade working on this like they did ng

468
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,980
in and will get much much of the same

469
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:21,880
result out of it

470
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:24,670
nothing and then more at more recent the

471
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,040
news the news media's all gone bonkers

472
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,890
over a covert nineteen and the effect on

473
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,110
the Internet

474
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,260
the stories are that Netflix is reducing

475
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:37,030
the quality of their image in Europe etc

476
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:40,330
but the reports I've seen is that the

477
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:43,360
peak usage of the net in the US with all

478
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,960
this stay in home efforts hasn't really

479
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,389
changed

480
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,850
it's just spread instead of being at

481
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:52,060
after dinner it's owned all day long now

482
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,550
so that the network's haven't had to be

483
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,110
strengthened and been built up because

484
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,200
they already were able to support that

485
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,419
peak load but the the news media quite

486
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,470
doesn't quite get that and is all a

487
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:07,510
titter about it so what's the root cause

488
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,300
for all of these there's only a few of

489
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:13,030
the many out there what's the root cause

490
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:16,030
well first of all the telephone company

491
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,639
and the people that came out of bellcore

492
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,649
and the like don't believe that packet

493
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,290
based networking actually were

494
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,970
they need to have circuits in their mind

495
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,370
in order to get guarantee quality of

496
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,800
service and enough capacity is not

497
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:32,439
enough to provide what they believe they

498
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:35,820
needed so just like bumblebees can't fly

499
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,290
the internet can't work by definition

500
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,480
there's the politician and so on the

501
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:43,450
sensor and the the most recent the

502
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,120
certainly the the new IP will work out

503
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,640
of China man Huawei is a censorship ploy

504
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:52,239
they want to be able to control what

505
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,730
people do on the network money Roberts

506
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,250
and Caspian networks are trying to make

507
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,290
money and telephone companies trying to

508
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,510
make money too so it's a the telephone

509
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,250
issues are combination of they don't

510
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,590
believe that packet based networking

511
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,780
works and that they want to be in charge

512
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,540
and make money and be the place that

513
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,550
makes money they moved from an

514
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,250
environment where we're naming we're

515
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:17,620
King and they were making billions of

516
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:20,050
dollars trillions of dollars on boy

517
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,239
services and that's mostly gone away and

518
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,129
they want to get back into the back end

519
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,170
of the game in this politicians

520
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,190
pontificating that's what led it got us

521
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:32,260
to the CDA and that's what will probably

522
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:34,660
maybe a major factor in the new IP is

523
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,390
that the politicians will say we need to

524
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,750
do this in order to be able to censor

525
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,850
and control and monitor our citizens and

526
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,680
finally the press the press really

527
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,219
doesn't have the faintest clue in

528
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:51,280
general of how this network works and so

529
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:55,060
they like being an expert in politics or

530
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,220
or liposuction just by throwing a dart

531
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,260
in the morning they were they trying to

532
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,960
understand and trying to tell us up

533
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:05,530
about the net and they're failing

534
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:07,330
dramatically this so what do we got what

535
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,420
we have is the network that's the mother

536
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,790
of revolution that didn't fail it didn't

537
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,470
die we have had a number of cases where

538
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,500
people thought it was going to die I'm

539
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:19,270
just showing you a few but they there

540
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,060
you go and then Hunchback of Notre Dame

541
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:25,090
its subscriber the printing press in the

542
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,080
way that the net has actually acted it

543
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:29,899
is

544
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,090
it's the Parrot revolution it's the

545
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:34,760
revolution that revolutions are born in

546
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,500
from the network itself is not the

547
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,860
revolution it's what it's done to

548
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:42,860
business since was done to the society

549
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:45,500
it's what it's done around the world in

550
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,510
spite of great odds and many people

551
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:52,159
saying it wasn't going to make it it

552
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:54,490
still did and I think that's a good good

553
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,490
ending

554
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,830
very much Scott thank you for your

555
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:04,509
contribution it was nice of you to do

556
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,908
this for us we appreciate it very much

557
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:08,259
I'm now gonna go into the Q&A so I

558
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:10,509
should we have a few that are lined up

559
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:12,009
and if your question was who is this

560
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,110
person on your screen talking to you

561
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:16,779
it's the correct answer is Papa Smurf

562
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:18,850
that's what my music say so easy so

563
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:19,899
first question spread heard that we have

564
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,139
for you is what do you believe the

565
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:26,070
biggest mistake we made was and we being

566
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:29,408
the ietf fire ours I can yes government

567
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:31,120
network operators etc that had been made

568
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:39,039
during the establishment of the

569
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:42,129
Internet's biggest mistake I think

570
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,999
probably I don't think we've made a

571
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:47,230
large number of mistakes we've made some

572
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:50,710
detours and I'm talking about that in

573
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:53,499
the presentation but in the end the fact

574
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,379
that we weren't sure of ourselves and

575
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:58,090
the government wasn't sure of itself

576
00:25:55,379 --> 00:26:00,009
meant that we got what we deserved which

577
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,320
is a network that was generative and

578
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:06,159
working and doing all those wonderful

579
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,830
things I don't think that I think that

580
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,499
the obvious thing that governments would

581
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:14,499
have liked to do is to control it censor

582
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:15,909
it and the same thing for telephone

583
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:17,559
companies they would like to get money

584
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:20,049
out of it no no I don't think that we

585
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:26,200
fumble through without making big

586
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:29,679
mistakes okay thank you for that next

587
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:33,669
question we have is do you feel that the

588
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,619
the telecom act from 1996 killed

589
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:37,929
unbundled elements and therefore the CX

590
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:40,928
and competition in the last mile

591
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:44,649
peasants that truly killed choice for

592
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:46,090
end-users ability to choose well it's

593
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:48,070
not it's it's a certainly a different

594
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,949
area than what I talked about in here

595
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:53,908
but yes I don't know this telecom act

596
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:57,909
per se it's the interpretation of it by

597
00:26:53,909 --> 00:27:01,570
the by the FCC and particularly the

598
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:04,749
ability of the carriers to wheedle out

599
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:07,330
of the intent of the sharing

600
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:11,019
requirements get convinced in the FCC

601
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:12,908
that new fiber installations were exempt

602
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:18,129
and then putting all of their

603
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:19,960
telcos into into boxes near the near the

604
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:23,109
home near the residents and then running

605
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,830
fibre to them so you so you couldn't you

606
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:29,289
couldn't do the unbundling Canada took a

607
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,960
different approach I don't know what the

608
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:35,259
difference is in terms of availability

609
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,679
of competing services but it certainly

610
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:40,450
is a dearth of that around here if you

611
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,450
don't if you're not in an in an

612
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,820
environment that's big enough for big

613
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:50,080
enough for cable you're you're pretty

614
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:53,220
much soaked your DSL with a carrier that

615
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,809
doesn't particularly care about you okay

616
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,820
thank you for that the next question you

617
00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:00,418
have queued up is how do you see the

618
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,379
impossibilities or possibilities of

619
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:04,299
indefinitely growth of Internet traffic

620
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:08,168
and connected devices people on the

621
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:11,019
planet with obviously limited resources

622
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:14,259
and energy well I don't know how much

623
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:17,409
limited the resources are we've got

624
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:19,749
fiber growth still going on we've still

625
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:21,580
got the ability to use the fiber is

626
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:24,489
getting better and better so I don't

627
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:27,099
know that the physical resources are all

628
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:29,679
that limited if they don't reach where

629
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:31,899
you nice get them to which is a lot of

630
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,539
the country doesn't doesn't have fiber

631
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:37,928
to the residents uneven fibre to the

632
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:42,489
neighborhood but so I don't know that we

633
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:46,929
were that limited in resources we're

634
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:48,429
limited in the desire for the people

635
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:51,119
that bring us the Internet to bring us

636
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:54,879
the Internet and not figure out how to

637
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:59,470
convert and convert it into couch

638
00:28:54,879 --> 00:29:02,529
potatoes the VCRs remote-controlled VCRs

639
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:04,210
for couch potatoes so what I don't I

640
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:08,409
really don't think that we're limited in

641
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:10,450
physical resources that much you think

642
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:12,369
you next question is one of the most

643
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:16,649
important next steps of the internet

644
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:16,649
evolution if not new IP are there others

645
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:22,899
they're certainly not new IP well the

646
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,960
next evolutionary steps along the way

647
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:27,870
we've certainly

648
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,630
being amazed everybody who's been really

649
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:33,149
involved it had been amazed that

650
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:36,690
protocols and technologies that were

651
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:39,480
designed for 56 kilobits environments

652
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:42,180
which is the original ARPANET or

653
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,550
environments where a whole country was

654
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:49,680
64 kilobits are working in today's multi

655
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:51,090
terabit environments but there's no

656
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,900
particular reason to think they will

657
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:58,110
stop continuing to work the transition

658
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:01,020
to a different system is a real would be

659
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:05,340
a real bummer and it's if we go back and

660
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:07,740
look at transitioning to IP from NCP on

661
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:12,090
the on the ARPANET that was supposed to

662
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:16,110
happen on January 1st 1983 with a couple

663
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:18,419
hundred computers it took six months so

664
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,540
there was no flash day if we try to do

665
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,880
the same thing today it would take about

666
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,830
using the same ratio it would take about

667
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,230
four or five times projected lifetime of

668
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,540
the universe to do the conversion so

669
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:33,740
we're not going to convert away from IP

670
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:36,659
for a very very long time you might have

671
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,490
if a new IP comes along and gets

672
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,580
mandated by governments which is of

673
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:45,420
course their desire the ITU is desire

674
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:48,870
and will always desire then there were

675
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:51,680
certainly be difficulties there are a

676
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:54,629
relatively small number of vendors

677
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,930
there's small relatively small number of

678
00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:00,320
vendors for the software for for

679
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:04,280
smartphones for mobile devices for

680
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,560
Internet of Things devices and for

681
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:10,500
computing devices laptops and desktops

682
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,750
so when theory one could get rapid

683
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,650
deployment of a new protocol in practice

684
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:18,420
that's never happened okay I'll give you

685
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,620
one more quick one we need to wrap it up

686
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:24,150
this is kind of related to transition

687
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:29,790
what lessons should we learn from the

688
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:31,380
slow transition to ipv6 I think that you

689
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,780
you transition what you need to

690
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:38,730
transition we needed to transition and

691
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:41,519
in 1983 was ipv4 to get to

692
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:44,669
an Internet not a not a network of not a

693
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,919
single network but an Internet one of

694
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:49,830
the things we learned in doing ipv6 was

695
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:54,629
that in very many ways we didn't really

696
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:57,239
need it at the time we be running out of

697
00:31:54,629 --> 00:32:00,119
solinsky's worried about running out of

698
00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:04,289
IP addresses was was negated by cider

699
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:05,039
and by Nats and it's done wonders along

700
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:08,070
that line

701
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:11,340
but according to Google's mapping we're

702
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,230
at 30 percent or more the traffic is v6

703
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,709
and that's mostly because it's a lot of

704
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:18,899
smart phones around v6 I've run v6 at

705
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:22,710
home because Comcast provides it as a

706
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:24,869
default and so it's taken a long time I

707
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:27,330
think the big issue biggest issue was

708
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:30,059
that Microsoft didn't care about it and

709
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:33,029
didn't put it into Windows and therefore

710
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:36,119
there was no demand for it Apple put it

711
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:38,100
into their products but who cared I did

712
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:41,519
but most people didn't care about Apple

713
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:44,009
at the time 98% of the network didn't

714
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,799
seem to so Microsoft didn't put it there

715
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:50,129
then companies won't won't putting it in

716
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,539
won't need it then for the ISPs won't be

717
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:55,980
able to sell it so they didn't do

718
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:57,330
anything well I'm afraid we have a lot

719
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,909
of more questions queued up but we just

720
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,769
don't have time for them and give a very

721
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:05,399
popular talk very puffy presenter we

722
