[Music]

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,659
you

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,659
[Music]

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,500
I would like to introduce our next

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,540
speaker

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,270
Joe has from H come he will be

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,270
presenting on 5g QuickStart

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,529
okay guys that's a real gold you just

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,529
heard it from Ned head to bid Bell head

10
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:33,950
in 20 minutes I've been working on this

11
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:38,230
stuff since I first bought the guide to

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:40,699
the telephone network back in 1973 so

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,220
it's taken me a little more than 20

14
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:48,559
minutes but hopefully we'll get at least

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:51,440
can clear some of the confusion we want

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,510
to cover the most overhyped protocol in

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,339
history as a near as I can tell I know

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,110
you all have your favourite candidates

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,079
for that but I think this one takes the

20
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:02,390
cake and our goal here is to give you

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,580
enough knowledge to be believable

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,660
so you have the basics of answering any

23
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:11,030
question somebody says like about 5g and

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,770
you also know where to look for for the

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,680
hard answers and the hard questions

26
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:20,600
because some of the answers are buried

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,330
pretty deep even today the new internet

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:27,158
explosion we got into this of the two of

29
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:30,890
us are consultants we identified a trend

30
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,229
about 18 months ago that that the

31
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,210
internet was just going to explode 400

32
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,470
gigabit links are coming out I'm sure a

33
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,809
bunch of them already been rolled out

34
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,630
we'll hear about it and presentations

35
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,720
the five T rollout is just not going to

36
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,509
be stopped it can coexist with other

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,140
networks and you can make a lot of money

38
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:54,460
by quote replanting your old 3G networks

39
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,500
of 5g this thing is going gangbusters

40
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,479
also there's another major expansion and

41
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,630
unlicensed radio that nobody ever hears

42
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:05,450
about because 5 G's steals all the show

43
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,100
sig Fox is planning to sell dollar

44
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,920
trackers and they have a billion

45
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,690
customers and some of you are already

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,988
working on selling lower on know that

47
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,660
from talking to you and just in from the

48
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:22,310
last session there were a lot of talks

49
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:26,109
on vector routing so I mean this stuff

50
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,400
it's a confluence of a lot of trends the

51
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,680
internet is not gonna look the same next

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,510
year and you need to know a lot about 5g

53
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,860
maybe not a lot that you need to protect

54
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:39,859
yourself with some

55
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:42,140
knowledge one of the things that's real

56
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,600
important is to know what 5g isn't my

57
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,750
little illustration shows that looks a

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,549
lot like 4G doesn't it and yes it does

59
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:54,980
well you can say it's LTE with an extra

60
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:58,490
channel and this icon is 5ge it's not

61
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:02,209
really 5g I saw this icon the first time

62
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,910
about a year ago it is they exactly what

63
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:07,880
it says LTE with an extra channel trick

64
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:11,329
with 5g is you can have all the channels

65
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,000
you're willing to buy my mo multiple in

66
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,239
multiple output is touted as a great 5g

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,459
feature but it's been around a while too

68
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,860
now what is coming out is coordinated

69
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,170
multiple channels so I can split one

70
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,600
data stream across multiple radiantly

71
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:30,320
she can't do that today

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,900
C ran I first saw C ran 10 years ago so

73
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,410
it's a key component of 5g and if you

74
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,799
read any 5gb paper it says that 5g needs

75
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,829
is introducing see gran no it didn't it

76
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,690
was introduced in a test with Chinese

77
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,660
telecom and TT and a bunch of other

78
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,910
people about 10 years ago now here's the

79
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,640
one you always hear 5g is needed for

80
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,890
self-driving cars no self-driving cars

81
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,720
been running on LTE for at least 18

82
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,380
months maybe two or three years they

83
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,570
even got trucks running on LTE so no you

84
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,420
don't need it what you do need it for is

85
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,310
vehicle to vehicle communication so when

86
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,200
the guy turns left in front of you his

87
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,480
car can tell your car to put on the

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,640
brakes

89
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,570
5g isn't necessary for the expansion of

90
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,070
IOT you hear a lot about this but a lot

91
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,649
of these run on cheaper unlicensed

92
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,830
protocols it's just flat too expensive

93
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:28,010
to buy all of everything you need for

94
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:30,710
five T and then by 5g and then by

95
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,419
license and buy all of the equipment you

96
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,000
need when you can do that a whole lot

97
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:37,340
simpler with some other protocol but

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,030
there are still applications for

99
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,520
unlicensed 5g nets at 6.2 gigahertz so

100
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,789
there is such a thing as unlicensed 5g

101
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,590
so for and what in short

102
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,910
there are a bunch of little exceptions

103
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,380
in in the 5g world that are out there

104
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,480
that kind of make it sound good

105
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,340
sometimes but a lot of the features have

106
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,260
already been around that's the bottom

107
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,210
line of this slide so when somebody

108
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:08,480
tells you that you have to have it maybe

109
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:09,950
you don't the basics or 500 5g sites are

110
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,050
being set up every month I think that

111
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,700
number is already up to a thousand we

112
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,850
put these slides together about four or

113
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,880
five months ago and it is true that not

114
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,710
even providers know where they all are

115
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,070
they claim to and they have lists but I

116
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,140
don't think they do what we can do is

117
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,900
show you some ways to find the ones in

118
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,700
your area or if you're sent out to do a

119
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,799
marketing study it's an easy way to do

120
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,280
it I'm gonna go find out where the sites

121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:41,120
are because a lot of these are currently

122
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,609
fixed sites Houston was set up about 18

123
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,540
months ago in a Spring Branch I think

124
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:52,580
district with 5g fixed downtown San Jose

125
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:55,250
was wired up last summer with 5g fixed

126
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,409
from point to point so there's a lot of

127
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,270
it that's in fixed sites and that

128
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,840
competes with broadband it competes with

129
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:05,180
almost everything now no one also knows

130
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,140
how the communities are going to react

131
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:12,650
to 5g somebody just asked me does 5g

132
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:15,050
cause coronavirus no I don't think so

133
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,909
but you can hear every other rumor you

134
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,660
want to hear you know the cows don't

135
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,250
give milk

136
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,800
there's witches that sit on top of the

137
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:25,790
tower you name it that's out there and

138
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,040
some communities don't want it and there

139
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,230
are some things that are concerns one of

140
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,570
the early complaints with 5g phones in

141
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,370
Chicago was that they got noticeably hot

142
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,820
in other words people have to set the

143
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:42,020
phone down on a long phone call and also

144
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:44,540
there's not much equipment about when we

145
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,370
about six months ago we were trying to

146
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,130
find equipment only thing I could find

147
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,070
was a 5g hotspot I couldn't even find a

148
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,719
phone phone was advanced delivery you

149
00:06:52,070 --> 00:07:00,380
could order it but you couldn't get it

150
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:03,910
so so take check it out look for sites

151
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:07,100
you don't ask the guy at the desk at the

152
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,200
Verizon shop or whatever about it you'll

153
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,210
get some funny answers sometimes but

154
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,620
they're also answers that you that you

155
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,070
can use to understand what's really

156
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,290
going on in the world and fine-toothed

157
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,500
acronym city I know you think that the

158
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,510
nanog organization is accurate in

159
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,210
organization but it really is acronym

160
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,039
city one ge amps maybe had ten acronyms

161
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,979
you could learn them all pretty simple

162
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,200
to understand and you go up and up and

163
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,590
up 3G you really start to got rolling

164
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,420
least twenty five algorithms but 5g has

165
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,520
all the above because you kind of got to

166
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,820
know what the old ones are to relate

167
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,219
them to the new ones and it also has a

168
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:50,150
bunch more for cloud services and

169
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,550
virtualization I honestly believe the

170
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,919
bottom bullet is correct that there are

171
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,550
more 5g organizations and all of other

172
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:02,750
mobile groups but together and in any

173
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,830
acronym a beginning with 5g has a chance

174
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:09,140
of being a new organization that's very

175
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,810
possible but some organizations that

176
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,909
begin with 3G still deal with 5g we'll

177
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,180
talk about that later here's a couple

178
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,680
more you see this in every nano

179
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,960
presentation network function

180
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,540
virtualization that's probably been

181
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,530
around at least seven or eight years

182
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,170
it's not exclusively mobile but you do

183
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,929
need it if you build a virtualized radio

184
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,820
network like you've built with the 5g

185
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,159
network because you can't have fiscal

186
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,650
instances of a lot of these devices and

187
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:45,969
you don't want to what you're one of the

188
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:49,010
big economics of using these cloud type

189
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:52,610
radio networks is you get in buy one or

190
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,020
a lot of reliability and if you don't

191
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,560
have that network function

192
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,840
virtualization you can't get that chap's

193
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,839
you haven't heard yet its unified user

194
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,510
in control plane what happens is there's

195
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,940
something called polar codes that allow

196
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,589
some signals to be much more reliable

197
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,760
than others even though they're on the

198
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,630
same channel so I now can put a very

199
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,810
reliable

200
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,390
control signal on the same channel as a

201
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,550
not so reliable voice channel so to

202
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,069
speak they're not really channels but I

203
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,959
can mix them up you couldn't do that

204
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:32,480
before the SS dynamic spectrum sharing

205
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,070
it allows an operator to share spectrum

206
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,350
between 5g LTE

207
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:41,450
I mean 4G LTE and v 2 it's very common

208
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,970
this isn't the same as sharing of radar

209
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:47,930
spectrum with Wi-Fi and the sea and the

210
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,580
citizens band radio band DSS is commonly

211
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,140
used and you're going to hear about it

212
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,720
and people are going to say they've got

213
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,610
a 5g network will have a 5g condensed

214
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,730
score and they'll find that the Ericsson

215
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:02,660
5g convinced core is more than happy to

216
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:05,240
run 4G LTE you're also going to say the

217
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,760
radio is totally changed and it has new

218
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,840
radio it's a more flexible control

219
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,920
protocol it allows a wider bandwidth for

220
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,800
radio but it also allows a user to use

221
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,630
multiple channels in a st. Rupa channels

222
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,479
and that group of channels gets switched

223
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:27,050
so I no longer have to have individual

224
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:31,160
channel switching it's a big deal all of

225
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:34,370
the new radio bands have a R in them so

226
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:39,140
you can find them in the end but they

227
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:44,140
are different realize that an OFDM 4G

228
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:49,220
OFDM OFDM is 5 GB which is multiple

229
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:53,000
instances of those little chunks of

230
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:56,990
spectrum quick comparison this is a

231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,360
grossly oversimplified chart just hinted

232
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:04,670
at one thing down here between 40 and 5g

233
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:09,730
how 5g lasts multiple channels to be

234
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:13,400
switch and also how n R is used for 5g

235
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,120
you can compare them differently and

236
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,319
here's the big deal about this chart

237
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,110
different features from into each

238
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:27,400
generation of service may exist in other

239
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,400
generations for example 3G release

240
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:36,480
did include note B which is more or less

241
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,899
what LTE is but yet its 3G so you'll see

242
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,110
these things that are kind of mixed up

243
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:45,240
and another thing to realize is

244
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:48,509
everything the first two up there are

245
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,449
just straight old circuit switched 3t is

246
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:53,639
a mix kinda because there are some

247
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:58,349
versions and features in 3G than aren't

248
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,850
an LTE and 5tn are are all digital when

249
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,519
you get a radio signal it's a digital

250
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:07,199
signal and it gives you a lot more

251
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:09,360
flexibility now the other thing to note

252
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:12,059
and this was something that was a

253
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,579
misconception of mine is that the

254
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:18,059
frequencies really aren't independent of

255
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:20,939
technology everybody's gonna hype 5g

256
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:24,209
well we're gonna run it 5,000 gigahertz

257
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:28,050
and you can run one foot but you'll get

258
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:31,469
buying binding data demos no that's an

259
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,149
exaggeration but they hiked the high

260
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,490
frequencies and they never talked about

261
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:38,490
it

262
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:40,470
t-mobile just set up a huge 5g network

263
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,410
all across the country and they used to

264
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,300
600 megahertz band that they'd gotten

265
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:49,500
access to because the government gave it

266
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:52,620
to so it's not automatic you can run 5g

267
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,680
anywhere a lot of us kind of ride in the

268
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,930
old 3G bands as people replant their

269
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,079
networks and we're going to talk a

270
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,029
little bit more about this on later free

271
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,500
cuts more because yeah this is the next

272
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,779
slide right we are going to talk more

273
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,759
about it there's two major sets of

274
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,439
figures these four 5g one of them is

275
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,929
down below seven gigahertz the other

276
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:16,500
ones way up there twenty four gigahertz

277
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:18,809
but guess what ATP runs a 5g network and

278
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,579
lot so they gets at 15 gigahertz that's

279
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:22,860
a fixed Network if you want to see one

280
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:26,339
of their towers it's right in the

281
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,889
parking lot of the Embassy Suites so you

282
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,480
know they're it's out there and it's not

283
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:32,939
all conform if you look at

284
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,160
internationally bands are all over the

285
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:39,389
place except most of them are at 3.5

286
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,699
gigahertz now the bands are kind of

287
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:43,350
funny I've been around so long

288
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:46,618
and I remember s band and L bands

289
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,720
specified by the I Triple E but they're

290
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:53,489
a little bit different when you get into

291
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:57,119
the bands on cell phones and and in our

292
00:13:53,489 --> 00:14:01,049
bands are often called SS band our s

293
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:04,739
band 5g but the I Triple E specifies is

294
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,850
a 2.4 2 to 4 gigahertz so look it up

295
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:07,889
don't even try it

296
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,859
remember the ones that you work with all

297
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:12,629
the time but don't be embarrassed to go

298
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:14,609
back and look them up they're all in

299
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:17,939
with Expedia there's lists all over the

300
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:22,679
Internet do not hesitate to look them up

301
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:24,509
save you a lot of heartache in the and

302
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,519
there's several other in our bands in

303
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:27,869
both s pan and L band like I said

304
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,609
there's some that are called at but

305
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:30,720
there's some that aren't called at and

306
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:34,829
they're right there in the middle of the

307
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,910
I Triple E designations so if it sounds

308
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:41,459
confusing it is was it made to be that

309
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:46,829
way I hope not but that's the way it's

310
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:49,888
turned out right now is a great time to

311
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:53,579
get on board or 5g because the press is

312
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:55,739
covering it very very well everything is

313
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:58,738
being published and much of it is

314
00:14:55,739 --> 00:15:01,739
indexed so you can find it I mean even

315
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:03,559
by rain but I went online and told

316
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:06,059
everybody what their network looks like

317
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,100
and who they bought it from how it's

318
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,410
gonna run how they what they're gonna do

319
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,419
with it in the future and there's a

320
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,429
company that publishes this they are

321
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,689
expensive tell the geography if you

322
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:16,949
haven't heard about them they're good

323
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:19,439
guys they really know what they're doing

324
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:22,559
they present it nanog as well you'll see

325
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:26,248
them about every two years showing up

326
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,230
and they have a blog and the stuff that

327
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:30,749
we need to know is all in their blog

328
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,730
they'll tell you that such and such is

329
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:36,209
just stuff wasn't set up a network like

330
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,889
this and follow um right now you can

331
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:40,199
follow this stuff and learn about it a

332
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:44,999
bit at a time just get on a mailing list

333
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:47,939
or two and they'll explain them now my

334
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:50,279
personal experience has been that once

335
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:53,459
the rush is over and everything set up

336
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:55,320
this information gets very hard to come

337
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:59,160
by if somebody walks up in

338
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,230
said you know a year from now and said

339
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,870
what is Bahrain doing for cellular

340
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,760
telephony here whatever our what is it

341
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,470
you're doing for smartphones it's gonna

342
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,420
be hard to find out they're not gonna

343
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,200
want to tell anybody because they're so

344
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,969
terrified somebody and listen to it so

345
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,530
are the people that sold it to them

346
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,840
don't want anyone knowing that that's

347
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:20,850
their customer so now it's a chance to

348
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,890
get on board with it your spot your cell

349
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:28,170
phone if your mailing lists you learn a

350
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:29,699
lot new radio is a 5-2 component we

351
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,270
talked a little about the frequencies

352
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:37,100
it's the replacement for LTE and the

353
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,100
UMTS universal mobile telecommunications

354
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:51,750
on where it has a 5g convinced core and

355
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:55,200
it can run LTE on the out on using the

356
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:58,200
LTE core so I can put new radio on top

357
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,920
of an LTE core for transition and all

358
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,810
but two networks run this way today one

359
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,438
of them is t-mobile and the other one is

360
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:10,470
Korean Telecom and even it neither one

361
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,780
of them is that large like we said

362
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:17,130
earlier the the bands are shown with an

363
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:20,490
in and and then they have a different

364
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:23,220
structure so what we're saying is be

365
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,890
aware that they can use the LTE

366
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,070
convinced core and Ericsson sells out a

367
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:32,160
lot they don't have to use the 5g core

368
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,870
but a few people do and you know it's

369
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,340
going to be more later on because you

370
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,250
don't get some of the benefits if you're

371
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,110
on the LTE core alright why the

372
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:44,190
virtualization this is a lot of

373
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:46,649
different ones when I see random we is

374
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,470
takes a baseband unit and pulls it back

375
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:53,160
to a central location so now I've kind

376
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:55,860
of got a virtualized basement it makes

377
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,290
for a lot of things to be much less

378
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,530
expensive also gives you some more

379
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:04,830
impulse in by one reliability now a

380
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,660
virtual radio access network does not

381
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,530
have the cell towers tied to specific

382
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,999
areas

383
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,099
so if

384
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:13,829
like a freeway if there's a big traffic

385
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:17,399
jam on the freeway I can share that

386
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:19,379
traffic from that traffic jam across two

387
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:22,109
or three towers rather than having being

388
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:24,988
forced into the tower that's closest to

389
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:27,269
the cars that are stopped now here's one

390
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:29,279
that's tricky open radio access network

391
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:31,979
this is a free-for-all

392
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,619
now there's two definitions of it one is

393
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:37,979
that any antenna B can be used with any

394
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:39,448
cell or phone so I can take this antenna

395
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:43,379
and it can be a part of this other

396
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:46,649
network and nobody's the wiser nobody

397
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:49,859
cares it also can be used for open

398
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:51,928
source radio network software that

399
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:54,718
stuff's out there if you're really into

400
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:56,339
this and when a program it now is not a

401
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:59,849
bad time to start because you can get

402
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:01,469
onboard very early on with open source

403
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:06,239
software that's going to drive a lot of

404
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:08,339
this stuff there's a drawing of the last

405
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:10,919
slide basically you can see the old

406
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:14,428
system where there were dedicated front

407
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,949
hall of inhale we split up some of the

408
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:19,469
functionality and allowed to be

409
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:24,419
virtualized now all of a sudden multiple

410
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:27,029
towers fit the news that the common

411
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:32,789
centralized units so I no longer have to

412
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:34,829
have everything on this one big baseband

413
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:36,569
unit and it's out in the field and some

414
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:40,428
I'm gonna have to pay somebody a lot of

415
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:42,989
money to set up because I got to pay

416
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,699
power on that thing too and it may be

417
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:47,069
hard to get to and I'm gonna have to run

418
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:52,079
a special power line to it so there's a

419
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:55,739
lot of lot of advantages of Syria my mo

420
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:57,928
massive in massive al this is a little

421
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:59,759
bit interesting concept too because it

422
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:02,069
when it's in the same time it's a little

423
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,739
more complicated than you at first thing

424
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:07,168
you just think oh okay I've got four

425
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:10,469
antennas I'm gonna set up four different

426
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:12,779
communications not so much for antennas

427
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:15,179
I'm going to have signals that are being

428
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:17,969
received maybe by four antennas or an

429
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:22,019
antenna array that's directive that I

430
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:25,509
can have these virtual channels

431
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:28,239
spatial basis for virtual spatial

432
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:31,090
channels on my antenna and one of those

433
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:33,519
little tricks these guys play is a use

434
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,580
multi path to develop multiple channels

435
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,559
as shown here if - I don't I don't know

436
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,168
how many of you have run microwave are

437
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,759
on microwave links or anything but you

438
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:44,499
know the planes are terrible for

439
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,989
microwave because out there you get

440
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:50,080
multipath to beat the band

441
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:51,999
but it's multipath if it kills you

442
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,850
because they're just slightly out of

443
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:56,559
sequence well what happens here is you

444
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,988
use multiple paths that bounces off a

445
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,389
building so the two paths between the

446
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:03,759
two antennas are appreciably different

447
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:08,049
so you can actually see them as

448
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:10,690
different paths in your radio control

449
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:12,820
software and you can assign them even

450
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:16,929
maybe two different antennas so I know

451
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:18,309
that if I use this antenna well I'll say

452
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:20,759
different antennas different

453
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:24,249
configurations are different drive

454
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,899
vectors of the antenna array I can

455
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:28,149
bounce this thing off a mountain and

456
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:31,149
it's going to have an appreciably

457
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:33,820
different face than the one that I'm

458
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:37,719
sending direct so this is an interesting

459
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,999
concept and right now you got phones

460
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,519
with two antennas on it up and down but

461
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:44,739
you're gonna see some maybe a third eye

462
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:46,480
there's a little bit of confusion on my

463
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:49,809
part is how far that's gonna go I've

464
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,749
taken 100 - I'm apart it's been a little

465
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,489
time on it and it's you and it's not

466
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:57,549
clear totally to me yet and I'll tell

467
00:21:54,489 --> 00:22:02,049
you what I don't know later on we're

468
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:03,820
gonna put in a email for John and I and

469
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:06,100
you can send us any question you want I

470
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,019
found out you can even send us a dead

471
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,029
phone if you want to I found out that

472
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:12,369
while we're working on this the more

473
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:14,259
questions we get from people the better

474
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:17,738
we understand it and the more helpful we

475
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:20,169
are more on my motors a couple antennas

476
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:24,789
one at the left is the Qualcomm test

477
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:27,279
antenna planar array of 256 elements and

478
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:29,639
these things can be multiplexed over a

479
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,440
neighborhood so I can have two of them

480
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:34,990
bunches of them and they point at

481
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,770
different houses depending on who's got

482
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:41,260
traffic and you can also gang them

483
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,389
together so that I can focus the energy

484
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,720
on that traffic channel not only can I

485
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:50,410
are my resources virtualized but the

486
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,410
intendant's can be ganged up and down at

487
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:57,070
the bottom this is not obvious so I can

488
00:22:53,410 --> 00:23:03,940
define polarization as well as a being

489
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:04,928
formed by the multiple arrays so the so

490
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,790
I'm going to have horizontal and

491
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:12,730
vertical polarization and that's two

492
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:14,830
channels so I'll buy and also there 18

493
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,350
teams is to buy two antennas in San

494
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,960
Francisco and this is a little bit like

495
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,820
getting to press but and I got it in you

496
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,440
could have gotten some free service for

497
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,590
a month or two you might still ask him

498
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,170
about it the Disney Network I mentioned

499
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:32,220
earlier also uses two by two antennas

500
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:36,000
there are little small things look like

501
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,000
gosh cookie tin

502
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:42,350
Maps now this is something we spend a

503
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:44,330
lot of time on the best map of all of

504
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,600
the installations is it up there at the

505
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:53,590
link at okhla and if they're kept up

506
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:56,269
based on license data sale data and also

507
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,519
just going around and asking as near as

508
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:01,130
I can tell I have yet to find a map

509
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:04,970
that's a hundred percent complete or and

510
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:06,950
accurate and sometimes they don't really

511
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,440
say who's the guy running it might be a

512
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:13,159
tower that's leased out so it might

513
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,529
lease the lease are rather than the

514
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,440
lessee but they're out there if you want

515
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:21,260
to find a tower there's plenty of maps

516
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,269
the countries have them to Ireland

517
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,639
here's one of Ireland and Dublin they

518
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:27,830
were one of the very early 5g test sites

519
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:32,629
and bless their hearts they even went

520
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:33,279
out and set up a map let you know where

521
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,350
they all are

522
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,539
this is the dockyards Dublin dockyards

523
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,370
and you can zoom in on these and they'll

524
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:44,510
tell you where it is what frequency it's

525
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:45,199
on and ever there's other sources the

526
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,200
tower data

527
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,110
everybody has a license list the FCC

528
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,710
does if you're in the US and there's and

529
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:57,139
and there's a good here live fire also

530
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,990
has an article about licenses and where

531
00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:02,289
to find stuff they may again not have it

532
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:07,220
well exactly what you're looking for

533
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:08,929
on-site tools okay one of the things if

534
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,289
you're in this business I would

535
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:15,769
encourage you to get yourself an SDR

536
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:19,059
it's a great learning tool and you can

537
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:22,130
get one that goes up to six gigahertz

538
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:25,700
relatively inexpensively militantly your

539
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:28,159
wife sites above ten gigahertz it's

540
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,110
gonna you gotta get a mixer and it's not

541
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,179
an easy thing to put together it's gonna

542
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,649
cost you around eight hundred thousand

543
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:35,380
dollars by the time you're all done

544
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:38,750
might be something you want to do

545
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:41,269
particularly if you're really into it

546
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:45,020
you're a student or maybe you get your

547
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:46,730
school to pay for it it also is a good

548
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,580
microwave learning site after you get

549
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:52,450
your mixer working with your

550
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:55,330
receiver troubleshooting the tower site

551
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,880
might be a lot easier for you now the

552
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:01,629
best utility for all these things is the

553
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,300
qualcomm rocket utility you can maybe

554
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:07,180
get it from Qualcomm they don't like to

555
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,919
give it away but they will and it's been

556
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,360
around for a while and you have to have

557
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,950
a jailbroken Android phone and it'll see

558
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,949
what the phone is seeing in mobile

559
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:20,410
concrete conversations it won't tell you

560
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:24,250
necessarily what the antenna is doing or

561
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:25,840
what the some of the core software on

562
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,250
the back end of all this stuff is doing

563
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,060
but it will tell you what the phone

564
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:32,320
thinks it's seeing in terms of service

565
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:34,750
you know be there for error correction

566
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,409
right there rates all kinds of things

567
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:41,560
it's a good tool like try asking around

568
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:44,590
if you have somebody in Qualcomm - and

569
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:47,639
what about phones right now almost

570
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:51,399
everything's hotspot and fixed endpoints

571
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,040
and not on and not all of them work on

572
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,050
more on more than one or two five

573
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,570
gigabit frequencies but most of these

574
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:00,730
guys the phones anyway you can see

575
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,750
aren't today or at least a couple of

576
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,650
months ago want to put this slide

577
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:08,650
together we're very expensive they're

578
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,180
about a thousand dollars and some of

579
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:12,460
them would support up to five or six

580
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:16,030
frequency bands just because you did

581
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:18,460
there weren't that many 5g towers out

582
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,240
there and you didn't know where you're

583
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,120
gonna land

584
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,390
5g is not international I mentioned that

585
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,719
3.5 gigahertz frequencies are kinda

586
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:31,060
standard they're not really used in the

587
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,880
u.s. they're used there a lot of other

588
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,530
places but not everywhere have a chart

589
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,570
of these things that I use there's one

590
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:39,399
in Wikipedia that's out of date but

591
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,700
still a good place to start

592
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,800
and they're all over the board and all

593
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,920
of these countries and every country has

594
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,010
at least three or four or five key

595
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,170
frequency bands so your phone is going

596
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,280
to come up with more radio so more I

597
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,960
don't know what they're going to do

598
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,750
about the antennas because broadband

599
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,910
antennas don't have very high gain but

600
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,480
anyway you want to lose the phone here

601
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,640
it is here's a list of device

602
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,370
this guy maintains this or at least he

603
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,919
was you can also just do a search and

604
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,899
you'll find them if you do a search on

605
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,120
eBay you'll find about a hundred phones

606
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:18,440
that only one or two of them will do 5g

607
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,510
real 5g phone forensics this is an area

608
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,080
that I had never heard of and I put it

609
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,750
in here

610
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,980
just because we discovered it when we

611
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,240
were putting these slides together and

612
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:32,000
there's so much hacking into phones

613
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,640
these days that and there's what's a

614
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,710
toolset I know the tool sets for Windows

615
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,340
and Linux so those kinds of things but

616
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,870
there exists for phones too and

617
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,309
cellebrite has a really good paper I've

618
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,080
referenced it down there if you're

619
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:47,570
interested in phone forensics or seeing

620
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,159
what's on your phone you can get a

621
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,409
little bit of stuff from cellebrite at

622
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,130
least they can tell you what's happening

623
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,130
now

624
00:28:55,059 --> 00:29:01,340
IOT sensor information is a big deal and

625
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:04,780
it isn't clear yet

626
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:08,270
how people are going to troubleshoot IOT

627
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:10,510
other than having somebody dig into it

628
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:13,460
and say this is this thing or whatever

629
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:15,379
so but anyway you can if you're

630
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,950
interested in phone forensics looked up

631
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:22,370
cell right give you a good start on

632
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,530
things and then you can play around with

633
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,689
some of it yourself I personally think

634
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:29,270
my iPhone has been hacked

635
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:31,429
no sim installed that's a good if you

636
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,960
ever get that message there's a good

637
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:35,210
chance that there's somebody who's

638
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,820
gotten into the thing somehow if you

639
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:42,350
have problems with your Apple ID and

640
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:44,120
steer clear of my wife loved naughty

641
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:48,199
piggies well they were very naughty

642
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:51,590
piggies indeed troubleshooting fiber

643
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,010
connections this is a tool it's called a

644
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:57,500
time time domain reflectometer if you're

645
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:59,929
doing this and you're not trying to do

646
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,910
any troubleshooting of the fiber itself

647
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:04,549
and you're gonna have to do some of that

648
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:07,429
to get into the phone side or the Bell

649
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:09,350
inside of the business and now something

650
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:12,470
I've never heard of called an IO ALM or

651
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:14,418
Interactive optical TDR what it does is

652
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,260
read the fiber characteristics so you

653
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:20,460
don't have to set all the parameter

654
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,200
it's they aren't cheap regular TDR is

655
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,350
dirt cheap I think you get one for about

656
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,000
fifty dollars now so do that and if

657
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,949
you're having to do this on a regular

658
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,360
basis as part of your job and you don't

659
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:35,580
have an IO LM don't find somebody and

660
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,860
say hey this is what we need it does

661
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,270
make it according to what I've read

662
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,219
about these things that cuts the

663
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:46,290
troubleshooting time down by an order of

664
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:48,600
magnitude mobile phone-based utilities

665
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:51,110
now some people have gone out and

666
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,209
written some mobile phone-based

667
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:56,070
utilities some of them are nothing much

668
00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:00,390
they just go out and read what's in

669
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:04,350
settings non-support 5g iPhone net

670
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:07,320
analyzer RF analyzer is the one I show

671
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:09,449
there I think and it has what it does is

672
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,280
real simple it will show you well who

673
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,470
thinks you're connected to what kind of

674
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,840
power you got and then rather than

675
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:19,080
measure all the other towers it has a

676
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,699
database that it has created sort of

677
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:25,559
like the Atlas database for BGP of where

678
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,710
this reception is good and bad from

679
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:31,200
different vendors they collect the data

680
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,929
off with some of their utilities and

681
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:38,910
then they put it on a map and it's not

682
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:40,710
bad in the theirs and what's gonna

683
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:44,000
happen with five tiers any of this is

684
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:47,760
going to work well it says here probably

685
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,760
not just yeah what happens is the

686
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,049
classes for settlement and foe change

687
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,230
though these things aren't going to

688
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:56,940
support 5g for a while but if you're in

689
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,490
this business and you're trying to learn

690
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,130
more about phones you need to look at

691
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:05,040
some of these things they gives you some

692
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,720
good insight and load them up on your

693
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:11,070
machine now family had any problems with

694
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:16,290
any I'm breaking into my phone you have

695
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:19,290
to run location services to have them

696
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:22,280
work right which is too bad but anyway

697
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:26,340
they work if you run those services

698
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:28,168
Network issues with 5g okay you guys

699
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,269
probably been waiting for this well this

700
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:32,070
is a very short

701
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:34,200
because there's just not that much

702
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,349
information out there yeah

703
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,059
high throughput low latency and best

704
00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:41,489
buffering you can possibly get on your

705
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,839
routers that face it and the other thing

706
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:44,369
is happening I don't know what you guys

707
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:49,499
have seen this yet that Nvidia

708
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:52,228
introduced a new edge chip that allows

709
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:56,999
you to have a lot more information right

710
00:32:52,229 --> 00:33:00,539
on the edge of the network so the what

711
00:32:56,999 --> 00:33:02,789
you're going to see is more and more big

712
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:05,549
globs of information coming from these

713
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:08,070
little chips as they refresh their cache

714
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:12,149
and they go I have to look stuff up and

715
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:16,950
then a lot less of the small queries

716
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:20,248
that you see today and low latency

717
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:22,559
applications written for 5g may not work

718
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:25,679
on a 4G network there may be a race

719
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,570
condition or it may not be able to one I

720
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,940
mentioned earlier like the car to car

721
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:32,070
communication that's not gonna work

722
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,279
right on the 540 Network but nobody

723
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:36,989
would expect it to now here's the thing

724
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,200
if you're a nurse if you're a programmer

725
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:45,149
you know somebody who is all the objects

726
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:47,159
are different like I said in the radios

727
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:50,639
different programmer has to identify

728
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,409
that and the objects like want to just

729
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:54,869
mentioned on the a draw Android phone

730
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:59,729
are different for 5g and 40 because the

731
00:33:54,869 --> 00:34:01,738
parameters are different now why are we

732
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:02,820
doing this well the answer is somebody's

733
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:05,969
going to start asking you questions

734
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,678
about 5g and I thought it only fair to

735
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:09,599
throw in a couple interview questions

736
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,789
and some hints about how to prepare for

737
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,980
this because I get answering to ask

738
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:16,049
questions about 5g and I like to ask and

739
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,049
like the answer I also like to ask them

740
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:22,649
but in order to get good answers you

741
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:26,038
have to ask good questions so cuts both

742
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:29,190
ways so here's one trick question does v

743
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:33,389
GPB replace 3gpp in developing 5g

744
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:35,159
standards this is the five 3gpp is the

745
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,859
standards from any of this developed

746
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:41,190
everything since GSM as well No

747
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:43,799
so it would be logical at five GPP would

748
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,800
replace it nope but they hung with

749
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,760
3gpp they just kept right on going to 4G

750
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,679
and 5g now millimeter waves you can get

751
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,170
an almost as many answers this question

752
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,300
is you want to but this is what I

753
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:59,250
thought was a definitive answer but you

754
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:03,180
guys and don't do anything except work

755
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:06,900
on cell phones and so are the 5 g and 6

756
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:11,240
g bands considered millimeter wave bands

757
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:13,950
no they're already in use 8 g is usually

758
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,189
thought of as a no later right but the

759
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:22,350
traditional millimeter wave band is RF

760
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:24,960
above 10 gigahertz and so 5 g 5 and 6

761
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:28,860
gigahertz bands are not millimeter waves

762
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,680
now if you're talking to uh salesman in

763
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:35,280
a store I think guarantee you they're

764
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,470
probably super millimeter waves but they

765
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,140
aren't technically no reader wipes you

766
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:42,180
got to give above 10 gigahertz by the

767
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:46,440
way that's the same break point we saw

768
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:48,629
earlier F R 1 and F R 2 the low end and

769
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:52,800
then everything about 24 gigahertz that

770
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:55,920
also falls that way and then there's a

771
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,380
somebody already has a list of interview

772
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,890
questions on 5g and there it is I've

773
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,420
given you a link to it and if you want

774
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:06,480
to learn a lot more about this I'm

775
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:09,000
pointed to really good directions the I

776
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,090
Triple E has at least 15 education

777
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,650
pieces on it there's a link to it and

778
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,630
the other guys that really do a good job

779
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,410
is probably a company you may not have

780
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,790
heard of called rodent shorts and

781
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:24,600
they're German company and they do

782
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:27,029
everything RF and they have some

783
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,700
outstanding papers so if you get

784
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,280
interested check out row - warts and

785
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,660
check out the I Triple E well that's

786
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,090
about it for now

787
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,700
I want to we're going to drop off here

788
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:41,790
thanks a lot for listening I hope we've

789
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,759
provided some good information we hope

790
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,890
we provided a little more clarity like I

791
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,480
said this is a very unclear field and I

792
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,790
honestly think some people are trying to

793
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,800
muddy the water even more so thanks a

794
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:57,480
lot and this is it you can send us

795
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,560
emails if you got more question

796
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,130
so we're going to take some questions

797
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,130
now

798
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:07,940
okay we have a few little demos here

799
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,680
it's kind of hard to demo here and you

800
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,410
know for zoom but this is a little

801
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,009
directional antenna cost 15 dollars this

802
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:17,899
runs at 850 to 950 guess what the band

803
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:20,270
that a lot of the US cellphones are on

804
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,790
so you can use this thing this is back

805
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:24,980
one RF put them together you can see the

806
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:29,839
phones coming and going on this thing

807
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:32,119
you can measure the where they are and

808
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,279
you can also get a good a feel for the

809
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,320
power all this little tool is not

810
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:40,520
accurate for giving you an accurate

811
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:43,430
measure on power measurements and the

812
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:51,170
software that you normally I use a lot I

813
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:56,868
put on a Linux machine Anna there it is

814
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:59,119
this is GPR gqr X and it acts like a

815
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:02,750
spectrum analyzer I'm running this off a

816
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,980
$20 little dongle here and you can get

817
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:07,369
these things anywhere

818
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:09,890
uber tooth one is a lot like yes I took

819
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:11,780
me about an hour and a half to put this

820
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,560
together so if you're interested in RF

821
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:18,830
your interesting thoughts this is easy

822
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:22,490
the setup with the equinox the total of

823
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:26,330
I think about $400 counting that the

824
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:29,419
radio the computer and the antenna this

825
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:32,060
one here PC was free and the thing cost

826
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,890
$20 don't be scared of it it's easy to

827
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:41,500
do well that's all I've got

828
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:41,500
thanks a lot for watching go Elizabeth

829
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,730
thanks a lot for that Joe that was

830
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,320
really interesting there are a couple of

831
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:51,140
questions that have come into the queue

832
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:55,400
the first question is why five six or

833
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:57,440
five G for enterprise deployments if you

834
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,080
have a mobile device that has to have

835
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,940
handoffs you go with a 5g otherwise you

836
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:06,160
go with the Wi-Fi it's kind of tricky to

837
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:09,260
get good mobile handoffs with Wi-Fi

838
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:13,040
that's why Disneyland I think chose 5g

839
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:15,950
is they have all those moving floats and

840
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,380
all kinds of stuff laying like that so

841
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:21,080
move around and they'll that they'll

842
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,970
have a continuous session with Wi-Fi you

843
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,819
got cut up repeater or some a bunch of

844
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:29,149
other stuff

845
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:31,760
next thanks a lot Joe the next question

846
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:35,540
is what in your opinion is a killer app

847
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,310
for 5g I would say selling something to

848
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,290
a venture capitalist would be the number

849
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:42,140
one killer app because somebody would

850
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:44,330
probably buy it right now but gaming is

851
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:47,290
up there they're wiring all the stadiums

852
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:49,580
and you have to believe that's for

853
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:52,160
on-premises betting or something so you

854
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,660
have super low latency it could also be

855
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,730
for something like you see for

856
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,580
advertising auctions where you need lay

857
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:00,950
low latency in a limited space or

858
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:03,350
something like that just think low

859
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,049
latency that makes sense

860
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:08,509
thank you the next question is is there

861
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:10,670
an expectation that 5g takes over the

862
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:12,170
entire footprint that 4G is servicing

863
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,460
now would you imagine that they'll run

864
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,380
as parallel networks serving different

865
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,000
purposes they'll probably run as

866
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,390
parallel networks for a long time just

867
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,940
because you don't need some of the

868
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:26,720
features of 5g and a lot of places and

869
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:29,690
it's expensive and so why do it and

870
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,730
there are only two standalone networks

871
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:35,210
now I think I answered this in another

872
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:37,700
question too but once in Korea ones

873
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,710
t-mobile and that means it's pure 5g and

874
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:45,770
it runs without any fortunately that

875
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:46,430
working runs to 5g convinced core okay

876
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,759
thank you

877
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:51,799
the next question is that the person

878
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,950
says I'd like to know more about private

879
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,080
5g networks can I have one that gateways

880
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,669
to the public telephone telephony net or

881
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,620
the Internet but I have one that is

882
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,990
completely private can I use one to ship

883
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,109
non IP data around between two stations

884
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:09,919
or can I create ad hoc networks between

885
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:11,870
vehicles the last one

886
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,590
which is I didn't answer earlier which

887
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:17,480
is if you ship a private non IP data

888
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,400
around you have to encapsulate it the

889
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,340
traffic quantifying to you network the

890
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,410
RF is IP so you're gonna have to do some

891
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,630
kind of thing there you don't have the

892
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:29,160
case where I can set up a dedicated link

893
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:31,260
like I do at 10:00 and 2g

894
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,730
just put anything I want down it no

895
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,780
can't do that

896
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:39,780
but as far as private networks our

897
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,760
little group of two here believes we've

898
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,010
been forecasting the private networks

899
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,470
are a really big deal now for four years

900
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:48,809
and there is one in existence

901
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:51,149
AT&T sells the first-responders network

902
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:52,950
that's really kind of not a private

903
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,349
network but I think they'll give you

904
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:58,049
your own dial plan and then a few other

905
00:41:55,349 --> 00:42:02,339
things but when you hit virtualization

906
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:05,069
in 5g do you have one anywhere and there

907
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:06,930
is one there's and in private networks

908
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:09,480
are already around there's a guy who

909
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:12,419
comes to Nanog or at least used to it

910
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,680
runs the Burning Man phone network and

911
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,609
that's a private network it has a

912
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,828
gateway to the BTS so I am to the under

913
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:23,190
cellular system he buys a link from

914
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:26,880
somebody and operates is a virtual

915
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:29,130
mobile operator via Moe so you have kind

916
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,930
of private networks as veamos now but

917
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:34,010
true Private Networks you're gonna have

918
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:38,640
to wait till you get oh man and

919
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:41,700
virtualization inside you okay thank you

920
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,788
the next question is which emailing list

921
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,950
to do you keep up with to keep up on 5g

922
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:49,170
progress now which of the email lists

923
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:51,089
would you recommend if you're doing it

924
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:54,690
internationally you can't get away

925
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:56,759
without either at least following tell a

926
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:58,980
Geography Bee they're really nice guys

927
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,829
and their blog will post almost

928
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,910
everything if you're really into it and

929
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:07,410
it's and you're having to be

930
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,328
internationally you gotta subscribe to

931
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,399
them and they're not cheap and if you

932
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:13,799
have to set up towers and bid for

933
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,079
bandwidth there's a million people you

934
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:17,849
can deal with and you'll find them they

935
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,920
make lists to towers they can tell you

936
00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:22,500
where to get the space everything now if

937
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,829
you're like guys for we spend more time

938
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:28,349
on figuring out what's going on then

939
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:31,140
then trying to figure out which pieces

940
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:33,930
spectrum we're gonna put a bid on then

941
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,520
our CR Wireless is very good there's

942
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,440
another lot of guys named fierce

943
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,240
Wireless and they're both they're also

944
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,029
really good and if you look around

945
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,410
you'll probably find a few more and

946
00:43:41,029 --> 00:43:45,480
rohde & schwarz has

947
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:48,149
and the I Triple E has a really good

948
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,000
blog on 5g as well and they have like 12

949
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:53,460
classes on 5g and so does rohde &

950
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,700
schwarz so if you you can educate

951
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:58,740
yourself to the point of being a real

952
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,180
expert and be ahead of some of the guys

953
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:04,379
that are out there hanging off the side

954
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:08,490
of a tower that makes a lot of sense

955
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:10,319
thank you the next question is is the

956
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:14,129
u.s. really that far behind the rest of

957
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,140
the world with 5g enough so why I don't

958
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:18,329
think they are we just don't have as

959
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,690
much a need for it though you see a lot

960
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:24,059
more of at the point for example Morocco

961
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,250
has been has every phone in the country

962
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:29,220
on 5g and it's been that way now for two

963
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:31,289
years because they have the money

964
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:35,220
there's only 3500 phones in the whole

965
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:36,539
country so you know so are we behind

966
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,959
them because we're not a hundred percent

967
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:41,670
though and some people have to use it

968
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,799
like China because they have too many

969
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:46,200
have a very high density environments

970
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:49,190
they need high bandwidth and low

971
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:52,649
frequency I mean at high frequencies so
