1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
[Music]

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,659
you

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,659
[Music]

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:17,920
so the next speaker to join us is Susan

5
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:20,200
Forney Susan is a network engineer from

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,320
Hurricane electric and scared to talk to

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:27,880
us about ipv6 adoption over internet

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,559
exchanges Susan hello it's good to

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,738
virtually be with everyone

10
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:35,379
unlike many people I'm actually giving

11
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:37,180
this presentation from Boston where the

12
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:39,370
meeting was supposed to be held before

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,800
we had to have it virtually so I

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,899
actually did get to realize my dream of

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,819
presenting in Boston and Auggie even

16
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:51,519
though technically I'm in Dedham so very

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:53,350
happy to be here today so first I would

18
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:57,280
like to start my presentation by giving

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:01:00,600
a low pro ipv6 disclaimer hurricane

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,839
Electric has worked to advance ipv6

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:09,010
deployments globally and and is a strong

22
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:11,440
advocator by pv6 we started routing ipv6

23
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:15,220
on our network in 2000 and we received

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:20,009
our first ipv6 public allocation in 2001

25
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:25,480
we completed a native ipv6 conversion in

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:28,330
2007 we peer with more essence over ipv6

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,160
than any other network and if you're

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,140
wondering how many that is it's five

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,220
thousand two hundred twenty-nine today

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,840
we also peer with more ASNs over ipv4

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,650
than any other network but today's talk

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,650
is about ipv6

33
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:55,229
ipv6 adoption is important because now

34
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,298
that ipv4 is depleted from two with five

35
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,719
our IRS which of course are erin and

36
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,549
ripe with lacks nick scheduled to or

37
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,098
prison or projected to join them in

38
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,929
august it's probably time to take a look

39
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:10,348
at how internet exchanges have

40
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:13,860
progressed in operating up and deploying

41
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:15,720
IP adopting ipv6 i started out with a

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,239
couple of basic assumptions first that

43
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,910
internet exchanges are historically

44
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,040
where we grow the internet as internet

45
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,640
operators internet exchanges have been

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,640
where we drive change and then secondly

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,670
that if we were increasing IP v traffic

48
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:41,458
across exchanges we would we would start

49
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:43,379
that by increasing ipv6 peering the

50
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,260
development of internet exchanges has

51
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:49,950
shaped the inner industry and here are a

52
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:53,429
few ipv6 and internet exchange facts to

53
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:56,040
keep mine first twenty seven percent of

54
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,680
all existing networks advertise ipv6

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,239
prefixes and of the six hundred and

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,239
eighty-eight internet exchanges

57
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,630
worldwide twenty new external net

58
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,000
exchanges were formed in 2019 clearly

59
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,430
intern exchanges are still a vital part

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,549
of networking landscape and necessary as

61
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,680
a matter of fact already this year three

62
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:20,040
new internet exchanges have formed and

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,919
the newest one in north america is quad

64
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,310
city IX in davenport iowa i like to give

65
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,919
a shout out for them for just joining us

66
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,069
so they're the newest ones also peers

67
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,450
are more likely to route ipv6

68
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,810
statistically if they persuade them in

69
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,810
exchange

70
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:45,480
so to get started with how exchanges are

71
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:48,000
deploying ipv6 first I decided to start

72
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,950
looking at the top 20 internet exchanges

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,500
by members just to get an idea give you

74
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,950
an idea of how big and exchanges impacts

75
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:00,480
are the largest internet exchange in the

76
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:03,450
world is BRX in Sao Paulo and they have

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,750
over 1,500 members so there's obviously

78
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,040
a lot you can get done there in terms of

79
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,370
reducing latency and increasing

80
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,459
throughput the next largest one is in

81
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,440
Europe VIX Frankfurt and six is there

82
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,010
along with links one of the very first

83
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:25,770
internet exchanges data IX e picks and

84
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:27,900
cata BK moscow IX France IX n LAX and

85
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,299
the Netherlands again that lends also

86
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,479
big booster of the internet and have a

87
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,880
lot of busy exchanges nap Africa in

88
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,320
Johannesburg is the 10th one the tenth

89
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,159
largest in the world right now

90
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:45,030
France IX and Equinix Paris PTT and Rio

IX in Hong Kong those are the largest

95
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,119
internet exchanges in the world you

96
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,250
notice that of the large in exchanges

97
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,120
the bulk of them have between 300 and

98
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,740
400 members and how I started thinking

99
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,860
about this talk actually was I was

100
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,620
turning up some new peers and European

101
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,960
exchanges and these particular networks

102
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,770
had preferred me to their period IDI

103
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,138
page 2 you get the information for

104
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,930
setting up the peers and so although

105
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,490
they had IP beef add anti p v6 addresses

106
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,020
listed there and I turned them up and

107
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,479
they didn't come up I contacted the

108
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,859
peers said hey the v4 came up the b6

109
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,190
didn't and they said oh well I don't

110
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,349
really have ipv6 and I thought well

111
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,449
that's kind of weird you know you have

112
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,740
ipv6 address but you're not peering over

113
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,930
it and that's when I started wondering

114
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,520
how prevalent that really was and that's

115
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:50,990
how this talk I started so the first

116
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,990
thing I'd like to look at is

117
00:05:51,850 --> 00:06:00,710
the global trends so there are a lot to

118
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,570
absorb and I thought that if we took a

119
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,729
look at the regions that this would be a

120
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,690
lot easier to figure out what actually

121
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:10,280
was going on internet exchanges I

122
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,230
thought that we'd take a look at the

123
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,440
regions in the world and compare them to

124
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,600
North America since we're at Nanog and

125
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,740
how I measured this progress was I

126
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,500
looked at the number of ipv6 addresses

127
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,169
that are listed or assigned for each

128
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,470
exchange to each member and then I

129
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:33,349
looked at how many of those IP addresses

130
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,690
were actually me chable and then I

131
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,120
compared how many reachable ipv6

132
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,130
addresses against how many reachable

133
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,290
ipv4 addresses there were on each

134
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,750
exchange to determine who is able to

135
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,070
appear over the ipv6 exchange and the

136
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,530
reason why I decided to do this was

137
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,680
because almost everybody peers on the

138
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,989
exchanges with ipv4 and it didn't seem

139
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,820
reasonable to compare to the number of

140
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,490
lists just the number of lists of

141
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:02,540
exchange IP addresses that were assigned

142
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,400
so it seemed more by more logical just

143
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,410
to compare two of the people who are

144
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,390
actually appearing on the exchange the

145
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,850
people who have active ipv4 addresses

146
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,740
how many of them have reachable ipv6

147
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,280
addresses which is where I got that bulk

148
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,280
of this data

149
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:22,810
and again this is kind of a quick

150
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:25,330
snapshot of how I did that I gathered

151
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,400
the IPS I looked at how many were

152
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,349
reachable and then I calculated the

153
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:38,979
ratio and in the graphs I expressed

154
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:41,110
Rachel as a percentage so Europe has

155
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,789
literally led the way in forming

156
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,909
internet exchanges so I'm going to start

157
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:50,199
looking at them first a little European

158
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:51,909
IX tribute includes that of the 688 in

159
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,960
the next changes I previously mentioned

160
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:57,610
six 261 of those are in Europe which is

161
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,370
over a third of the exchanges in the

162
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,080
world are in Europe the person the

163
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,750
exchanges in the world were established

164
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,719
in Europe and peers are more likely to

165
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:11,110
have both an ipv4 and ipv6 ferry session

166
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:16,810
on the European exchange their big

167
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:19,930
boosters of ipv6 so the first of the the

168
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:23,979
first exchanges I looked at were the the

169
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:26,800
top 10 exchanges in the in Europe and he

170
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:29,110
picks and kind of ek is uh yes the top

171
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,250
one has the as the most I signed if he

172
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,740
address this a little over a hundred

173
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,179
percent and you say well how can there

174
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,140
be a little over 100 percent well that's

175
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:40,870
because a lot of a lot of exchanges a

176
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,689
network might have only one ipv4 address

177
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,050
but they might have you know two three

178
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,380
four eight ipv6 addresses so the number

179
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:52,029
of the assigned ipv6 addresses can

180
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,110
actually be higher than the number of

181
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:59,019
ice assigned ipv4 addresses Equinix

182
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,510
Paris D cux Frankfurt in France ax all

183
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:03,490
super close that data I X and M and

184
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,689
Moscow exile super close to a hundred

185
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,060
percent

186
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:10,660
he picks Warsaw you know coming in just

187
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,489
a little bit farther and then n Li X is

188
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,219
the lowest with about seventy nine

189
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,230
percent so you know most places they

190
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,180
have if you have a v4 address you

191
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,180
haven't assigned v6 at European exchange

192
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:27,709
but if we go down and we look at now how

193
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,140
many of those IP addresses that were

194
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:32,239
signed are actually reachable it's a

195
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,250
little bit different picture the blue

196
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,709
bars are still the number s I have

197
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,930
assigned addresses but the orange bars

198
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,560
are the number of addresses that are

199
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,630
actually reachable on the exchange and

200
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,140
like for instance where Kennedy -

201
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:50,480
Kennedy they had one of the highest

202
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,339
number of assigned ipv6 addresses they

203
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,070
actually have one of the lower numbers

204
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:57,500
of reachable ipv6 addresses on the

205
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:01,750
exchange so we're actually you can

206
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:06,019
actually pain same thing in epics or saw

207
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:11,029
data IX France IX Moscow X a little bit

208
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:15,290
lower the bringing in the the top honors

209
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:18,160
was NL IX and blinks and juniper are

210
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:21,260
blinks the juniper LAN and AM sex also

211
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:25,370
defects Frankfurt doing very well all of

212
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:29,180
them you know between 80 85 % and I made

213
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,519
some up to 90 percent of reachable IP

214
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,199
addresses but not what their initial

215
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,899
numbers would have suggested we're just

216
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:38,229
about everybody on the exchange has ipv6

217
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,230
address

218
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:47,930
so while Europe is senior among ixs I'm

219
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:50,360
indisputably Africa it could be kind of

220
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,300
characterized as the New Kids on the

221
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,190
Block in internet exchanges those

222
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,740
networks are expanding across the

223
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,050
African continent rapidly and new

224
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,870
exchanges are developing everywhere

225
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,870
helping those networks across that

226
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:09,290
continent be more diverse and get better

227
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,550
throughput and just because they're new

228
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,650
doesn't mean they're small

229
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,810
now if Africa in Johannesburg just crack

230
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:17,350
the top ten largest internet exchanges

231
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:20,780
in the world so they're very busy and

232
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,180
Africans Internet infrastructure is very

233
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,069
diverse there are 54 countries in that

234
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,410
continent and they're developing very

235
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:30,080
rapidly and Britain turning up at

236
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,800
exchanges so let's take a look at where

237
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,870
they are as far as assigned IP addresses

238
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,510
so then again if we look at this graph

239
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:42,170
we see that most of them are between 90

240
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:44,420
and over a hundred percent nap Africa

241
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,240
has about a hundred and twelve percent

242
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:51,709
then I looked at nap Africa in Cape Town

243
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:57,040
nap Africa and urban thinks the Durban

244
00:11:51,710 --> 00:12:03,680
IX ki XP and Nairobi Kenya X and

245
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:05,510
Djibouti and Gen jinkx and I apologise

246
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,150
for any of the names I am massacring

247
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:11,689
because not sure how to pronounce all of

248
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:13,430
them anyway so all of those have a high

249
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,850
amount of assigned at the addresses but

250
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:21,500
then we go down to the next slide and we

251
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:29,300
see that not quite that far just the

252
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:31,070
next slide right we see that the

253
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,130
reachable IP addresses aren't as they

254
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:37,400
aren't quite at gain quite as good the

255
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,370
the highest is jinx with 79 percent and

256
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,459
the lowest is Cape Town Africa

257
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:48,800
yeah Cape Town nap Africa with with just

258
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:50,150
22% and and in some respects you know

259
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,130
when you're starting out the internet

260
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,769
that is kind of to be expected

261
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:58,850
but the numbers could be obviously a lot

262
00:12:54,769 --> 00:13:01,730
higher so the next region I looked at

263
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,500
was asia-pacific it's a broad region

264
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,509
with unique challenges different

265
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,850
challenges than the other four regions

266
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:10,069
were looking at today because a lot of

267
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,959
the reason is wiling this is dispersed

268
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,490
throughout the Pacific Ocean meaning if

269
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,949
they have to be connected via a lot of

270
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,199
transatlantic cables and so internet

271
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:22,819
exchanges keeping local traffic global

272
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:24,529
can be very important also agen Asia you

273
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:27,680
know big part of the region the cities

274
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:29,870
have very dense populations ipv4

275
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,449
addresses have not been a plentiful in

276
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,160
Asia and and they have embraced ipv6

277
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:36,439
because it's one bit is available to

278
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,630
them so there are good adopters of ipv6

279
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:44,839
and an Asian saying ISPs have obviously

280
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:47,029
embraced that so let's take a look at

281
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,519
where they are as far as assigned IP

282
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:52,519
addresses and again we see that they

283
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,220
just to you know you can see most of

284
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,850
them have ipv6 assigned and I was

285
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,600
looking at in Asia a JP Knapp HK IX and

286
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,319
Hong Kong

287
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:09,050
JP IX in Tokyo Equinix Singapore

288
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:12,769
TP IX and Taiwan kinks in Korea in Seoul

289
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:16,130
mega port in Sydney mega port in

290
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:18,680
Melbourne Auckland IX and also

291
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,839
Philippines IX which most say I looked

292
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,029
at because hurricane just turned up

293
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,449
there so we were available so I can see

294
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,839
what was going on there and then if you

295
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:33,290
look at the next slide you can see that

296
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,449
it's again pretty actually pretty

297
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:39,500
impressive honestly for the Pacific

298
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:42,620
region most of these I exes have high

299
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,189
penetration of the IPV signed ipv6

300
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:51,860
addresses are available to peer on the

301
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:56,300
Philippines IX is is not as as high it's

302
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:58,389
only about 35% Oakland IX is a little

303
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,559
bit lower

304
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,480
Melbourne and sit and Sydney are a

305
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,510
little bit lower but most the other axes

306
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,080
are very very

307
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:11,170
active hearing environments and in ipv6

308
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:17,060
and a lot of people participating so

309
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:19,219
Asia is as expected is pretty good and

310
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,500
then because we're Nana I saved North

311
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:26,060
American internet exchanges for last

312
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:29,480
so Erin was the first rir to exhaust its

313
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:32,030
allocation so let's take a look yeah

314
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,640
that lit a fire under anybody in the

315
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:37,040
North American exchanges so again we're

316
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,920
gonna look at this slide that tells me

317
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:45,740
which of the top exchanges i looked at

318
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:48,290
and in the US any to los angeles was the

319
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:52,280
one that had the highest penetration of

320
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:55,699
assigned addresses then we looked at NY

321
00:15:52,280 --> 00:16:01,550
IX and the six in seattle d kicks new

322
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:04,400
york Equinix san jose toronto x dr

323
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,219
atlanta Equinix chicago Equinix Alice

324
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,459
and Equinix Ashburn was the large I exes

325
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,860
in us and those ones we looked at and

326
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:16,160
then if we go down to the next slide you

327
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:21,010
see that yeah you know it does seem like

328
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:25,969
it it's pretty impressive the the lowest

329
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:30,350
amount of ipv6 or reachable addresses

330
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:32,540
was in Toronto at 57% so by far you know

331
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,790
the the difference between they're the

332
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,730
lowest of it yeah you know on their 50%

333
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,250
one percent is pretty good it it does

334
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:43,760
show that ipv6 is being deployed pretty

335
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,070
enthusiastically in these in these Davis

336
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,030
in these exchanges and that there's a

337
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,560
lot of participation

338
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:53,240
it's high in most of those exchanges so

339
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,630
when I was doing another talk last year

340
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,280
I I was doing some research on the

341
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:02,750
percentage of a population that are

342
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:05,329
Internet users and what I discovered was

343
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:09,740
that there definitely is a correlation

344
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:11,439
between how high a saturation you have

345
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,450
of Internet users in your population

346
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,580
versus how much ipv6 is deployed and

347
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,569
this would explain a lot of the

348
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:22,740
differences that we saw

349
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:25,829
the inn in Europe and and Asia and in to

350
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,420
a certain extend

351
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,850
I'm not really sure why it happened in

352
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,540
Toronto that's pretty good internet

353
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:37,860
participation but what the maybe they

354
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,690
just need to work harder but but it does

355
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,330
there is a correlation so it would

356
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,730
explain that why in the Philippines the

357
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,730
Internet the ipv6 was a little bit lower

358
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:50,130
and why in some parts of Africa the

359
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,450
internet part B internet ipv6

360
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,190
participation was a little bit lower

361
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,350
because the percentage of the population

362
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,090
their internet user in those places is a

363
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,120
little bit lower especially compared to

364
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,520
places like Europe and and that has an

365
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,469
impact on development our deployment of

366
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,460
ipv6 because when you're just trying to

367
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,860
get Network started obviously

368
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,040
everybody's on ipv4 that would be your

369
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,810
priority so it means that that there is

370
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,430
kind of a reason why that happened and

371
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,840
but it still means we have a lot of work

372
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:20,780
to do in those areas because we still

373
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,780
have to deploy ipv6 everywhere so

374
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:28,500
overall I guess what these figures show

375
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,300
you is that you can assign a network and

376
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,710
ipv6 address but you can't make them

377
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:37,610
peer based on what we saw though I think

378
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,710
a few assumptions still seem reasonable

379
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,840
ipv6 routing is actively encouraged on

380
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,000
internet exchanges the internet

381
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,909
exchanges deploy ipv6 on the route

382
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,830
servers and many of them assign ipv6

383
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,470
space automatically with the ipv4

384
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,629
addresses and that's an important

385
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,400
partnership in deploying ipv6 and they

386
00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:00,210
really should be recognized for how hard

387
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,560
they work at it a large person as a

388
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,530
percentage of peering networks are

389
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,929
routing ipv6 and on most exchanges the

390
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,670
number of networks is higher than the

391
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,830
number of networks participating in

392
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,210
routing ipv6 is higher than the global

393
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,000
average of twenty seven point three

394
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,370
percent on all AAS ends so that shows

395
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,160
you that internet exchanges are you know

396
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:23,939
where ipv6 is being deployed and where

397
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,340
it's being promoted and if a network

398
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,990
isn't peering over ipv6 it's probably

399
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,290
because it does not have ipv6 deployed

400
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,710
if

401
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:37,370
if you also if you average the all of

402
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:41,400
the of all the ipv6 deployment

403
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:43,949
statistics I I showed I averaged on all

404
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,040
the internet exchanges how many networks

405
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:50,490
where each will be a ipv6 and it came to

406
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,330
54 percent which is about double the

407
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,280
global average

408
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,760
so again proof that those internet

409
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,629
exchanges are actively participating in

410
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:06,980
ipv6 and and making and making good

411
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,980
progress so

412
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:21,969
looks like here Aaron exhausted its ipv4

413
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:25,070
allocation in September of 2015 and ripe

414
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:28,070
just distributed its last allocation

415
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:31,330
last year in November and the remaining

416
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:34,250
our IRS don't have a lot of time left so

417
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:38,000
if you're wondering you know why you

418
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,799
should worry about this there isn't

419
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,190
going to be a lot of ipv4 address

420
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:46,100
available two hours to read to to

421
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:49,660
allocate and name thinking well I can

422
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,159
that well yes you can't at but cgn

423
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,870
solutions still require additional IP

424
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,059
space unless your network is not going

425
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,469
to grow at all daddy won't won't solve

426
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:00,559
your problems you still will need

427
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:04,880
additional IP space and yes you can

428
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:09,520
still buy IP addresses now I I P address

429
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:15,080
the current pricing is is $21 per IP v

430
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:18,500
per IP address for 8/24 or 23 or 22 and

431
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,149
this is up a bit because once upon a

432
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,520
time when we weren't really selling IP

433
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,740
address space there was a question on

434
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:30,139
how much I appeal an IP address was

435
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,790
worth and in 2011 Microsoft kind of

436
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,190
answered that question when it bought

437
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,889
six hundred sixty six thousand six

438
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:39,559
hundred and twenty four addresses for

439
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:44,360
seven point five million dollars Nortel

440
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:47,299
and that put that figure at about $11.25

441
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,909
an IP address and that gave the answer

442
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:51,950
to how much on IP address costs

443
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,870
obviously in the last nine years that

444
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,870
price has edged up a little bit now it's

445
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,549
almost double depending on who you

446
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,459
believe there are people who think that

447
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:04,660
IP address prices could double again

448
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,660
over the next two years

449
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,830
is there there was a recent development

450
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,720
saying at the end of 2019 saying that

451
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:19,678
the US Department of Defense was

452
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,830
planning on selling over 200 million IP

453
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:29,130
addresses and I believe that was the

454
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:31,049
equivalent of about 12/8 and they have

455
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,370
indicated that they would not sell them

456
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,139
all at once and that they would be

457
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,080
selling them in large blocks over the

458
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,750
next 10 years that may or may not have

459
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,199
an impact on the market it's definitely

460
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:45,600
good news for you know people who have

461
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,000
lots of content or maybe cloud providers

462
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,439
who need lots of IP space and are

463
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,789
wondering where they're gonna get it so

464
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,980
that might give them a little bit of a

465
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:54,929
reprieve for the rest of the networks

466
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,030
they probably still everybody have a

467
00:22:54,929 --> 00:23:01,799
hard time getting their hands on ipv4

468
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:03,658
space and to take a look at whether or

469
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:07,650
not this is actually causing any

470
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:10,140
pressure on the market I looked at ipv4

471
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,030
transactions at since they seem to be

472
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,760
increasing year-over-year and from the

473
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:17,879
our IRS and if you look at this graph

474
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:21,690
here which I got from Jeff Houston at

475
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:25,049
his on his site you can see that there

476
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:28,200
are there is definitely pressure on the

477
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:29,400
lack of ipv4 addresses on either which

478
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,669
is reflected through the amount of

479
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,299
transfers the blue line is Aaron which

480
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:39,960
you know has just continually gone up

481
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:42,210
the gray line is ripe ripe had an

482
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,190
anomaly where they changed their policy

483
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:48,840
which affected how many transfers

484
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:51,630
happened in 2015 and 2016 so it's not

485
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,689
like the 2015 exhaustion that Aaron had

486
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,669
any big definite effect on ripe it's

487
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,980
more of the policy change but still you

488
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:05,190
can see that the trajectory is up it

489
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:07,350
mirrors it mirrors Aaron and APNIC house

490
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,669
has been pretty steady lack NIC has been

491
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,340
pretty steady even though they're about

492
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:15,000
to learn the by P addresses but this

493
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:18,870
does indicate that especially since most

494
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,210
of the Aaron has

495
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,580
most IP addresses to transfer around of

496
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,870
any of any of the our IRS and it does

497
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:33,500
indicate there is some pressure we ipv6

498
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:33,500
and scarcity of ipv4 addresses so I

499
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,920
think that it's it's clear that the

500
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,830
increasing number of transaction is a

501
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,930
reflection of demand and and demand will

502
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,360
result increasing that price of ipv4

503
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:47,280
space so well it might you know I don't

504
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,840
know what you know what your odds are of

505
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,550
doubling it but definitely the price

506
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,550
seems like it's going to go what and

507
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:55,620
soon the availability of ipv4 addresses

508
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:58,919
will only be through your friendly IP

509
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:01,409
address brokers and as more users were

510
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,690
added to the internet demand for ipv4

511
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,730
addresses arise the one thing you have

512
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,590
to remember is that not everybody in the

513
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,590
world is on the Internet even right now

514
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:13,040
and because of that well as more users

515
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:16,050
are added more IP addresses are needed

516
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,730
marketing a transfer of legacy ipv4

517
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,220
blocks means most networks will be able

518
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,470
to get IP space for the foreseeable

519
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,880
future but demand and speculation are

520
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:33,540
going to continue to put pressure on

521
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:39,000
price and to give you an idea of you

522
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:42,510
know how that might happen higher prices

523
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,880
are good news for ipv6 deployment but

524
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,950
not but not for all the obvious reasons

525
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,160
you're thinking because people have to

526
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:53,700
pay more it's also because it's driven

527
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,170
mobile providers too and a lot of energy

528
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,590
services and these are service providers

529
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,820
to ipv6 so they avoid the problem of

530
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:03,389
where they where they're going to get

531
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,129
ipv4 addresses for all of their users if

532
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,710
you as a provider make your service

533
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,929
available over ipv6 you don't have to

534
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:12,420
rely on six to four tools and you can

535
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:14,220
access those users directly and as you

536
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,710
can see the number of people who are

537
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,230
accessing the Internet over mobile

538
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:25,740
devices is increasing it went from about

539
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:29,250
35% of users in 2015 to nearly 54% of

540
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:32,519
users in 2019 so if the trend is up

541
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,809
people more people are develop our axe

542
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,809
see the internet from their phone or

543
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:38,489
their mobile device and so if you if you

544
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:41,759
want to reach them and you want to reach

545
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:43,589
them what more efficiently being on ipv6

546
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,039
is in your best benefit in your best

547
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:46,039
interest

548
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:55,619
so it's obvious that more appearing on

549
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,799
the internet will drive more ipv6

550
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:01,769
deployment what might not be as obvious

551
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,799
to network operators is that encouraging

552
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:07,049
the growth of ipv6 networks works in

553
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:11,070
favor of those of you who just don't

554
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:13,019
want to get off of ipv4 and the reason

555
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,139
for that is because when more traffic

556
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:19,470
moves to ipv6 it lessens the demand for

557
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:22,379
those ipv4 resources so you're hoping to

558
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,210
be able to hang out on ipv4 forever and

559
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:27,509
not have to worry about where your IP

560
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,369
addresses for coming from then the best

561
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:33,029
strategy for you is to encourage

562
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:37,350
everyone that you know to peer over ipv6

563
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:40,230
so there's more IPD space for you and so

564
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:43,019
but if you do it differently ipv6 it

565
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,330
puts pressure on the ipv4 supply and

566
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:47,549
that increases prices and the cost of

567
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,759
operating networks so if you want to

568
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:52,470
keep prices down and and your cost your

569
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,539
operating network down then you want to

570
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,239
be on ipv6 and if you don't want to be

571
00:27:54,539 --> 00:28:00,210
an ipv6 and you want and you want to

572
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:01,710
have IP space and lower prices then if

573
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,289
you need to encourage everyone else to

574
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,419
do it so you know win-win either way

575
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:08,158
whether you want I figure six or not you

576
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:17,489
should be encouraging everyone to be on

577
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:19,559
ipv6 so if you think about more in that

578
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:21,779
if you think about more networks need to

579
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:25,590
route traffic over ipv6 you can do

580
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:27,659
something about it when you turn a when

581
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:30,119
you start a new peering arrangement ask

582
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:32,309
the network for their ipv6 information

583
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,799
and turn up by B B's Experian at the

584
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:37,440
same time just because someone didn't

585
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,600
offer you their ipv6 addresses doesn't

586
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,730
mean they aren't using them frequently

587
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,158
when I turn up peers they don't

588
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:46,499
volunteer the ipv6 information and I'm

589
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,350
from Hurricane electric so it never

590
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:52,019
hurts to ask to get that ipv6 address it

591
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:54,658
takes very little effort to turn up the

592
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:56,099
ipv4 session along with the ipv6 so you

593
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,369
might as well do it while you have them

594
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:58,369
there

595
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:05,330
now after you get that session up

596
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:08,080
advertise your ipv6 prefixes and ask

597
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:11,120
other networks to advertise there's

598
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,699
frequently when I turn up an ipv6 peer I

599
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,860
go back and I check and I see that they

600
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,250
aren't advertising any prefixes to us

601
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,419
and now sometimes of course you know

602
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,130
when you turn up up here you don't

603
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,780
necessarily start advertising your

604
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,070
prefixes Navy your policy and your

605
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,860
network is that you have to wait for me

606
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,450
this window before you make a technical

607
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,060
change the network and advertising

608
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:34,730
prefix is a change so you might not see

609
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,860
that right away but if you go back like

610
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,170
I have with some peers and you see after

611
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,629
six months these people still are not

612
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:44,060
advertising their prefixes to you it is

613
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,430
time to give them an email or a call and

614
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,950
ask them to do that just think of it as

615
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,600
peer pressure and make sure that you are

616
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,280
getting those routes from all those

617
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,000
people or you turned up those ports

618
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,040
because after all if you are having if

619
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,530
you have to admit on the internet

620
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,270
exchange you might as well get as much

621
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:04,639
traffic across it as possible you're

622
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:07,370
already paying for it so make sure you

623
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,190
get those ipv6 traffic on and get that

624
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:13,790
port used

625
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:16,190
so in summary what I'd like to remind

626
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:18,200
you is that ipv6 participation on

627
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:21,470
internet exchanges is better than the

628
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,660
global average of 30 20 27 percent as we

629
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,010
said about 54 percent so things are

630
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,660
looking good these are looking pretty

631
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:29,840
good on a few exchanges while there's

632
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,580
room for improvement and while ipv6

633
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,100
adoption continues to increase

634
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,310
ipv4 is here to stay for the foreseeable

635
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,620
future and no matter what your protocol

636
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:42,879
politics are increasing peering over

637
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:45,139
ipv6 will help you meet your objectives

638
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,250
thank you very much for your time

639
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,250
do you have any questions

640
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,460
thank you very much Susan

641
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,678
I've got a couple questions that have

642
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,649
come through for you first one on the

643
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,740
list is there a complete list of I exes

644
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:09,729
perhaps a list of my exes with ipv6

645
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:12,850
enabled route servers yeah there is a

646
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:15,309
list that some several people provide a

647
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:18,850
list of internet exchanges hurricane

648
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:20,500
Electric has one at BGP on HDNet and if

649
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:23,709
you look at the exchange report you'll

650
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:28,269
see a list of all of the exchanges that

651
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:30,159
we know about and that they have we have

652
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:33,100
information about what they have a route

653
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,799
server or not and information all their

654
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,240
IP space and who's at the exchange so if

655
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:42,309
you take a look at that that would give

656
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:44,559
you a good idea yeah awesome next

657
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:48,690
question up how did you determine reach

658
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:52,330
ability on the exchanges ICMP kind of

659
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:54,549
what I the reason why I did this talk

660
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:56,678
was because hurricane is at all of those

661
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:58,570
exchanges so it gave me the opportunity

662
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,630
to be able to look at them and instead

663
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:04,029
of ICMP what I did was I used the ARP

664
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,850
table and the neighbor discovery table I

665
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:09,880
pinged all of the addresses in the in

666
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,649
the exchange before I took the art table

667
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,019
of the neighbor discovery table and then

668
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:15,879
as you know Susan Pink's finished I just

669
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:18,250
you know dumped the table and took a

670
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,750
look at what was there I thought that

671
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,820
was better than King in case somebody

672
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,429
was blocking some people block pings so

673
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,809
just to be on the safe side if they're

674
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:29,010
in the ARP table or their neighbor

675
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:33,908
discovery table I knew they're reachable

676
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:36,158
very good next question up we did not

677
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:37,929
see India and China in your presentation

678
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,429
what's the situation in those countries

679
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:44,350
well again again the reason why I did

680
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:45,880
this talk was because we're in a lot of

681
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,620
internet exchanges unfortunately

682
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,919
hurricane does not have a presence in

683
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,689
India or China we are in Hong Kong but I

684
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:54,909
couldn't really pretend that I could

685
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,620
characterize China from just a presence

686
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:59,909
in Hong Kong so that's why I didn't talk

687
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,908
about those particular countries

688
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,860
reasonable enough let's see what else we

689
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,679
got

690
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:15,280
have you seen any v6 peering with RFC

691
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,280
55:49 yet before NL RI with v6 next top

692
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:24,709
not not me personally no I have it I'm

693
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:27,770
you know if it's v6 hurricane peers with

694
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,390
it so there it's possible that we're

695
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:35,570
doing at some place but I personally

696
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:38,540
have not seen that here's a great one

697
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,490
how can we expect end-users to adopt v6

698
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:45,230
when the core providers are not offering

699
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:46,700
full ipv6 reachability yet well I think

700
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,890
that's kind of a chicken and the egg

701
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,590
question you know but at the end of the

702
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,360
day if you build they will come and you

703
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:56,629
know all of us are working very hard to

704
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:59,689
to you know create a complete you know

705
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:02,600
reachable v6 internet for everyone and

706
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,940
the more places that you that you turn

707
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,370
up v6 the more compelling you make it it

708
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,899
you know it if we all work together to

709
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,250
build it it's going to happen if we sit

710
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,739
on the sidelines and wait for it to

711
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,659
happen it's not gonna happen so the big

712
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:16,339
point of this talk was to you know point

713
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,250
out that we're doing very well on the

714
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,869
inner exchanges they they provide a

715
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:23,960
environment for us to you know to get

716
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:25,159
this promoted but it isn't enough you

717
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:30,740
know where there's more that we can do

718
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:35,210
so we could do better well said and

719
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:36,949
final question we have the key men I may

720
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:41,179
have missed it in your slides but how

721
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:44,168
was the v6 adoption vary by country vary

722
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:46,369
by country well it does seem to me that

723
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:49,549
what I was talking about in that one

724
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:51,919
slide about the the internet penetration

725
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,980
of Internet in an adoption of Internet

726
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:57,049
in a country versus the amount of v6 I

727
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,240
saw in the exchanges in those regions

728
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:02,270
there seems to be a correlation in that

729
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,350
and I think that's because the you know

730
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:06,020
if you're just trying to get the

731
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,520
Internet up obviously you need ipv4 you

732
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,470
know that you've got to have that you're

733
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,930
not going to connect to everything so

734
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,640
that is everyone's priority and so you

735
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,049
see these six lag a little bit

736
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:21,890
those places and I think that's probably

737
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:24,170
why indeed well that seems to be all the

738
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,799
questions we have for you thank you very

739
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,920
much Susan

740
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:30,200
excellent presentation as always thank

741
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,890
you very much for having me you bet

742
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:40,618
and thanks everyone for for coming

743
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:40,618
