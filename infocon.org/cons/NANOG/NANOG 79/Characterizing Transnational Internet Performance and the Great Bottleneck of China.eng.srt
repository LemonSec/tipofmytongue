00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,659
Hey

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,659
[Music]

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,440
I would like to introduce our next

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:17,020
speaker Paul Jean G from University of

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,660
California Riverside he will be

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,279
presenting on characterizing

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,540
transnational Internet performance and a

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,540
great bottleneck of China

9
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:33,680
hi everyone my name is Tom Gyeongju I am

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:38,600
a PhD candidate at the rivers unit

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,570
University of California Riverside this

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,300
the talk I will be presenting today is

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,790
titled characterizing global

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,578
transnational internet performance and

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:53,180
is bottleneck this is a collaboration

16
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:59,330
with University of Michigan and Ching

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:02,150
hai University growing up in China have

18
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,298
been satisfied generally with the

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,400
internet speed and reliability we have

20
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:11,600
very much all the services you can find

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,630
in our domestic network for Google we

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:20,000
have I do for Facebook we have which

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:23,570
head but since I started to apply for

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,380
application for us grad schools

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,179
I noticed the speed is really slow

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,850
sometimes it was so slow than my

27
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:35,480
submission fails you occurred to me that

28
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:38,509
I rarely visit foreign website but there

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:42,820
are services that haven't had a Chinese

30
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:46,940
replica for example github overleaf and

31
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,880
the speed is also very slow this

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:53,360
observation made us wonder if this

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,640
phenomenon it is unique to China we

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,340
think this is a rather important

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,720
question because transnational network

36
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,090
performance is an indicator of economic

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,478
development infrastructure investment of

38
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,330
the countries and it allows the

39
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,540
information to flow around the world

40
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:18,739
we also want to know what we can do to

41
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:21,440
help improve the performance so our

42
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:24,680
measurement wants to look into traffic

43
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,319
flows around across national borders or

44
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,450
over the world

45
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:33,290
what is the throughput how often does

46
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:36,500
this slow speed happen if there is any

47
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:39,099
and we'll factor influence transnational

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,099
performance

49
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:47,238
here is our first measurement first

50
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:51,858
here's a map of our vantage points we

51
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:54,799
have 60 120 points in 29 countries and

52
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:58,639
regions that cover all six continents

53
00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:02,989
for each country we have to venture

54
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,590
points on average there are either call

55
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,219
server

56
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:10,329
red here or a residential host blue dots

57
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:14,060
here provided by volunteers

58
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:18,409
this figure shows our experiment setup

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:21,680
we host a HTTP server on every cloud

60
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:27,519
server and let them download file from

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:31,819
each other like this session a

62
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,579
residential hosts are always behind an

63
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:38,328
80 so they can only download file from

64
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:40,579
all the cloud servers we kept the speed

65
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:44,620
at Formica beats per second to avoid

66
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:50,540
wasting unnecessary network resources

67
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:53,150
here are the answers here this figure is

68
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:58,189
a box plot on the global transnational

69
00:03:53,150 --> 00:04:01,009
throughput here we call the one end of

70
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:05,358
one pair who sent the data center and

71
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:08,750
the other receiver for example China -

72
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:12,639
others means other are sending data to

73
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:16,039
China which is the downstream of China

74
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:20,000
for the rest of the talk we use a China

75
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:23,360
to refer specifically to mmmm China this

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,840
is the box plot so the size of the box

77
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,169
indicates the variance of the data in

78
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,888
our case the smaller the box the more

79
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:37,090
stable the throughput the horizontal

80
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:40,909
line indicates the median and the dot

81
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:44,900
indicates the mean as you can see the

82
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:49,060
box of the downstream and upstream of

83
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:53,929
African countries

84
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:57,280
and the down string of melon China is

85
00:04:53,930 --> 00:05:02,630
very large and their mean is only around

86
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:06,700
2.5 m/s good news is that the box of the

87
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:09,770
rest of the the world the country's is

88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,960
pretty small which means that their

89
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,590
traffic across national borders is

90
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,830
fairly stable so for most countries

91
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:23,210
their transnational network is pretty

92
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:26,120
good although both African countries and

93
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:29,150
China suffer from unstable throughput

94
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,060
their features are different every

95
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:35,539
country's experience slowed down on both

96
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,150
direction while China interestingly only

97
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:44,440
experienced it on one direction when

98
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:49,130
data was entry in China surprisingly

99
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:51,550
China's upstream is fast and stable like

100
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,550
the rest

101
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,440
another unique

102
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,690
of China's in transnational network

103
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:03,449
performance is that past a much clearer

104
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:07,020
diurnal pattern this three figures are

105
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:11,370
the so Dell other downstream throughput

106
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:15,568
of Nigeria and Egypt and China with the

107
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:19,500
same sender in the last figure we can

108
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:21,960
see surely after a a.m. local time every

109
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,610
day the throughput start to dip and

110
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:30,388
stays below 500 kilobyte kilobits per

111
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:35,099
second it can recover swiftly and night

112
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:37,050
between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. the

113
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:40,500
transnational network performance in

114
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,930
China is intriguing however so far our

115
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,229
measurements included only a small

116
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:49,530
number of vantage points in China we

117
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:51,330
were not sure if this observation is a

118
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:55,489
random incidence that we happen to

119
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:58,979
capture so this prompt us to perform

120
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:02,789
additional experiment to exam this

121
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:07,258
phenomenon so next measurement is about

122
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:10,020
China's in transnational Network we try

123
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:13,259
to answer these three questions I will

124
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,779
cover them one by one first question

125
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,300
would be how widespread is the

126
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,690
phenomenon throughout China is it

127
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,659
happening only in specific locations is

128
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:28,380
there happening only in specific time

129
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:32,389
does a similar slowdown occur for

130
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:38,880
domestic traffic does he apply to

131
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:41,539
real-life web servers to increase the

132
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:46,440
space coverage we include more than

133
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:51,360
twins in China 2:17 as you can see in

134
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:55,229
this map to cover to increase the time

135
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,630
coverage we repeated the test four times

136
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:01,229
with fairly long duration

137
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:04,650
this figure shows our end-to-end

138
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,540
experiments set up since we only observe

139
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,150
slowed down when the traffic goes into

140
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:13,960
China so we'll make all Vinci points

141
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:17,500
outside China ascenders and the one

142
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,930
inside China as receivers in all global

143
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,990
measurements domestic traffic was not

144
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:26,280
measured so we included here by making

145
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:30,220
the domestic VP of Crown servers as

146
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,789
senders to let them down let this and

147
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:40,570
let the receivers also download the file

148
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:43,479
from domestic senders to depict the

149
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,790
real-life usage scenario and also

150
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,430
eliminate the potential costs by

151
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:52,420
something wrong with our own HTTP

152
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:56,170
servers we pick the top 14 and blog

153
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:59,430
website all eight of them are foreign

154
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:04,079
and hosted outside of China and six are

155
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:08,800
domestic we find a sufficiently large

156
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,260
file on each web page and repeated

157
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,650
downloading the file all receivers

158
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:22,090
resolve the domain names of the websites

159
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:25,870
locally so the answer to this question

160
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:30,850
is a slowdown is prevalent in almost

161
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:34,300
every city so here's an average soda

162
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:37,540
hours per receiver aggregated over all

163
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:42,040
its corresponding senders as you can see

164
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:47,610
most receivers experience on average 5

165
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,610
to 17 hours of slow down per day

166
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:58,230
and the Sudan is prevalent on every

167
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:01,890
Sanders as well this is a this figure is

168
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,980
the average so dollars presenter or

169
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:09,980
suffered from four to eight hours on

170
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:13,590
daily on average day Hong Kong is an

171
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:18,750
outlier because he it has the least

172
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:21,330
throw down hours here is the CBF result

173
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:25,740
the average still down hours per day

174
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:28,530
across five tests the result is

175
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,450
consistent as you can see the lines are

176
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,990
really close to each other

177
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:40,350
roughly 70% of the pair's have a slow

178
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:43,740
down period of 5 hours or longer and the

179
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:46,950
result of top Alexa tests is consistent

180
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,050
with other tests the purple line here is

181
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:54,429
the top alexa test

182
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:56,769
and here is the aggregated number of

183
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:59,800
slow down hours experienced by all

184
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:03,249
receivers per website generally the

185
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:07,329
magnitude of slowdown is high and

186
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:11,589
comparable to them and to an experiment

187
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:15,128
the reason why I call experienced almost

188
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:18,519
no slowdown is because Apple has server

189
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:21,129
located inside China this figure also

190
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,129
demonstrates how important it is for

191
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:28,989
foreign foreign website to host their

192
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:33,489
server physically in China in contrast

193
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:37,239
there is no slowdown in domestic traffic

194
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:43,360
but domestic domains shows no slowdown

195
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:46,869
at home now we confirm the existence and

196
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,360
prevalence of the slowdown we want to

197
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:51,809
know more about it which maria bates

198
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,529
asked to the next question what adam

199
00:11:51,809 --> 00:12:00,910
performance characteristics so what

200
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:03,399
factors influence performance the first

201
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:07,449
feature is that the Soudan follows a

202
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:12,869
specific diurnal pattern for example in

203
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:12,868
Figure B list-building start early

204
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:21,449
in the morning from 6:00 a.m. lasting

205
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:25,740
all the way through 3:30 a.m. after

206
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:29,790
midnight lasting a total of more than 21

207
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,889
hours each day however not all so

208
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,260
they'll share this only one diurnal

209
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:36,720
patterns actually different location

210
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,230
errors might have different there are no

211
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,870
patents Beijing and Sweden might have

212
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:46,589
one patent Beijing in Japan may have

213
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:48,779
another pattern for example here figure

214
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:51,510
a has a different pattern

215
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:55,050
another thing that's worth noting is

216
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:57,449
that May 1st and May 2nd are the

217
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,870
national holidays in China and up to

218
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:04,589
October 1st is the national day and

219
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:06,510
China's 17th anniversary which means the

220
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,269
slowdown is not affected by the

221
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,930
important National Day or holiday or

222
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,930
weekend

223
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:19,820
in our last experiment we control both

224
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:22,220
end so we can captured the role packet

225
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:27,470
trace to get the loss rate and latency

226
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:31,340
when we expect the end to end last rate

227
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:34,760
from the role packet trace we find that

228
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:38,750
that most packet losses have occurred in

229
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:41,360
one direction only from foreign country

230
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,880
entering China this matches the

231
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,730
observation we had in the global test

232
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,790
where the through code is low only when

233
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:54,110
the data is sent from outside into China

234
00:13:49,790 --> 00:14:00,760
the average loss rate over an entire day

235
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:00,760
is typically in the range of 5% to 15%

236
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,790
from the engine test we observed high

237
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:12,050
correlation between low throughput

238
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:15,199
increased increased and planless rate

239
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:20,620
and increased latency as you can see

240
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:23,100
here which is generally in conformity in

241
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,420
conformity

242
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:30,000
with a normal congestion however this is

243
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,010
not to rule out the possibility that and

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,820
the congestion can be artificially

245
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:39,180
imposed for example by lowering the

246
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,870
bandwidth so we try to ascertain whether

247
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:45,989
the observed bottleneck is an artifact

248
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:50,400
of some traffic differentiation policies

249
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:54,240
for example is a base on particles is a

250
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,840
based on critical types of packet types

251
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:03,450
or speed we performed a number of AP

252
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:10,350
tests we found no noticeable differences

253
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:12,780
between all the AP tests our next

254
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,450
question is where is the bottleneck

255
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:18,569
before the hat I want to give you a bit

256
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:25,230
of background on China's unique network

257
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:28,620
topology a recent Oracle a recent report

258
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:31,320
from article Oracle clings China's

259
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:36,090
network is like an Internet

260
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:39,090
first of all China's disallow 4 ISPs to

261
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:42,960
operate within the country and only

262
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:45,930
recently lift the restriction also the

263
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:49,530
report claimed that China is connected

264
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:52,199
to the rest of the Internet primarily

265
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:54,750
through a limited number of connection

266
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,950
points which are always physically

267
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:01,530
low-tech located outside of melon chain

268
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:04,440
here is a figure from the report as you

269
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:06,720
can see all the connection points are

270
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,500
physically located outside of mainland

271
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:15,080
China and most traffic passes through

272
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,080
the United States and Western Europe

273
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:24,469
our result shows the bottleneck mostly

274
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:27,290
occurs within China

275
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,870
the detail of how we locate the

276
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,839
bottleneck can be found in our paper we

277
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:38,420
kept characterized the bottlenecks hops

278
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:40,790
into four groups we found that 71% of

279
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,959
the cases the bottleneck hubs are

280
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,980
located deep in China which is abnormal

281
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,330
because we know the domestic

282
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,740
infrastructure can handle the domestic

283
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:57,020
traffic pretty well however it fails to

284
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:00,590
handle the smaller transnational traffic

285
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:04,400
and it does not make any sense from the

286
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:07,400
economic perspective as it is much more

287
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,970
expensive to construct transnational

288
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:16,630
links such as submarine cables which are

289
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:20,420
interestingly of not the bottleneck here

290
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:26,230
so here is a summary of our current

291
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:29,200
findings the slowdown is surprisingly

292
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:33,640
prevalent in almost every country

293
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:39,020
happening every day and occurs to top

294
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:41,540
alexa website as well and the domestic

295
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:47,300
traffic surprisingly is very stable

296
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:51,050
doesn't suffer from slowdown at all the

297
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:55,129
packet the packet packet it's a blast

298
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:59,899
only from one direction going into China

299
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:04,540
and the slowdown follows some

300
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:07,820
interesting varied diurnal patterns and

301
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:12,590
no Egret will be found no irregular

302
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:16,100
traffic throttling policies and the

303
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,550
bottleneck almost always occur within

304
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,550
China

305
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:27,740
now we come to the third question where

306
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:31,370
where are the causes we come up with two

307
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:35,210
classes of hypothesis first the slowdown

308
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:38,090
can be due to some government regulation

309
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:42,740
for example sir being the published

310
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:44,770
purpose of censorship second the

311
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,700
slowdown can be due to financial

312
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:54,639
motivations of the Chinese eyes peace

313
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:59,540
attempting to make a profit off of it

314
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:02,620
Internet no peering as we covered

315
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:06,110
earlier there is no sign of traffic

316
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:08,689
differentiation based on poor coast even

317
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:12,219
the ones that can pipe bypass the

318
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:17,660
censorship as China is known for is

319
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:20,600
advanced censorship capabilities it is

320
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,480
natural to subset a suspect

321
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,490
this has something to do with a still

322
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:30,800
down especially when the slowdown

323
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:33,740
patterns are are so the only regular one

324
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,470
possible explanation is that GF data is

325
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:40,910
very sensitive in processing large

326
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:44,330
volumes of national traffic and can

327
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:47,720
become overwhelmed easily however Jeff

328
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:50,360
double operates as an oompa system which

329
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,050
only processes copies of existing

330
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:57,229
packets without the ability to discard

331
00:19:54,050 --> 00:20:00,530
everything packets in addition we

332
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:04,460
designed a small experiment to locate

333
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:09,379
the bots the hops with gfw presents

334
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:12,260
using TTL limited probes and then try to

335
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:16,310
match them with the bottleneck comps we

336
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:20,780
found only 34% of the cases it is

337
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:26,419
matching so it's not likely due to Jeff

338
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:27,370
tableau Creek Canyon Creek Canon on the

339
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,760
other hand

340
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:33,520
is indeed an empath system but we have

341
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,100
no evidence of it being we proposed

342
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:41,320
forward traffic thought boom

343
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:44,919
in fact as mentioned earlier this soda

344
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,980
correct is 66 a certain characteristics

345
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:54,000
from the previous measurements closely

346
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:57,700
it matches those in a natural congestion

347
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,650
according to a recent report by the

348
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:05,559
China Academy of information and

349
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:08,830
communication in technology China's

350
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:12,730
international submarine cable department

351
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:16,720
still falls behind the words other major

352
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:19,750
economies however this is unlikely to be

353
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,230
the primary cause because as we saw

354
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,670
earlier the bottleneck are most located

355
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,010
within China

356
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:33,760
not on the border a more plausible

357
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:36,790
reason is financial related in the early

358
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,580
years Chinese ice peace do not have a

359
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:43,270
good reputation of making international

360
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:46,149
peering easy because they wanted to grow

361
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:50,200
their own transit business and make

362
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:54,570
themselves to be top tier ISPs according

363
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:57,760
to China account a Academy of

364
00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:01,059
information and communication technology

365
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,240
report or other three state-owned ISPs

366
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:09,300
have set up a premium transnational

367
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:14,620
network for primarily for business uses

368
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:17,860
to maximize their profit for example

369
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:22,209
here is the screenshot from China

370
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:25,719
Telecom global official website they

371
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:32,980
offer four tiers of services to connect

372
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:39,309
to Chinese user so the the toughest one

373
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:43,600
even offer static route to verify the

374
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:47,799
the existence of tiered services we

375
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:51,040
found an exotic VPS provider resounding

376
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:54,820
these theorems serve networks through

377
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,909
hosting and they provide tests IPS that

378
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:01,720
allow customers to check their loss rate

379
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:04,570
and latency into these nodes from within

380
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:10,330
China we found the last rates does

381
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:13,500
decrease with the tier of network at the

382
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:17,439
end of the day we admit that this

383
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:22,750
analysis is largely a best-effort based

384
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:25,660
on our data and can be and we believe

385
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,880
pinpointing the root cause further would

386
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,940
require potential insider knowledge

387
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,540
about the government policy and I asked

388
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:41,679
peas in there working so here is a

389
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:45,629
takeaway of our our presentation so we

390
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:48,990
found the slowdown is prevalent

391
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:52,330
nationwide every day and this is

392
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:54,570
happening every day and apply to real

393
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,570
life

394
00:23:54,789 --> 00:24:04,989
sites however the domestic traffic is is

395
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:11,829
not affected at all and is very stable

396
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:14,619
and and the slowdown Falls some varied

397
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:17,649
diurnal Penton and the fall and the

398
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:22,089
packet loss is only happen in one

399
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:28,178
direction the bottlenecks are mostly

400
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:31,839
within China and as to the causes we

401
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:36,369
found it is not due to some irregular

402
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:38,440
traffic throttling and we haven't come

403
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:42,569
to a conclusion because you require

404
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:47,619
potential insider knowledge so our

405
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:50,229
future work is to look into more more

406
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:52,869
countries to study more countries such

407
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:55,899
as Russia and Iran because we believe

408
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:58,589
this is a long-term trend at a global

409
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:58,589
scale

410
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:06,159
thank you we hope our effort can help

411
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:09,729
administrators or policymakers to locate

412
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:13,890
the so down problem and eliminate the

413
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:13,890
bottleneck thank you that will be all

414
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,610
well thanks for listening everybody

415
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,039
unfortunately we have some technical

416
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,559
difficulties with our speaker and you

417
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,720
couldn't be on line for our questions

418
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:28,779
and answers but I'm sure if you asked on

419
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,009
the net on waiting list he can reach out

420
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,299
and answer to any questions you might

421
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:33,850
have

422
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:35,110
we're going to oh I just want to make a

423
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,509
quick announcement there's been some

424
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,039
discussion of having some zoom breakout

425
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:40,690
sessions on Wednesday as kind of

426
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,519
mini-boss so if that's the kind of thing

427
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,669
you're interested in mention it in the

428
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:48,009
comments or send email or something and

429
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,419
we'll see what we can do and this

430
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:51,159
concludes our current session and we'll

431
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:52,389
return it 3:30 Eastern with one of my

432
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,980
favorite tops of archives

433
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:55,860
Jeff Houston on desperately seeking

434
00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:03,589
default thanks
