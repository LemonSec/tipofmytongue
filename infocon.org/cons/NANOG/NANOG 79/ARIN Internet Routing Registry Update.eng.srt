2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,790
I would like to introduce our speaker

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:21,060
john curran he is president and CEO of

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:23,040
Aaron and today he will be giving an

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,270
Erin Internet routing registry in our

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,369
PKA update thank you very much Jeff I'm

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,220
John Curran president CEO of the

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,540
American registry for Internet numbers

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,510
Erin I'm here I'm going to talk about

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,720
what Erin is doing on its internet

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,050
routing registry project IRR and what

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,290
we're doing with our PKI as well let me

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,690
try to give you a quick update on what

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,589
we've been doing and how it affects you

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,480
with some pretty important changes so

16
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,910
Erin has been in the middle of doing a

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:03,000
major upgrade to our infrastructure we

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:06,350
did Erin online in 2019 and we started

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,509
our IR our new internet routing project

20
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,280
at about the same time we had done the

21
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:13,439
requirements document with the community

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,900
talking about whether you even wanted a

23
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,619
new Erin Internet routing registry and

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,020
the consensus was that you did so we did

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,810
a requirements document identify key

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,570
stakeholders and have been doing the

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,540
design we're now past design we're into

28
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,158
deployment and QA and our initial

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,799
deployment for our new internet routing

30
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,220
registry that's integrated with Erin

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,430
online will be June 10th so it's just

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,100
coming up next month initially there's

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,560
going to be two ways to create objects

34
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,119
in Erin's internet routing registry

35
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,840
using the existing email template

36
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,180
processor to create objects just as

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,250
people have been doing but we'll pick up

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,110
the new way of using Arin online a

39
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,470
web-based interface to create internet

40
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,470
routing objects now in the process of

41
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,530
updating Erin's IRR we had to do quite a

42
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:10,470
bit of work first the back end is was

43
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,379
quite a historic routing engine or a

44
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,730
routing registry engine we've updated to

45
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:19,529
a new platform we're using IRD 4 and

46
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,369
then we had to come up with processes

47
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:24,630
for migration of data and then how to

48
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,330
distinguish valid

49
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,700
data and to keep track of that within an

50
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,370
errand because we have a lot of data as

51
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,799
people know in the existing Arin IRR and

52
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,320
there was a call from the community to

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,660
be very careful and clearly distinguish

54
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,230
the data that was being created by

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,600
people we knew and people we could

56
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,670
validate versus data that was just being

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,019
carried over so we created an

58
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,760
architecture for that and we'll talk

59
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,740
more about how that gets published but

60
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,170
there's actually two data sets involved

61
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,030
here and then of course a front-end

62
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,869
interface to allow people to go and air

63
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:04,680
online and create new records for

64
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:06,480
internet routing registry objects so

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,340
what's going to happen is that all of

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,480
the existing objects and the NR and IRR

67
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,340
I get migrated into the new internet

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,250
routing engine internet routing registry

69
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,800
daemon all them get migrated and they

70
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,890
end up in two data sets one of them is

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,500
Erin which will be everything that's

72
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:29,459
validated is meeting our requirements so

73
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,370
we know who it is and if the resource is

74
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,320
associated with a normal organization

75
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,220
and it's it's got our own services

76
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,350
associated with it

77
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,680
that will end up being published in the

78
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:43,560
Arin data set and then for everything

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,340
else that's in the IRR those get moved

80
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:51,380
in to the new IRR and get published in

81
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:54,930
the Erin no off unvalidated object set

82
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,640
so a fairly simple approach you've seen

83
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,700
it before if you're familiar with other

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,079
routing registries and other are IRS and

85
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,060
we hope this makes it clear going

86
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,640
forward we expect to see more and more

87
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,250
valid objects in the Arin dataset and

88
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,708
over time the error and no offset will

89
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:16,649
become a Don auth will become less

90
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:19,350
important people will still be using the

91
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:22,799
old email processor and that includes

92
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,930
people who aren't known Daren or

93
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360
validated people who had an email

94
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:31,040
address and managed to use Aaron's old

95
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,060
IRR service each day we will migrate

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,230
newly created objects for our paid

97
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,140
objects

98
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:41,060
into the new database if it lines up

99
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:45,599
with a valid user ID a valid org ID

100
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:48,480
that's associated with the addresses in

101
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,980
Aaron then as long as we validate the

102
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,870
organization and there are current Aaron

103
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,750
online user then it will end up in the

104
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,370
Aaron data set if we've never validated

105
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,350
the user we don't know anything more

106
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,830
than what you know their email address

107
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:04,080
we don't know the organization or why

108
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,700
they're representing an object it may

109
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,580
not be assigned to them we may not even

110
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,909
know what organizations involved it ends

111
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,800
up in the non auth data set no new

112
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,590
maintainer x' will be accepted into the

113
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,800
irr email system to create an object you

114
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,960
need a maintainer object and you folks

115
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,570
who have them are fine but we will be

116
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,030
winding down over time the irr email

117
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,370
interface and so no new maintenance will

118
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,710
be accepted if you want to create new

119
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:36,990
objects where after you validate use

120
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,979
that aren't online to do so the objects

121
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,780
what objects are we going to support

122
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,310
we're not going to support the full RP

123
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,140
SL we're gonna support a reasonable

124
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:48,060
subset so that's route route six

125
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:54,060
autonomous system number a SM route set

126
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:56,010
and those are reflect 99% of the usage

127
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,440
out there so that shouldn't be a problem

128
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,750
when you create an object in our online

129
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,240
you only can maintain it and update it

130
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,880
in our online there's no access to that

131
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,870
object you can't switch between that and

132
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,690
email templates in fact if you're using

133
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,940
the email templates continue to use them

134
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,500
but once you go in and begin creating

135
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,140
objects in our online we're going to

136
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,610
disable your email template so you only

137
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,930
use our online to create the objects and

138
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,180
the reason for that is because there's

139
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,500
some interesting migration issues we

140
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,140
don't want to get into a situation of

141
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,480
how to reconcile objects that are

142
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,510
updated in email objects that are

143
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,210
updated in our online so the email we're

144
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,150
happy to provide a way to get that data

145
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,909
into Aaron online so you can have that

146
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,950
and have that published but we're not

147
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,920
going to provide ongoing back and forth

148
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,810
it's

149
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,750
intended to be a street that's from one

150
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,970
way when you go into Aaron online and

151
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,390
you say I want to start creating four

152
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,670
objects with the iron online web

153
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,640
interface it will say we're going to

154
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:06,730
disable your maintainer ID so you will

155
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:10,740
not be maintaining things using the old

156
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:13,870
email template system okay

157
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,130
so pathetic ated iron objects you've

158
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,830
been paying them with the old email

159
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,530
templates when you want to have a Fenna

160
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,479
gated irr objects you can continue to

161
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,119
use the old templates and not use our

162
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,700
online or you can start using Aaron

163
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,860
online and then that's what all than

164
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,940
anyone knew coming into the IRA will use

165
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:35,620
and you'll end up using that and all the

166
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,090
objects created via the Aaron online web

167
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,430
interface or posts are authenticated

168
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,560
just the party logging in using our

169
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,840
online we know they are we know what

170
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,100
organization they're associated we're

171
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,590
publishing all the data on the

172
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,650
fabricated and authenticated ira objects

173
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:55,840
will be publishing via ftp and we'll be

174
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:58,030
publishing them by n TR M so for neilton

175
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,359
for near real-time monitoring NT RM

176
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,400
feeds we ran off or two streams one for

177
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,790
the validated irr one for the

178
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,969
unvalidated if you're relying on Aaron

179
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:12,610
IRR data today you're using that for

180
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,400
your own route waiting what route

181
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,550
filtering you need to start pulling both

182
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,890
streams you'll need to configure that

183
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:24,640
after June 10th the serial numbers get

184
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:26,409
reset on the NR TM streams so after June

185
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,130
10th you'll need to update your

186
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:33,550
processor and start pulling new streams

187
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,900
both Aaron and Aaron on off if you don't

188
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,260
do that you're not going to need a tour

189
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,240
unless you use the new serial number

190
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,490
obviously FTP will have to FTP archives

191
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,470
for that data you'll be able to pull

192
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,260
down both you'll if you're using FTP to

193
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:51,430
pull irr data you'll need to update to

194
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,850
pull both Aaron nan off and Aaron

195
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,849
sources

196
00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:01,849
future IRR functionality so we've had

197
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:04,190
requests to have an API to manage IRR

198
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:07,040
records and we will do that where the

199
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,500
process of specking that out so that

200
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,740
people who want the new ir functionality

201
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,360
want to have some automation and but

202
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,090
don't want to end up using a male based

203
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,050
approach we'll have a tool that lets

204
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,060
them switch to using the new IRR and

205
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,150
still have some programmatic interface

206
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,000
working on API to that purpose we have a

207
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,520
team looking at other IR enhancements

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,810
and we're to continue to have them do

209
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,090
any other cleanup or any other

210
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,160
functionality that people want through

211
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,950
this year and potentially a little bit

212
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,490
beyond now as much as we love the

213
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,660
internet routing registry out there

214
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,960
there's a lot of big push to actually

215
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,520
have something that has even tighter

216
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,060
attributes in terms of useful

217
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,040
information and that is rpki and so I

218
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,400
want to spend a little bit of time our

219
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,660
work on IRR is not designed to displace

220
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,490
work on rpki

221
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,890
it's in fact intended to be

222
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,770
complementary but we're also doing quite

223
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:09,020
a bit of work Erin on rpki or in the

224
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:12,530
middle of a big rpki infrastructure

225
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:15,939
upgrade and to that end we have done

226
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:18,110
some changes already we are now doing

227
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,480
repository generation on a faster

228
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,820
schedule every five minutes so if you go

229
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,160
in and create new objects on our hosted

230
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,700
service you'll see our repository update

231
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,730
and a rapid time we've added our DP

232
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:36,200
request our piano repository Delta

233
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:37,670
protocol to allow more timely repository

234
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,510
retrieval than what our sync was

235
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:44,839
providing we've changed our row up the

236
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:47,300
validity period we had it set to many

237
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:51,130
many years we're now using a more

238
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:55,939
commonly used 825 days we're going to

239
00:10:51,130 --> 00:11:00,290
we've updated our rpki delegated support

240
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,600
to have full support for our fe80 2883

241
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,209
uptime protocol and we spent a little

242
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,160
bit of time testing that out with

243
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,470
different implementations there's now

244
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,870
some very good implementations for

245
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:15,380
delegated RPI service you can run your

246
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:18,080
own CA and link into Erin

247
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,530
end up with your records validated that

248
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,390
way

249
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:23,810
but at the same time have full control

250
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:25,580
over what gets published and we've added

251
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,250
the capability to list and delete row is

252
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,740
via our restful registration services

253
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:34,610
they have an API for that right now

254
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,320
using our restful web interfaces let's

255
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,150
see what we're going to be doing in the

256
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,940
backend we have some changes coming

257
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:45,680
we're going to be moving to a new HSM

258
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:48,230
our prior HSM was getting long in the

259
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,979
tooth and so we're moving to a new HSM

260
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:54,320
and with a more streamlined interface

261
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:57,680
between the HSM and the Internet online

262
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,320
application we're gonna be removing some

263
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,400
limitations we've had notations on the

264
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,400
number of CRO certificate revocation

265
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:10,010
lists and those will get cleaned up in

266
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,900
this process makes some other

267
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,840
operational aspects like key signing

268
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:18,050
ceremonies simpler and that's coming

269
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:20,120
later this year and we'll also be adding

270
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,290
better tools to make it easier to use

271
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,390
rpki some notification enhancements and

272
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,370
UI improvements and then the last one

273
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,870
was we're going to tying these together

274
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,410
to some extent we're gonna make it

275
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:37,190
pretty easy to synchronize on our and

276
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:39,500
our PGI data so that people who want to

277
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,730
provide the information that people no

278
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,680
matter what they're using whether

279
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:47,060
they're using run validation with RPI or

280
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,339
whether or not they're taking

281
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,989
informations or IRR

282
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,270
will make it easier for our hosted

283
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,770
customers to be able to put their

284
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:59,210
information and keep them in sync

285
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:02,360
both IRR in our PKI with that it

286
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:07,450
finishes my formal presentation and I

287
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,450
guess I'll now turn it back to questions

288
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:17,780
hi John oh hey how are you thank you

289
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:23,150
thank you for the update and thank you

290
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:26,120
for being here happy the next one we

291
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:29,120
have some questions for you I'm just

292
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,950
going to read them as a game the gaming

293
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:38,750
okay the first question is will our

294
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:41,600
invalidate against rpki internally so

295
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:46,040
right now is a sort of a gave an idea

296
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,920
we're doing the new IRR and getting that

297
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:53,300
in place we're looking at how to do AI

298
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:56,300
are our PKI integration later this year

299
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,640
right now our definition of validation

300
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,579
is as I said in the slides as long as

301
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:05,120
the organization as long as the routing

302
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:07,310
object is associated with a Nolen

303
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,150
organization that has services from Arin

304
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:14,780
it'll be considered valid and in the off

305
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:17,689
data set or the Arin regular streams

306
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,459
we're not doing in the immediate

307
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,830
validation against rpki

308
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,930
so that is something in the future we

309
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,220
don't know if will validate or provide

310
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,390
that as another opportunity to

311
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,920
automatically feed IRR objects from we

312
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,010
need to talk to the community about that

313
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,420
so initially no long term we do want to

314
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,800
do an integration but we want to talk to

315
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,800
community about how they want that done

316
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,689
thank you

317
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:47,870
the next question is are you moving to

318
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:49,760
IRR d4 um yes I think I might have

319
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,010
mentioned that real quick at the

320
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,160
beginning so the new routing engine is

321
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:57,380
based on IR d4 we'd like to thank Joe

322
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,290
and Sasha and the whole team working on

323
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,200
that it's a major step forward for Aaron

324
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:06,730
and just happy to have access to such

325
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,730
high quality open-source software

326
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:15,749
next question is I currently utilized

327
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:19,499
the rod b4 IRR I'm in the process of

328
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:21,629
setting up rpki with Aaron how painful

329
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:28,709
would it be to decommission their RB and

330
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:30,540
move to the are in IRR ah okay so um the

331
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,079
community had told us for many many

332
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,480
years

333
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:36,388
don't bother working on iron and that's

334
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,990
actually what we did we let it sort of

335
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:43,410
languish out there and about four years

336
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:46,889
ago people said hey your IRR has gotten

337
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:50,120
so far behind you need to update it so

338
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:53,639
we're offering a new IRR and certainly

339
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,370
you could decide to use Aaron's new IRR

340
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,110
if that's what you want to do a couple

341
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,939
of things to think about right now we

342
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,189
don't have a programmatic interface so

343
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:05,459
this is really useful for someone who

344
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:07,889
wants to go on web interface create a

345
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:10,319
few route objects that's suitable if

346
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:12,149
you're currently doing a template-based

347
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:15,209
update automatic updates for the

348
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:18,300
customers are similar then you probably

349
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:20,849
want to keep either using the old Aaron

350
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,040
template what based one or continue to

351
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,980
use our ADB for a while until we can

352
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,879
give you a an API in an interface in a

353
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,980
programmatic interface so if you're

354
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,230
starting from scratch well that's a

355
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,629
great question if you can maintain

356
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:40,649
things manually you might want to just

357
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:43,679
create I our objects with the new Aaron

358
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:46,860
IRR coming out on June 10th if you need

359
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,360
a programmatic interface they don't want

360
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,089
the way your project you probably want

361
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,170
to use something else and then look at

362
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:54,170
Aaron after we have one

363
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:01,699
thank you

364
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,730
lesson is do you in still intend to

365
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:06,709
allow other IRS access to authentication

366
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:12,439
of objects have you figured out how to

367
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:16,370
do this well okay so we do n rpm and FTP

368
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:21,140
access to both data sets Aaron and Aaron

369
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:23,329
on off so people can use either sets of

370
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,980
data they want but the only thing that's

371
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:28,610
going to show up in the Aaron

372
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,740
data set going forward is information we

373
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,939
can actually validate where we know the

374
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,539
organization we have a current

375
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:39,890
relationship with them there's a lot of

376
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:41,750
information in the old IRR that is

377
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,580
impossible to validate the

378
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:47,929
organization's have gone away the

379
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:52,189
maintainer --zz have gone away so we're

380
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:53,480
not providing other IRS access one way

381
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,630
or the other what we're doing is

382
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:01,159
creating a clean data source with the

383
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:03,980
Aaron stream which anyone can use in any

384
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:12,590
way they want I guess I missed that

385
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:13,940
question you better ask it just just to

386
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,720
make sure that I got it correctly as

387
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:20,090
well do you still intend to allow other

388
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,320
IRS access to authentication objects

389
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:27,740
have you figured out how to do this so

390
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,139
mix the next question if I proxy right

391
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:33,140
is there objects they for my customers

392
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,409
what happens to these objects if I use

393
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:40,490
the web interface can I continue to

394
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:45,169
proxy register for my customers the

395
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:52,640
whole idea of proxy registration is kind

396
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:54,320
of a oxymoron i we're moving to where

397
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,059
we're going to have validated data and

398
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:03,230
that means that already for example in

399
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,760
aaron you cannot do it a read allegation

400
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,039
to a customer without them creating

401
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,860
their own object so i'd recommend you

402
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,879
not

403
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,889
try to build a model based on proxy

404
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:20,429
systems if you are you might want to use

405
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:23,670
another set of tools thank you the next

406
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:26,700
one is in rpki question why did you

407
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:29,490
select a 5-minute repository update do

408
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:34,410
you have any data on a periodicity of

409
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:36,330
client polling intervals hmm don't have

410
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,910
any data on that it's an excellent

411
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,250
question I'm going to need to dig a

412
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,320
little bit for that is that mr. key

413
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,500
that's probably mr. Houston

414
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,020
so let me Jeff I'll I'll dig that up and

415
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,900
get back and look the 5-minute if

416
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,549
there's a rational basis for it I'll let

417
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:59,190
you know and if that's not if you ever

418
00:19:53,549 --> 00:20:03,450
suggested one send it to me indeed it

419
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:06,900
was from mr. Houston okay next question

420
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:09,299
on the Flag Day Erin will be reset and

421
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,700
have they authenticated also known as

422
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:16,230
web submitted objects is Erin know not

423
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,650
starting with the current Erin content

424
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:22,470
or also from scratch excellent question

425
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,240
actually to be honest this is the most

426
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,850
complicated part of the migration so

427
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,010
because the first two times I looked at

428
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,969
this I wasn't quite clear I understood

429
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:37,440
it every day we will take what's in the

430
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:39,929
old I our database and move it into the

431
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,530
new publication points which are being

432
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:47,730
done under IRD for when we move it

433
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:50,520
everything that matches a and

434
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,260
authenticated Erin organization ends up

435
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,168
in the Erin stream and everything that

436
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,870
matches that doesn't ends up otherwise

437
00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:00,770
in the Erin dawn off the sum of those

438
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:03,928
two is the full set of information so

439
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:07,410
every day whatever it in the old

440
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:11,390
template based email based IRR is going

441
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:15,570
to end up in Erin on off being published

442
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:17,460
the set of that that's validated by Erin

443
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:20,220
where we have a valid organization ID

444
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,890
ends up in the arrow on the string so

445
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,510
it's some

446
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,950
the answer the question the short one is

447
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,350
it's not from scratch it's fully

448
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,419
populated - those things that are

449
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,870
authenticated and those are only in the

450
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:39,020
Aaron stream not the Aaron long and

451
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:43,789
every day that updates thank you the

452
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:45,799
next question is is there day one bulk

453
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:49,480
import function functionality in

454
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:52,668
web-based irr or is that pending the API

455
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,730
no bulk load right now we're gonna have

456
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:58,370
to figure out how to create an API that

457
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:01,309
makes sense for that and there's no

458
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,809
standard for this folks so I am

459
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:05,120
interested in ideas if you have a

460
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:07,700
suggestion parents and schefren process

461
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,739
or the iron consult mailing list we

462
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,240
would be happy to take your input as to

463
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,520
what you need for API functionality

464
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:20,240
other than the obvious that you've been

465
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:22,789
doing templates right now two more

466
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,830
questions so one before the last what

467
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:27,770
does the timeline for Aaron look like

468
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:30,139
for some of those of those new arctic ki

469
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,908
enhancements for example the

470
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,490
notification to take and routing

471
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:37,220
contacts for automatic are away even new

472
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:40,400
ones it's a priority for this year to

473
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,929
get done by the end of 2020 I don't hear

474
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:49,010
screams on the background so I think I

475
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:53,690
got that right and we have so far and we

476
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:57,049
still have seven minutes is an LRS a

477
00:22:53,690 --> 00:23:00,130
required for access to this new IRR

478
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:02,539
service now that excellent question so

479
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:06,110
the only things that end up in the Aaron

480
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:07,820
stream is authenticated objects and that

481
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,889
means we actually know the organization

482
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,889
we have an agreement with them there's a

483
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:15,289
lot of old data we don't actually know

484
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,539
who put it in or whether the party that

485
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:20,270
put it in for the old objects the old

486
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:22,129
legacy blocks for example whether or not

487
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:25,158
that parties still own associated with

488
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,970
it so yeah if you want to have us say we

489
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,700
know who you are

490
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:32,149
and put you in the authenticated service

491
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,179
then yes you're going to have to end up

492
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:36,849
becoming a customer and

493
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:39,279
that's been consistent with Aaron's

494
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:41,319
approach people are legacy resource
