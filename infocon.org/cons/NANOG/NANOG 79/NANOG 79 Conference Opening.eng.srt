years to host our 2020 Spring Meeting in

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,530
March it became clear that the spread of

16
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,480
kovat 19 required nanak to take a number

17
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:45,650
of actions to protect our community our

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,540

actually one thing that I didn't want to

104
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,820
start off with is I wanted to test out

105
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:48,110
the polling system here so we can start

106
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,580
that poll a little fun because I'm sure

107
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,940
most people have not seen me like this

108
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,320
but should I shave this off but let's

109
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,860
see we'll keep the poll open for a

110
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,290
couple minutes as we start this program
