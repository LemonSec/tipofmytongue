thanks Chris howdy everybody I'm going

21
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:02,530
to try to be fairly interactive today

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,660
I've got some slides but they're mostly

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,060
just there to kind of give you a

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,009
reference in case you want to dig

25
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,560
further into any of the history of this

26
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:16,450
or you know look at links ever so please

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,450
feel free to submit questions any time

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,710
during the session and if it's about

29
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,830
what I'm talking about right then I'll

30
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:26,559
try and work in the answer and otherwise

31
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,650
we'll you know aggregate them up and hit

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:35,140
them at the end but I would you know do

33
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:37,390
as much Q&A as possible so you may

34
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,690
remember that there was a lot in the

35
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:44,950
news from sort of last November into

36
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:51,100
hold until we had a pandemic about org

37
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:52,810
and org being subject to an attempted

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,669
hostile takeover by a private equity

39
00:01:52,810 --> 00:02:01,120
firm and so what I'm gonna do is talk a

40
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:03,100
little bit about history of gorg and why

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,290
it's particularly interesting relative

42
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:09,728
to the 2000 other top-level domains out

43
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:15,610
there it is the third largest of the

44
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:18,700
gTLDs at 11 million registrants so it's

45
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,620
it's a big and significant domain just

46
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,980
from numbers perspective it's also one

47
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,640
of the

48
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,869
original generic top-level domains which

49
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,119
means it's been around for a long time

50
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:34,209
and it's sort of very in mesh what makes

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,120
the internet the Internet and it's also

52
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:41,319
interesting that you know a lot of

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,120
people think of you know org as being oh

54
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,980
you know a bunch of little you know

55
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,769
do-gooders you know off in the corner

56
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,599
somewhere but it's the United Nations

57
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,720
it's the World Bank

58
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:56,959
it's the IATA right like international

59
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,030
air traffic control is coordinated over

60
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,549
org domains

61
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,299
it's the Red Cross and Doctors Without

62
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:07,010
Borders and you know thousands and

63
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:10,940
thousands of other really large

64
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:13,220
significant nonprofits it's also you

65
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,989
know your kids weekend Football League

66
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,170
it's you know the church on the corner

67
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,590
it's you know the neighborhood social

68
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,670
club

69
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,920
so it's pervasive in a way that I think

70
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:28,000
people don't often think about and they

71
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,130
don't realize just how many

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,549
organizations are dependent on or before

73
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,350
their online identity so with all that

74
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:40,100
I'm going to try and give you a little

75
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:43,430
bit of background about co.org got to

76
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:48,170
where it was how it fell off a cliff

77
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:50,810
and how we sort of grabbed it as it went

78
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:54,440
over and are hanging on to it by the

79
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,060
back of its pants or whatever and and

80
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:00,230
what next steps would look like to

81
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:04,340
actually get it back on solid ground so

82
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:08,149
that org is was originally defined in

83
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:12,400
RFC 920 that was back in October of 1984

84
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:18,019
along with the other the other big ones

85
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:24,160
ComNet gov ed you mil and our PO with

86
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:24,160
Ian a during that it was

87
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:32,830
I'm sorry I'm gonna have notes here that

88
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:36,560
I can't quite see love that there we go

89
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,440
so the idea was that it was going to be

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,570
sort of entrusted to someone to operate

91
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,850
but it wasn't gonna be their property

92
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:53,030
right operating it was a responsibility

93
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:58,610
not a prize and at that time all of

94
00:04:53,030 --> 00:05:01,070
those top-level domains were the NIC the

95
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,650
DARPA Network Information Center was was

96
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,409
sort of handling the registry for all of

97
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,710
them and the DNS for all of them and so

98
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:13,370
forth and so then we've got a ten year

99
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,590
period we're not much dangers there are

100
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,810
very few people on the internet most of

101
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:22,039
those are at universities you know

102
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,449
everybody is just waiting for OSI to

103
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,400
come and kick the crap out of the

104
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:29,389
internet because you know the Internet

105
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,830
is just a bunch of academics and then

106
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:36,500
you know it starts to become clear that

107
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,300
it's going to be something big and it is

108
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,460
growing we have the anion of the

109
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,470
national information infrastructure plan

110
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:50,150
that privatizes the operation and the

111
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:53,120
internet and by 1994 it becomes apparent

112
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,448
that you know a restructuring of some

113
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,979
sort is gonna be needed and people are

114
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,110
very excited about the commercial

115
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:03,169
prospects of the Internet at this point

116
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,270
so a lot of people are really thinking

117
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,789
calm this is going to be everything

118
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,469
right so a lot of worry at this point is

119
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:12,259
that everything is going to registering

120
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,419
calm none of the other top-level domains

121
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:17,229
are going to get used and they're gonna

122
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:24,520
have to find a way of subdividing calm

123
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:27,080
so you go from org being the home for

124
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,560
organizations and nonprofits and

125
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:34,250
non-governmental stuff to miscellaneous

126
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,360
pov some non-government organizations

127
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,900
may fit here right it

128
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,699
the there's no change being described

129
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,469
but you know there's sort of an

130
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:54,240
offhanded this to the way it's it's a

131
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:59,520
sign its uses aside the important thing

132
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:05,280
in the 1994 RFC 1591 is that the role of

133
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:08,039
the registry is is really much more

134
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,909
clearly defined right we go from a

135
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,009
situation where there is sort of there's

136
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:16,710
only one and it's assumed that

137
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:19,949
eventually there will be more to a

138
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,229
situation where that you know more is

139
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,060
almost imminent right like everybody

140
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:27,659
recognizes that everything's exploding

141
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:32,400
and it's not just gonna be the internet

142
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:36,688
doing it all so we see this phrase that

143
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,090
that the registry is a trustee of the

144
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:42,360
domain and they have a duty to serve the

145
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,849
Internet community and then there's this

146
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,190
really specific language saying rights

147
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:49,370
and ownership or inappropriate ways of

148
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:53,370
thinking about it and you know

149
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,419
responsibility is what you need to think

150
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,509
about right that this is a

151
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,940
responsibility to the Internet community

152
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,310
it's not something that you own it's not

153
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:10,250
something that you can drive a private

154
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:14,960
benefit from so you know that said we go

155
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:17,969
for a few more years another eight years

156
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,818
with the transition from the Internet to

157
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:23,460
network solutions and network solutions

158
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:29,909
is of course you know a for-profit

159
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:36,120
company and sorry I just sort of flipped

160
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:38,429
through the slides here about the how

161
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,010
its to be governed the other interesting

162
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:46,010
point here is that it's pretty clear in

163
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:48,839
RFC 1591 that changes in who the

164
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,450
registry is Dell

165
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,880
what regice

166
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:57,100
is chosen operate org or to be made or

167
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,560
at least significantly made by

168
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,850
registrants by the nonprofit community

169
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,369
not as a business interest not by IKEA

170
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,840
arbitrarily well sorry it's not like any

171
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:13,660
other in 94 I can suppose up in 98 but

172
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,240
there there needs to be a registrant

173
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:21,310
driven selection process that's made

174
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:26,500
really clear in in that RFC so then

175
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:30,040
September 98 Hokkien is formed to take

176
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:34,210
over the sort of domain name industry

177
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:38,949
governance role be a homie for the IMO

178
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:41,910
going forward and multistakeholderism is

179
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,720
cited as the mechanism by which

180
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,480
governance decisions are going to be

181
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,060
made and there's a lot of talk about

182
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,070
bottom-up decision making and about the

183
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,069
community doing the decision-making and

184
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:58,330
that that is really the foundation on

185
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:01,240
which capture is going to be prevented

186
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,010
right that the community is in charge

187
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,990
the community is not going to let

188
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:13,900
somebody come along and capture its

189
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:18,880
resources then we get to July of 2002

190
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:23,140
and a deal is struck whereby no

191
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:27,520
exclusions will keep the common net

192
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:30,670
domains if they give up org they're sort

193
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,670
of given the choice of what to propose

194
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,860
to do and org is the smallest of the

195
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,540
three the least revenue of the three so

196
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,100
that's the one that they say they're

197
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,939
going to give up and it makes sense

198
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,100
right because it's for nonprofits you

199
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,680
know they already don't have at you at

200
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,470
that point which is the other sort of

201
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,109
very specific one of these because net

202
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,940
by this point by 2002 people are already

203
00:10:53,110 --> 00:11:00,340
registering all kinds of drunken net it

204
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:04,350
was no longer just accepting Internet

205
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:08,890
infrastructure the way it was defined

206
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:11,860
so the URL that's at the top of your

207
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,550
screen right now is a really really

208
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:18,490
interesting read because this is the

209
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:20,769
outcome of the selection process and it

210
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:27,100
tells you about how the selection

211
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:29,500
process was run ie I struggle to find a

212
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:34,630
useful analogy that helps people outside

213
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:37,329
the internet governance community really

214
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,750
get what this is like but the best I've

215
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:42,880
come across is best I've thought of it

216
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,610
in a lot of countries that don't have

217
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,800
their own space program it's really

218
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,810
prestigious to be the astronaut from

219
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,430
that country or the first astronaut from

220
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,229
that country and so there's this

221
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,779
selection process that happens in a lot

222
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,410
of countries to pick the first astronaut

223
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:01,630
for the country and so there's their

224
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,269
criteria that get established a lot of

225
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,189
criteria there must be reasonably

226
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:08,470
athletic must be able to hang upside

227
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,430
down must not throw up in weightless

228
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:14,920
whatever must have first-aid training

229
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,899
you know stuff like that there's you

230
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,649
know the sort of academic criteria right

231
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:22,899
must have a physics doctorate it must be

232
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:24,670
willing to do press events must be

233
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,440
willing to go to great schools and talk

234
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:33,219
to kids and make them excited about it

235
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:35,740
right and so then you get a sort of

236
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,110
first path of looking for volunteers

237
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,329
making sure that they sort of meet the

238
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,430
basic criteria and then you've got a

239
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:46,540
beauty pageant right you've got a sort

240
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:49,120
of a contest between all the candidates

241
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,339
that meet the basic criteria to figure

242
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,949
out which one is actually best not just

243
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,470
meeting the basic criteria but actually

244
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:59,199
the best of the bunch and that's really

245
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,680
what the process looked like in 2002

246
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:06,399
there was a multi-stakeholder process to

247
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:09,229
develop the criteria by which the new

248
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,200
registry would be selected

249
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,060
and a lot of criteria were put forward

250
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,160
some were dropped

251
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,859
you know the multi-stakeholder process

252
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,600
did its thing and eventually we got to a

253
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:26,710
set of criteria and then an RFP was

254
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,410
issued and eleven proposals came in and

255
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:32,150
then the multi-stakeholder community

256
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,150
went out and evaluated the eleven

257
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,770
proposals against the criteria that had

258
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,290
been established and they assigned

259
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:43,939
points and the points were weighted and

260
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:51,020
then you know we saw who got the most

261
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:55,880
points so we've got these these sort of

262
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:59,689
major criteria and the first of these

263
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,780
with differentiation and I'm not gonna

264
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:05,150
like read all this to you but the upshot

265
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,339
of this was they came up with this table

266
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,209
of you know points assigned to different

267
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,800
parts of differentiation and you know

268
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,380
added up and so forth and there was this

269
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:22,390
really clear winner called unity which

270
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:26,060
was a joint effort by a Association of

271
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:28,610
nonprofit cooperatives and Austrade

272
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:34,369
history the dot au registry was

273
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:38,450
providing the technical back in and you

274
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:41,180
see you know NuStar at number well tied

275
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,790
for number three with is C and that's

276
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,060
this consortium then you're gonna

277
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:51,130
software consortium and Internet Society

278
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:53,030
at five and you know a bunch of other

279
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,230
ones that were sort of thrown together

280
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,480
and more of a hurry

281
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,750
further down then there was

282
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,470
responsiveness this is sort of looking

283
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:07,310
at how well the organization was

284
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:10,310
proposing to communicate with nonprofits

285
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,219
about their needs with registrants you

286
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,839
know see what they wanted and do it

287
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,300
again

288
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:20,540
big table lots of argument points a sign

289
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,880
so forth and again unity comes out as

290
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:28,380
the the highest one

291
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:31,080
and then there was support which is how

292
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,810
many people in organizations wrote in

293
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,339
saying yes we're a non-profit and we

294
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:40,319
think this is the one that should be

295
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:42,060
selected and so they they had to kind of

296
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,070
do this one a little bit more on fly -

297
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:49,859
you know once they got all the letters

298
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:53,070
of support to say what how they would be

299
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:56,010
sorted out and so what they came to was

300
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:59,070
this you know Class A versus Class B

301
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:01,080
endorsements and Class A were weighted

302
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:05,240
five times as high as Class B Class B

303
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:09,690
was sort of you know just random folks

304
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:12,899
or you know interested parties Class A

305
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:17,850
was actual nonprofit organizations that

306
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:23,880
were dot-org registrants and so then

307
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:25,740
again they did this this ranking is C

308
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,980
was really well known obviously

309
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,520
publishers of mine Paul vixie is

310
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:36,300
organization at the time and they were

311
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,490
really well-liked they got no nonprofits

312
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:43,670
supporting them that 420 individuals

313
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:50,790
supporting and unity came out number two

314
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:53,219
and I saw came out number three because

315
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,199
they got all the I saw chapters to write

316
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,209
in individually and so all those got

317
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:03,870
demoted from A to B because they were

318
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:06,149
interested parties and so then you know

319
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,859
there's and in this document there's a

320
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,199
lot of discussion of all of this right

321
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:14,698
it's it's fascinating reading I'm not

322
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,230
gonna try and summarize at all so the

323
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,630
question then is how did we wind up with

324
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:22,439
I saw instead of unity right how was it

325
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,829
that they picked one from the middle of

326
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,030
the pack rather than the points leader

327
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:31,020
the answer is that there were 17 people

328
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:32,940
on the ICANN board and 7 of those were

329
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,010
also I

330
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,160
leadership and they didn't recuse

331
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:41,010
themselves and those seven included both

332
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,330
the chair and vice-chair of ICANN at the

333
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:47,190
time so you know one hopes that if this

334
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,770
process is run again or when this

335
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:53,280
process is run again and we have a

336
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,410
selection that the good

337
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,270
multistakeholderism will happen again

338
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:01,080
right that the multi-stakeholder process

339
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:03,600
will be followed but that I can will be

340
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,500
a lot more cognizant of conflicts of

341
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:11,429
interest and a lot more aware of you

342
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:14,070
know who the can be the stakeholder

343
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:16,410
community is versus you know I Cannes

344
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:22,950
role as a facilitator of the process not

345
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:24,800
as sort of the final arbiter so it took

346
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:34,040
a couple years to actually get things

347
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:38,040
switched over from milk solution - I saw

348
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:40,530
created a subsidiary PIR PIR outsource

349
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,909
to a filius affiliates outsource to new

350
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:48,060
star new store outsource - PCH kind of

351
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,740
deep chain there so it took a couple of

352
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,129
years to actually get that to the point

353
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,190
where it was working and then things

354
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:59,340
basically ran relatively unchanged for

355
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:03,750
quite a while now if you poke around in

356
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:06,600
the press from sort of December January

357
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:09,900
time frame there was a bunch of analysis

358
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,540
of the public financial documents around

359
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,150
org number of registrants and you know

360
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:17,970
how much was being charged and where

361
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:20,220
that money was going because the the

362
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,460
publicly stated rationale for giving

363
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,710
this to I sock rather than to unity was

364
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,620
that unity was just gonna operate it for

365
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:32,370
nonprofits but I saw was going to take

366
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:38,489
the profits and use them to fund the

367
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:42,719
IETF and so at first that was in fact a

368
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:45,789
significant portion of the revenue but

369
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:50,109
over time it's become a

370
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:52,840
a small portion and and the press did a

371
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:54,340
fair amount of analysis of that that if

372
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,389
you're interested you can go being into

373
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:02,499
that operational costs you know climbed

374
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:05,649
over time as the number of domains grew

375
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:07,570
but honestly it's not so much about the

376
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:09,699
number of domains it's much more about

377
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,009
how many people are trying to reach out

378
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,229
or domains which is proportional to the

379
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:17,289
number of Internet users and even more

380
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:20,440
how much people are trying to attack org

381
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:24,129
domain Speedos is what you have to build

382
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,259
for not actual DNS queries if we're just

383
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:28,478
actual DNS queries all this stuff would

384
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:31,239
be trivial right the number of actual

385
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:33,369
queries associated with these things are

386
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:36,549
you know Bo in the tens of thousands a

387
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:40,809
second but you have to be able to to

388
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:42,759
withstand tens of millions a second in

389
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:46,799
order to keep everything working during

390
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:49,929
the DDoS so so all that went along and

391
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:54,789
during this time during this in a better

392
00:20:49,929 --> 00:21:01,259
part of 20 years I can went through a

393
00:20:54,789 --> 00:21:01,259
whole bunch of CEOs and a whole bunch of

394
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:13,389
turnover in the board and I'll be really

395
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,460
blunt they got really really captured by

396
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:19,418
the domain name industry during this

397
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:22,509
time so I can went from being something

398
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:24,729
that everyone clearly understood to be a

399
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:26,830
regulator in the public interest to

400
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:32,609
something that looks a lot more like a

401
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:32,609
club of registry service providers and

402
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:42,729
so funny Hadi was the CEO for a while he

403
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:50,070
was the second to last CEO second to

404
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:53,529
current and he spearheaded an effort to

405
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:57,609
along with with ICANN's legal department

406
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:58,299
to make all domains uniform to treat

407
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,460
every domain

408
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:03,860
exactly the same

409
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:06,809
away from a contractual perspective and

410
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,178
this is really problematic right because

411
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:11,428
if there's not really a point in having

412
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,590
multiple domains if they're all going to

413
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:18,510
be treated exactly the same if somebody

414
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:20,250
in dot CA is actually in Mozambique you

415
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,850
know dot CA doesn't mean Canada anymore

416
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,340
if somebody in org is actually selling

417
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,850
tires it doesn't really mean nonprofit

418
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:32,010
anymore

419
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:36,539
so that was stripped out the price caps

420
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:38,549
that had been in place since the outset

421
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:41,779
of the sort of commercialization of the

422
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:54,299
internet those got stripped out but also

423
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:57,600
the sorry cover that anyway July 29th

424
00:22:54,299 --> 00:23:01,139
July last year the price gaps get pulled

425
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,969
off body is already gone at that point

426
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,529
he is exited through the revolving door

427
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:11,090
and a day later after the price caps are

428
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:14,010
pulled he registers the ethos capital

429
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:18,270
domain and of course nobody was really

430
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:22,169
looking so nobody knows who cares right

431
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:27,389
at that point but there'd been this sort

432
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:29,549
of loan slow bidding war of private

433
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,700
interests approaching my sock and saying

434
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:35,549
hey that thing that you guys don't

435
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,080
really know what to do with you know I

436
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,029
get that you're making a lot of money on

437
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,799
but we could give you a big chunk right

438
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:47,250
now and I saw you know sort of slowly

439
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:49,860
entertaining these over time and not

440
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:54,120
discouraging them but also not quite

441
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:55,830
biting but then the the price gap being

442
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,658
lifted that was the signal that sort of

443
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:01,980
sent all of those bidders into a frenzy

444
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:04,799
and so the offers went from being in the

445
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:08,929
sort of 300 million range - it turns out

446
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:12,360
1.1 billion which is interesting because

447
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:17,070
before the

448
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:22,889
Wow sorry before the price was announced

449
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:25,649
what what the winning bid had been a lot

450
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:28,559
of people looked at this and you know

451
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:30,719
did the math and said well you know this

452
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,309
should be somewhere between three and

453
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,019
four hundred million dollars right

454
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:37,230
that's a rational price and

455
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:39,750
interestingly the banks that financed

456
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:42,659
the private equity companies that they

457
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:46,190
gave them the low-interest comparatively

458
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:49,139
low interest loans to make this happen

459
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,880
they also came to the same conclusion

460
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:52,709
they weren't willing with a fully

461
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,820
collateralized loan too long more than

462
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:58,200
three hundred and sixty million and

463
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,820
Elizabeth Warren's Financial Analysts

464
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,860
came to the same number somewhere in the

465
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:06,299
high threes I ran the numbers and came

466
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:08,340
to 405 so that's what it was worth if

467
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:10,168
you weren't in a strip mall if you were

468
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,269
going to try and operate it responsibly

469
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:16,350
if you're gonna pay the operational

470
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:21,660
costs without degrading anything and you

471
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:23,000
know not start selling personal data so

472
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,500
[Music]

473
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,289
there are tens of thousands of folks

474
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,940
wrote in one of the things that we

475
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:31,620
figured out this really interesting and

476
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,710
this is this is sort of a hack that

477
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:37,379
anybody can do I Can Has the

478
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:40,169
correspondents web page and people watch

479
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,690
that and any letter that you send to I

480
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:44,159
can or any email if you say you want it

481
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:48,139
published on the correspondents web page

482
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:51,809
it goes on there and people see it and

483
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:53,959
previously nobody really used that very

484
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:55,769
much there was very little

485
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,039
correspondents other than sort of

486
00:25:55,769 --> 00:26:03,210
technical rigmarole between the

487
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:06,210
regulated entities and I can but you

488
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,880
know a whole lot of big nonprofits

489
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:10,769
rhodium and governmental and

490
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,500
intergovernmental organizations that

491
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:15,480
were named org and eventually the

492
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,590
California State Attorney General writes

493
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:23,370
in and says hey I can remember the

494
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:25,280
reason why you are an artificial legal

495
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,830
person in California

496
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,980
nonprofit is to operate in the public

497
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:35,780
interest and you're not doing that so

498
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:38,480
wake up but this conversation just keeps

499
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,850
going on and on I can keep sort of going

500
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,410
back and forth with ethos hoping that

501
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,750
somehow and add their gonna turn into

502
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,470
something good that of course doesn't

503
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,380
happen

504
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:53,210
the California AG has to write a second

505
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:57,140
time and then the ICANN board funded and

506
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:59,450
said well we're not gonna say yes to a

507
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:03,170
deal that Fadi put together because that

508
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:05,270
would be insider self-dealing revolving

509
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,940
door or horrible corruption bah-bah-bah

510
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,850
but you're welcome to come back with

511
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:17,600
bitter so that's where we are right now

512
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:19,520
the the problem is sort of on hold you

513
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,129
know the other bidders whoever the

514
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,990
second bidder was is some probably

515
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:27,770
having very interesting conversations

516
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:30,350
with Andrew Sullivan you know everybody

517
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:33,980
else is presumably trying to figure out

518
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:36,110
whether they can up their bid and I sock

519
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,940
is undoubtedly and obviously I can't

520
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:41,209
speak for I sock but trying to figure

521
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,280
out you know how long do they cool they

522
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,260
their heels before they say bringing

523
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,470
like sign back because they're board

524
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:50,780
voted for this unanimously and they've

525
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,460
said in a lot of public statements that

526
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,790
you know there's no way that they would

527
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,810
turn down a billion dollar offer and you

528
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,030
know when you get into a bidding war

529
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,620
like this people don't up their bids by

530
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,570
a hundred million dollars at a time

531
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,610
right which means that second and third

532
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:13,399
bidders are undoubtedly also well over a

533
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:13,870
billion yeah what do you guys have so I

534
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,810
just

535
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:19,790
is there anything to do towards reducing

536
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:22,399
the influence of big domain registrar

537
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:24,590
money in the system yeah well I think

538
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,720
the big one there is just what the

539
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,220
California AG said you know this is

540
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,130
supposed to be operating in the public

541
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,420
interest if you can't show that you're

542
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,900
operating in the public interest the

543
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,860
remedy there is it's not a legal person

544
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,580
anymore

545
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,529
and its assets get handed

546
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,490
off to something else now that's a hell

547
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:46,200
of a big stick and there would be a lot

548
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,990
of people who would be hugely pissed off

549
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,490
at the US government not really

550
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,350
understanding the difference between

551
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,340
federal and state and public bomb right

552
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,399
because the whole rest of the world

553
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,070
depends on like yeah

554
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:02,639
Portia Keenan have to cut off the feed

555
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:05,730
