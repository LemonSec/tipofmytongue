00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,360
[Music]

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,659

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,659
[Music]

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,760
we're now going to hear first-hand

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,490
accounts of the effects of kovat 19 on

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,850
networks from 3d experts representing a

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,830
CDN a cloud provider and an ISP this

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,020
panel will be moderated by Samuel Berg

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,479
an Emmy award-winning business and

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,529
technology journalist who is anchored

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,920
reported and produce at CNN ABC and NPR

13
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,140
Sam Michael thank you very much for that

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,000
introduction I'm really happy to be here

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,340
and by here I don't actually mean my

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,620
home in London but here with three of

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,930
the biggest names in the tech world in

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,780
this field starting number one with Dave

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,840
Temkin the vice president of network and

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,140
systems infrastructure at Netflix also

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,719
Rob racquel vice president for network

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,239
engineering at Comcast hey Rob and

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,300
Graham Kinsey manager of edge network

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,709
capacity and operations at Google the

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,240
first two I mentioned you guys are on

26
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,490
the East Coast of the United States

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,710
Graham you're there in Zurich so we've

28
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,810
got people covering a couple of

29
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,880
continents here let's jump right into it

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,070
because I want to know what those first

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,110
days were like take us back to that

32
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,479
first quarter of the year when you

33
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,640
realize that something unprecedented was

34
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,070
happening and how you responded what the

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,689
war rooms were like from your home to

36
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,570
your colleagues home Dave I'd love to

37
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,429
start with you and hear what you thought

38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,548
was happening and how you had to react

39
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,430
in those initial days or so I think like

40
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,310
any other unprecedented disaster you

41
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,140
think back to things like 9/11 or the

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,960
2003 bat blackout and things like that

43
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,070
you try to figure out what is the scope

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,630
of this and I think we all kind of

45
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,820
started from a place of okay this is

46
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,000
relatively small it's contained not

47
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,229
gonna be that big of an issue and then

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,719
we started getting reached outs from

49
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:01,289
people you know mainly in Europe saying

50
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,179
hey how are you thinking about the

51
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:05,399
network given the current circumstances

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,200
and you know circumstances being that

53
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,820
people are being asked to stay home and

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,850
then very shortly thereafter people were

55
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,680
being told to stay home so you know we

56
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,950
we brought together our teams to figure

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,069
out what his capacity look like and you

58
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,410
know are we in a position to help ISPs

59
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:23,670
get more capacity in place quickly or do

60
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,910
we need to work on mitigate

61
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,040
if that's not possible and did you think

62
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,959
that this was a lot of hype at first or

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,120
did you really go into a state Dave of

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,300
like let's get people moving as quickly

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,010
as possible and set up war rooms I think

66
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,900
we jumped all over it I think we wanted

67
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,720
to better understand what our current

68
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,080
situation was in these markets you know

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,080
I would say we pretty quickly progressed

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,430
from just like okay this is

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,150
run-of-the-mill let's just figure out

72
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,350
what ASPI looks like too we have to do

73
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,209
something you have to convene as many

74
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,010
people as possible as quickly as

75
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,209
possible you know within a matter of a

76
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,190
few days at most

77
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,080
so it's interesting I don't know it

78
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,180
bounced over to you gram and Zurich you

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,459
just heard Dave say that it was Europe

80
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,900
that kind of first gave the call what

81
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,180
were things like for you in those

82
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,430
initial days and did you feel like we in

83
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,110
Europe were ahead because the numbers

84
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,910
were so much higher here before they

85
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,040
were reaching the states that it also

86
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,920
affected the state of Internet here as

87
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,530
well and say for those preparations for

88
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,809
over 19 started in late January but we

89
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,019
just a few days before cases started to

90
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,120
be reported outside of China no building

91
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,170
that works ahead of demand depends on

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,260
those making sure that we have a good

93
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,458
steady timely supply of hardware and so

94
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,040
it was important for us to immediately

95
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,680
start to act in a preventive way rather

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,400
than a reactive way so we dedicated a

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,840
team of members across our group to to

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,000
think about the kind of issues that were

99
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,320
likely to emerge before they did and so

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,290
for example we figured that the

101
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,420
availability of hardware safety

102
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,760
components from from Asia were likely to

103
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,950
be disrupted potentially longer lead

104
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,450
times etc so we needed Li expanded our

105
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,100
hardware inventories across regional

106
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,780
hubs just to try to mitigate those risks

107
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,390
and that was really quite key for us at

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,370
the time and did that did actually pan

109
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,070
out where he was your supply chain hit

110
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,750
and how hard it was hit but it was

111
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,180
actually quite delayed before we started

112
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,250
to see that it was probably a good three

113
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,289
four maybe even five weeks beyond that

114
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,539
that we started to hear from supplies I

115
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,490
think no longer provides to us so I

116
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,229
would say you know we acted early enough

117
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,789
to get the majority of our needs well

118
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,229
ahead of time there's probably a small

119
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:33,840
subset that we didn't achieve in time

120
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,849
and Rob does this all sound very

121
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,179
familiar or they're big differences in

122
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:39,909
how you were reacting at

123
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,410
Gast now very familiar I mean for us the

124
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,389
Chinese New Year was a big wake-up call

125
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,650
when we started noticing some of the

126
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,240
manufacturing facilities in China

127
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,758
weren't recovering from the holiday and

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,350
coming back to full supply in terms of

129
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,410
production so from there that really

130
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,419
kicked off a series of projects inside

131
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,949
Comcast to look at supply chain look

132
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:58,270
beyond just about our outing and

133
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:00,370
switching manufacturers but the sub

134
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,258
component levels understand where

135
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,280
they're being manufactured understanding

136
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,350
where we thought the weaknesses in the

137
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,969
supply chain would be working with you

138
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,860
know resellers to look at you know can

139
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,360
they start stocking here and I was to

140
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,639
keep us from having to encumber to capex

141
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,699
early as well as getting some orders in

142
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,620
place we started looking at the

143
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,060
redundancy our infrastructure and making

144
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,590
sure we were gained everything you know

145
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,139
we have a practice of trying to take the

146
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,340
sort of heavy hit high impact areas of

147
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,419
the network we take it out a service at

148
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,099
least once a quarter to make sure

149
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,469
redundancy works so we wanted everything

150
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:31,539
working there we started removing any

151
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,240
biases we had where if there were places

152
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,800
where one path was slightly faster than

153
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,570
another we would bias things with meds

154
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,669
or other tools to sort of drive

155
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,050
optimizations in the network we remove

156
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,219
some of those where it wasn't impactful

157
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,720
so that we were ready to take on

158
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,340
capacity and be able to absorb any

159
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,740
demand increases with redundancy that

160
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,330
was there and ultimately that proved to

161
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,880
be the trick in mid-march from the

162
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,740
traffic sort of tidal wave came in and

163
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,479
we have people watching and listening

164
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,190
from all around the world so I just want

165
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,659
to let everybody know if you have

166
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,820
questions we want to kind of do the

167
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:02,680
first 20 minutes just asking our

168
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,300
panelists questions but if you have

169
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,300
questions feel free to send them our way

170
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,120
and as quickly as we can we'll get to

171
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,710
them so Dave I'm just curious what was

172
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,270
the biggest challenge in the end there's

173
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,130
what you think is gonna happen and what

174
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,440
actually happens and what were some of

175
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:21,070
the really unexpected things that

176
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,990
actually happened fairly early on we

177
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,389
started talking to our peers in the

178
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,250
industry both on the isp side and on the

179
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,990
content provider side you know we had a

180
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,280
good ongoing dialogue with people from

181
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:35,070
Google and Facebook and Apple and others

182
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,719
but when you know the thing that really

183
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,360
was the biggest challenge frankly was

184
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,900
each country was handling his response

185
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,800
differently and what ended up happening

186
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,049
you know and obviously we're talking

187
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,430
about North American you know focus with

188
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,710
this group but you know we're a global

189
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,979
company what ended up happening

190
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,169
was we got reach outs from dozens of

191
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:58,180
regulators around the world where they

192
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,130
wanted to ensure that you know we were

193
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,289
going to do the right thing that we were

194
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,180
going to be helpful to the networks and

195
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:06,639
some took you know more kind of

196
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,120
responsibility for that than others and

197
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,850
so what it really was was multiple days

198
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,110
from my perspective of getting up really

199
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,449
early in the morning you're going to bed

200
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,830
really late at night in order to speak

201
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,479
with regulators all over the world

202
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,270
because they wanted to see water

203
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:26,110
Netflix's plans here and what we found

204
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,840
was in the countries where the regulator

205
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,430
was you know collaborative ie you know

206
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,289
places like the UK for example we've

207
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,240
received a reach out from Ofcom but

208
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:37,930
we've already been talking with ET and

209
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,180
LGI about what to do with the UK you

210
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,620
know before that had happened they more

211
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,789
or less we're just like hey great it's

212
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,430
good to hear that you're working on this

213
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,900
and and move forward in parallel to that

214
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,570
obviously we had a big technical

215
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,070
challenge which was let's look at how

216
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,930
much capacity we have in our different

217
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,099
markets where do we feel like that's an

218
00:07:52,930 --> 00:08:01,180
issue and then let's look at the

219
00:07:54,099 --> 00:08:03,940
performance of of our customers sessions

220
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,680
in each of these countries and let's

221
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,070
figure out already are we seeing issues

222
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,280
and you know frankly we saw a relatively

223
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,349
limited amounts of issues in most

224
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,510
markets in the world ie most were very

225
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,659
acute there wasn't some widespread issue

226
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,389
with our users quality of experience but

227
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:24,520
what we did see you know was that was

228
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,860
starting to degrade in some markets and

229
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,900
you know we had ISPs who are extremely

230
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,349
concerned about their overall backbone

231
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:35,529
capacity and their last mile capacity

232
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:38,550
both again mostly in Europe that as

233
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:40,689
things like elearning were ramping up

234
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,250
things like Netflix and others were

235
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,810
ramping up at the same time and they

236
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,250
were they were very concerned about what

237
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,959
the confluence of that was going to look

238
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,610
like and so that's really why we stayed

239
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,589
on top of that all the way all the way

240
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,390
through and it sounds pretty clear that

241
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,100
things maybe weren't as bad as some

242
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,020
might have expected but I'm just curious

243
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,600
if we're things not as bad as expected

244
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,029
because of those changes that you made

245
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,500
in those initial days or just because of

246
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,540
the progress that you've made over the

247
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,670
years it was

248
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,099
ready for something like this I think

249
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,689
both frankly I think that the internet

250
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,639
was ready the internet rose to the

251
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,320
challenge if we you know speak of the

252
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,509
internet as one the holistic global

253
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,250
network it rose to the challenge quite

254
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:20,009
well I think the issues that we saw were

255
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,009
quite acute I do think that in some

256
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:25,199
limited cases you know the changes that

257
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:27,540
we made and Google and others made

258
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:31,050
absolutely helped with capacity

259
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,149
management in an insert an uncertain

260
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,889
time it's unprecedented we didn't know

261
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:37,110
so what extent people were going to be

262
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:39,690
really learning what extent people

263
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,980
needed a c4 for telemedicine and things

264
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,380
like that and so we were just trying to

265
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,139
be as collaborative as we can because to

266
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,899
your point you know we didn't know it's

267
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:49,920
a still an open question really of you

268
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,139
know I think I think we're gonna be

269
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,639
looking at studies about that could be

270
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,680
performance of Internet and this time

271
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,649
for years to come we don't know exactly

272
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,359
how well it performed like as a global

273
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:03,420
network but I think locally view saw

274
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,880
perform great and Rob I'm just curious

275
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,979
over at Comcast what were the biggest

276
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,420
challenges you faced and what is

277
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,519
something that you just didn't see

278
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,670
coming that ended up being a material

279
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,079
issue um I think our biggest challenge

280
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,550
frankly because we build a lot of

281
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,229
redundancy in the network and once you

282
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,459
sort of make sure it's able to be used

283
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,709
during steady state you know we were

284
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:24,180
able to absorb a lot of the demand even

285
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,979
in places like the Northeast where you

286
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,209
had lockdowns coupled with some late

287
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,690
march weather that so it gives you a

288
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,979
duplicate of impact on demand um the

289
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,990
biggest challenge we had was really

290
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,000
taking those sort of monthly practices

291
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,190
we had for whatching capacity and

292
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,449
building our plans and buildings for two

293
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,970
to four weeks sort of a you know

294
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,439
Sprint's to moving them almost a daily

295
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,870
with the workforce that that's entirely

296
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,069
at home right and so I think as a

297
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,630
culture a lot of us were sort of

298
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:49,680
videocamera off prior to this because

299
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,870
we're used to working in the same

300
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,699
facility where you can talk to each

301
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,899
other suddenly you know working from

302
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:57,479
home and video conferencing became

303
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:59,670
absolutely critical making sure we had

304
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,829
enough VPN capacity making sure people

305
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,300
we hit me built schedules that had

306
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,680
change windows that were sort of

307
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,000
conducive to the network given that we

308
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,399
had totally different demographics can

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,110
use with much more business critical use

310
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,870
by our residential base during the day

311
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,339
now to UM you know schedules that were

312
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,810
conducive to parents that now had to

313
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,960
deal with kids at home in fishing to

314
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,930
there with their load there

315
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,430
so the human aspect for us was as as

316
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,329
critical as the network impact aspect um

317
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,040
something that really impressed me about

318
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,810
this and I saw this with my team as well

319
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,310
as sort of industry peers is you know 25

320
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,589
years ago when I started doing this in

321
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,479
the 90s there was an altruism

322
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,950
in places like nanog and serve the

323
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,900
internet in general we were trying to do

324
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,580
the right thing for everybody to just

325
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,980
accelerate innovation on the network and

326
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,000
you really saw that again I mean Dave

327
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,700
mentioned it but I think you'll hear

328
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,110
from all of us the ecosystem really came

329
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,490
together well to be transparent about

330
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,740
what they're trying to do what they're

331
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,870
going to do we were accommodating and I

332
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,520
think um it was really invigorating to

333
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,080
see that sort of altruism show up again

334
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,079
it doesn't always show up in a day to

335
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,550
day in business also we were really

336
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,110
excited about that yeah I think

337
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,760
everybody knows here that a lot of these

338
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,110
companies have had their differences but

339
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,640
it's been really interesting and talking

340
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,470
to you guys behind the scenes and

341
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,780
hearing from other people in this field

342
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,760
how much people came together it was all

343
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,709
hands on deck not just in one company

344
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,510
but people talking to people using those

345
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,820
contacts that maybe they had to now know

346
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,950
that I hadn't talked to in a long time

347
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,550
and making it happen so that everything

348
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,160
could keep on moving smoothly Graham for

349
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,500
you for Google what was the single

350
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,990
biggest challenge that maybe you hadn't

351
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,650
seen coming down the pipeline as Kovac

352
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,640
moved west across the world so a lot of

353
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,560
the things that we've heard from Dave

354
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,120
and Rob definitely resonate with me we

355
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,160
typically plan on network several

356
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,530
quarters in the banks and to a fairly

357
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,120
prescriptive level of detail and what we

358
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,410
were forced to do was really to start to

359
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,080
look at things on a much more frequent

360
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,839
basis I'd say they're looking back we

361
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,180
saw strong double-digit growth in our

362
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,220
traffic through q1 it was generally

363
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,449
within our capacity to manage this but

364
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,250
the level of uncertainty was obviously

365
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,230
really high particularly for operators

366
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,430
and regulators to datapoint

367
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,810
it would he want to make sure that the

368
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,030
internet continued to work well for

369
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,770
people as they transition there they're

370
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,839
working to hope and also there they're

371
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,970
learning to not sure we take that

372
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,320
responsibility very seriously they don't

373
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,200
think we could to both boost capacity

374
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,400
but also to try to address demand and

375
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,130
when they talk about adjusting demand

376
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,930
I'm primarily referring to YouTube being

377
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,330
moved to a standard definition by the

378
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,800
falls of course it's a video

379
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,000
conferencing was the other area that we

380
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,430
particularly had to focus on

381
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,439
and so you know away from the CDN by the

382
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,508
end of February as lockdown started to

383
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:37,459
be implemented took me in Italy in Spain

384
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,800
there were huge numbers of people who

385
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,268
were moving to study from home and work

386
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,339
from home and that was driving

387
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,980
substantial added demand for a video

388
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:48,500
conferencing so this meet so in early

389
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,540
March we enabled meet by default for all

390
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,660
cheese suite users later that month we

391
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,370
had seen a surge of 25x the demand that

392
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,589
we've seen in January so clearly those

393
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,300
are numbers that you try to plan for but

394
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:01,639
it's still it's it's still a big deal

395
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,258
right so this brought some pressures to

396
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,959
our front end service and also to our

397
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,699
pairing infrastructure and so as

398
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:09,199
additional hardware to address that

399
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:10,008
started to land through the month of

400
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,319
March

401
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:14,509
our engineers who had full knowledge of

402
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:16,759
the hardware and software stack they

403
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:18,350
were unable to freely travel to all

404
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,240
locations and I'd say that was one of

405
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,040
the key challenges that we had so we had

406
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,860
to find ways of working with Ramona pans

407
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,779
and facilities and guiding what were

408
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,850
really really involved installation

409
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,990
tasks via videoconference and that was

410
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,850
something that was new frozen we just

411
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,990
had to get creative

412
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,980
I'm just gives I'm gonna last this for

413
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,689
all of you but I'll just stay with you

414
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,129
for a second Graham and just remind you

415
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:39,829
to everybody they're free to send in

416
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:42,620
their questions grab any interesting

417
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:45,319
usage pattern change that you can tell

418
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,149
us about I mean we we all love those

419
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,800
kind of insights of when people do what

420
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:51,589
so I'll start with you and it and then

421
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,569
ask the other members of the panel sure

422
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,579
so mean through February I YouTube for

423
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:57,920
example saw growth that's from they

424
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:59,329
exceeded any of our forecasts usage

425
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,339
patterns were particularly interesting

426
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:03,920
they were changing so rather than seeing

427
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,480
hugely higher peak traffic we were

428
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,729
actually seeing a high end midday

429
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,059
traffic and a greater distribution of

430
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,769
that demand more across the day and so

431
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:15,139
to put that into some specifics we were

432
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:19,309
actually seeing almost twice as much

433
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:21,829
demand at 85% of the actual peak or

434
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:24,139
above compared to what we would have

435
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:27,138
seen quite a couple 19 so really a very

436
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:28,879
extended day of usage as people who are

437
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:31,309
just making more use of the services and

438
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,500
Dave did you see something similar with

439
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:36,350
Netflix in terms of usage patterns he

440
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,179
did you know and and it's interesting

441
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,529
because you know we'd already started

442
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:41,260
augmenting some of our infrastructure

443
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:42,730
like for the end of the year

444
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,189
you know we're already starting that in

445
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,690
March or April and as we looked at what

446
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,420
our forecasts look like we're like okay

447
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:53,020
well how is this going to come together

448
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:55,449
and to Grandma's point what we saw was a

449
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,449
lot more mid day usage so we definitely

450
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,490
saw a you know rise to near peak and

451
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,680
then I just hang out there for for a

452
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,420
large part of the day and then the

453
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,010
evening peak actually just looked you

454
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,089
know very similar to what it would look

455
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,950
like before we do see that though across

456
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,110
war days obviously you know we used to

457
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,600
see more watching on certain days of the

458
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,890
week and it was little flatter and as

459
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,830
you know you probably saw in our

460
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:23,400
quarterly results you know we also saw a

461
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:26,650
lot of new subscribers in some markets

462
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,840
that you know made us think also about

463
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,550
capacity planning but in general like

464
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,850
again their their usage patterns were

465
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:36,089
quite similar and robbed same question

466
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:39,160
for you what type of interesting user

467
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,540
pattern can you tell us about initially

468
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,920
initially going into March you know peak

469
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,500
was still weekend it was still the same

470
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,380
nights um it was more but it was a

471
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,640
little earlier but as things kept going

472
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,230
what we're starting to notice now and

473
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,360
this is sort of recent ISM Tuesday's

474
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,240
sort of the new Friday wait we've got a

475
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,220
large a small number of CDNs doing some

476
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,750
very very major releases Tuesday and

477
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,220
there's a minority of them that are

478
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,510
still doing it during crime time and so

479
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,790
we're starting to see usage pattern on

480
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,470
Tuesday night almost reflect what we're

481
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,260
seeing on weekends and that was

482
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,449
unexpected and I guess this is

483
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,760
particularly cute for Comcast what was

484
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:14,230
the you know upload versus download was

485
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,430
there a huge change in that type of

486
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,680
pattern

487
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,209
Oh certainly growth in upstream traffic

488
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,910
with all the video conferencing going on

489
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,560
downstream still dominates the the over

490
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,930
the all traffic carnage but we've seen

491
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,629
upstream growth like downstream you know

492
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,950
growth as much as a third and do you

493
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,390
think I'll just stick with you for a

494
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,790
second Robin always curious as a

495
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,470
reporter because we do get things wrong

496
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,540
often so it's important to reflect

497
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,550
anything that you saw reported in the

498
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,350
mainstream media by folks like me

499
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,300
perhaps that you thought you know it

500
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,040
just didn't capture it correctly that

501
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,510
that wasn't really what was going on to

502
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,820
the story had changed him there looking

503
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,830
back well I think is the demographics

504
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,450
you know if to work from home came out

505
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,240
there was certainly some speculation

506
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,380
that

507
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,670
work from home activities like video

508
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,140
conferencing that start to dominate the

509
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,940
internet and while they certainly grew

510
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,110
and we watched it very very closely

511
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,250
because we're very kind of but that

512
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,290
became those are business critical

513
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,400
applications the peak was still sitting

514
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,440
at you know like I said the peak was

515
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,270
still on weekends it was still people

516
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,559
getting home and watching Netflix

517
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,610
they're watching a little earlier for

518
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:13,520
whatever reason maybe they'll have a

519
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:16,040
commute but you know I think the traffic

520
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,389
patterns largely in mass whoops look

521
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,080
similar to what they did before they

522
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,580
were just larger and go in terms of

523
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,689
going into details and reporters quite

524
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,040
frankly we were working in admin

525
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,150
capacity so I don't watch a lot of news

526
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,340
through the second half of March where

527
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,510
you're just pumping so uh you'd have to

528
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,909
tell me it like if you get it wrong

529
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,980
sometimes that might be better for your

530
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,350
sanity Dave anything that you saw that

531
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,270
later on you just struck you as the

532
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:42,770
story was different from what you were

533
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:44,780
seeing play out in the media say it's

534
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:47,000
basically the same exact thing as Rob

535
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,639
which is you know there wasn't some

536
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,470
apocalypse brewing it just generally you

537
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,120
know we grew we all work together and

538
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,040
things were great you know some of the

539
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,139
press stories were like oh you know ISP

540
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,240
is really mad at you know at Netflix

541
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,100
were at Google or someone and at the end

542
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,140
of the day we were quite collaborative

543
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,610
with all but basically all of our

544
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,130
partners around the world I think we had

545
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,570
great discussions with all of them and I

546
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,059
think everyone just wanted to work

547
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,230
together and to come together and figure

548
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:16,520
out how to best serve all of our

549
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:18,440
customers grandma I'm curious for if you

550
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,809
can help us on this one data center

551
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:25,730
networks and computer resources how are

552
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:26,960
they affected if activists are one of

553
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,390
the few areas of our production

554
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,490
infrastructure which continue to require

555
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,660
people to be doing hands-on work so

556
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,850
that's quite a distinction from the

557
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,470
wrestlers working from home so what we

558
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,300
did was we split our datacenter staff

559
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,980
into multiple separate teams at each

560
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,500
site to rotate through those teams to

561
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,630
try to thoughtfully minimize exposure in

562
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,429
terms of compute resources that was not

563
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,920
an area that we had any problems with

564
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:50,600
our compute resources are built on top

565
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,429
of large amounts of proprietary hardware

566
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,110
and that means we control a lot of the

567
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:56,630
idea parts of our supply chain and have

568
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:59,270
good visibility into components and to

569
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,520
into logistics providers I'd say that

570
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,620
from an efficiency perspective we have

571
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,870
the capability to shift lower priority

572
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,850
workloads to use off-peak capacity and

573
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,429
maximize the capacity available that is

574
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,719
really requiring a peek but until now we

575
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,820
haven't suffered any shortfall in

576
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,400
compute resources so no issues to make

577
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,649
sense of sight in Graham I'm curious

578
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,850
about subsea cables every time I talk to

579
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,130
somebody in your field they say you've

580
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,559
got to ask this but they also rolled

581
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,730
their eyes at the same time so I want to

582
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,440
go there I want to figure out why do I

583
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,050
have to ask this and why is almost

584
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,600
everybody rolling their eyes I mean I

585
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,159
think that there is such such an

586
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,870
importance to us subsea infrastructure

587
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,120
generally and supported the internet

588
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,649
these days and with the data volumes

589
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,059
growing hugely as they have done over

590
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,010
the years naturally there is a real

591
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,899
fascination with the outages that can

592
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,340
actually have a real impact I say from

593
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,650
our side we have not had anything to

594
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,840
take the relevant to report so I'm sorry

595
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,190
to be a bit boring in this respect not

596
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,439
something interesting on the debt on the

597
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,770
subsea side from the most effective Dave

598
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,230
I see you chuckling there I know I mean

599
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,000
it everyone loves a good doomsday

600
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,920
scenario right but that's not what

601
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,050
happened

602
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,220
Rob in the insights on these subsea

603
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:15,720
cables that fascinate so many people

604
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:18,150
know that makes it pretty clear I'm just

605
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,890
curious a bit more about automation I

606
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,080
mean it sounds like we're talking about

607
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,970
scenarios that maybe had never happened

608
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,720
before so I'm curious to see how

609
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,670
automation played a role in the reaction

610
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,260
Robb's and so you didn't have much to

611
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,570
say about the last one I'll let you pick

612
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,559
up this one well certainly I mean for

613
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,540
the network infrastructure I mean

614
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,809
automation has been driving that work

615
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:42,059
config for a number of years and so if I

616
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:44,970
look at if I look at situations where

617
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,379
we've had massive demand surges or

618
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,760
infrastructures that come in structure

619
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,130
that comes down and threatened by you

620
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,300
know we're running our redundancy the

621
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,100
network is behaving more predictably

622
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,320
than it ever has been great I mean

623
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,459
outage minutes are down orders of

624
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,809
magnitude where they were three or four

625
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,750
years ago when we were still doing a lot

626
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:01,950
of manual type into the network and so

627
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,630
automation had a big part in running a

628
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,280
stable Network before Kovan and it had a

629
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:08,160
big part of keeping a stable network

630
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,820
during koban interestingly you know

631
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,500
things that

632
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,510
used to have really minimal human

633
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,700
interaction on the way to getting done

634
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,530
we actually de evolved a little bit and

635
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,570
drove up the human conversations right

636
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,010
and so we had a lot more human

637
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,840
interaction between for instance our

638
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,000
security team and our networking team as

639
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,679
things were growing day over day

640
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,850
stand-ups in which the whole company was

641
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,670
getting together to look at conflict

642
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,830
resolution number post changes and so on

643
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,600
some extent automation certainly drove a

644
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,060
lot of the stability and the ability to

645
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,409
absorb a lot of the demand but turning

646
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,320
up the human interactions caught a lot

647
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:43,000
of stuff too and really helped us avoid

648
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,280
dangerous situations for customers that

649
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,650
gives me a lot of hope for employment

650
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,480
numbers Graham was it similar for you

651
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,240
was there maybe an uptick and having to

652
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,040
have those face-to-face albeit by a

653
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,810
camera conversations as opposed to

654
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,570
automation or the automation really take

655
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:01,720
up with the CDM that we that we operate

656
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,800
we are lucky enough to impart with many

657
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,110
many different than some providers

658
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,970
across the world and I did something

659
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,429
that really plays well towards

660
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,810
automation and so when we're looking at

661
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,490
the CDM understanding what we should be

662
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,840
doing to scale it in different locations

663
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,880
we're making full use of over the data

664
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,409
available so in this situation because

665
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,940
we could see things moving fast an

666
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,740
automation would start to detect it

667
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,910
we're essentially just taking steps to

668
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,100
make sure that we would lower for

669
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,840
example the utilization at which we

670
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,889
would start a plan for an upgrade and

671
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,020
we'll be engaged in some of those

672
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,620
partner networks too to prime them ahead

673
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,270
of time

674
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,709
I suppose one of the key things there

675
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,210
which which is quite aside from

676
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,680
automation that kind of flowed into it

677
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,090
we reached out to a lot of incent

678
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,380
providers around the world to ask for

679
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,970
their insights about the kind of

680
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,310
practical constraints that they were

681
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,470
experiencing on the ground it's all well

682
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:46,659
and good for us to sit on hardware that

683
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,770
we can ship to again destination but if

684
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,240
we can't actually get it there because

685
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,830
of logistics would it be can't actually

686
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,440
deliver to site because it's not man

687
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,879
what if the field engineers for that isp

688
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,560
are not able to actually go on the road

689
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,450
and actually get that installed so I

690
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,590
think tapping into those internet

691
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,300
providers and then bringing in

692
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,730
essentially crowd sourcing their inputs

693
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,590
into automation system using that as an

694
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,420
additional kind of signal layer to

695
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,530
define where a priority should be that

696
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,000
was one of the things that we made some

697
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,370
changes to in terms of automation and

698
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,840
Dave I'm curious how much this question

699
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,719
and about automation even applies to

700
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,419
Netflix oh and we do tons of automation

701
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,390
of the person who introduced this panel

702
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,230
of runs on Network automation for us it

703
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,590
absolutely

704
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,780
us to deploy our infrastructure you know

705
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,540
where we could as quickly as we possibly

706
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,860
could in a way that if everything was

707
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:37,559
manual would never would have been able

708
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:40,840
to do and our automation runs the entire

709
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:42,668
process both in how we interconnect with

710
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,370
networks and when we put caches inside

711
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:47,740
of networks all the way from when a

712
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:50,799
network requests it through how it gets

713
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,020
you from either whether it's a cache or

714
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,150
an interconnect through how that cache

715
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,160
or that interconnect gets configured if

716
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:59,290
it's a cache how it gets filled out get

717
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,390
shipped out how it gets installed all of

718
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:04,000
those pieces are automated almost as

719
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:06,130
much as it possibly can which allows us

720
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,610
to run a very lean team which especially

721
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:11,830
right now is incredibly important you

722
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,020
know that we are a relatively small team

723
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,520
that can share context very rapidly

724
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,860
because of that which allows us to

725
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,620
respond the things very quickly and so

726
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,209
all those things kind of came together

727
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,879
and I think that that automation

728
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:27,490
absolutely drove the quality of our

729
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,929
response in the speeder and and Dave

730
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,370
that kind of sentiment perfectly for the

731
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:31,840
next question that I wanted to ask you

732
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,969
because there's been a debate among

733
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,189
among tech journalist and in your

734
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,500
through the well as well about was it

735
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,960
really the protocols of the internet all

736
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,570
those years ago that allowed for things

737
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,370
to go smoothly throughout the Kovach

738
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:48,879
crisis or was it more about the

739
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:51,129
widespread deployment of cache like the

740
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,110
the Google global cache which certainly

741
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,059
you know asked Graham about well what do

742
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,918
you think really made the backbone

743
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:58,840
strong I wish I wish I could like spear

744
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,059
share my screen and like put up the meme

745
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,070
that's like why not both because it is

746
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,480
absolutely both I think that you know

747
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:07,570
you look back to our internet

748
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,370
forefathers the people who designed and

749
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,049
first implemented so many of the

750
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,299
protocols that we use today that we have

751
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:17,410
you know obviously evolved and and

752
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:19,450
expanded upon those were built for the

753
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,790
fault tolerance that we needed and to be

754
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,679
able to work in a world where there may

755
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,590
be congestion or maybe contention for

756
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,020
the network and so that plus also the

757
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,840
fact that many of the large users

758
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:35,168
bandwidth have you know reduced their

759
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,090
reliance on on backbone networks which

760
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:39,610
then increases the velocity

761
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:41,409
of getting additional capacity out there

762
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,510
there's fewer things to upgrade it's

763
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:45,730
easier to do I think absolutely

764
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:49,450
contributed to that and so I think it

765
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:51,130
all comes together and puts us in a

766
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,110
position where we've seen that the

767
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:57,100
Internet can scale and grow even in

768
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:59,350
crisis and in Rob or Graham it's similar

769
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,449
I'll let you guys jump in is similar

770
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,209
answer though is it just both the the

771
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,890
meme is correct Rob maybe I'll start

772
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,410
with you yeah I think that's the case

773
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,880
right again you've got a reliable

774
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,130
transport to deal with any sort of micro

775
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,390
congestion or you know things congestion

776
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,820
them would have been there in the

777
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,530
beginning we have great load sharing

778
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,610
schemas to be able to traffic engineer

779
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,550
and sort of make sure he can absorb

780
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,840
demand and then we you know obviously

781
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,669
placement of content in the right places

782
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,610
to get them close to customers as well

783
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:29,080
these guys know what better than I do is

784
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,750
also critical to experience and so

785
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,250
absolutely both graham anything

786
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,190
different there so I move on to the next

787
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,140
question I'd agree with just with just

788
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,550
that I just give a quick shout out to

789
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,720
the folks involved in the codecs right

790
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,129
because essentially trying to make sure

791
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,810
that we are optimally and what we are

792
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,390
transmitting across the insight is

793
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,460
always okay and both Netflix and Google

794
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,020
and many other companies in our case

795
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,030
YouTube is a prime driver of this

796
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,160
working really hard to make sure that

797
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,210
codecs are put in place to be efficient

798
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,110
with the dates that were transferring

799
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:02,350
people's something yeah I would fully

800
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:04,419
agree with that just to add is that you

801
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:07,209
know we and we've worked with industry

802
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:09,640
partners all over the spectrum you know

803
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,500
we've worked as hard as we possibly can

804
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,510
to make Netflix look as great as

805
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,360
possible in as little bandwidth as

806
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,860
possible and so if you look at some of

807
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,810
our codecs you know over the years we've

808
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,250
actually used less bandwidth for

809
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,500
significantly better video quality

810
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,960
because that space just continues to

811
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,850
evolve and so the fact that we when

812
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,910
those those technologies are available

813
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,290
when we've helped develop some of them

814
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:33,970
we implement them as quickly as we

815
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,409
possibly can we think that's important

816
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,660
for remember experience we think it's

817
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,220
important to our partner networks you

818
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,080
know reduces their cost to deliver our

819
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,420
traffic and just generally provides

820
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,590
people with a better experience so we

821
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,060
have questions coming in from the

822
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,280
audience and Dave there's one

823
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,168
specifically for you so we'll stay with

824
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,989
you for a second and it

825
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:55,989
previous talk slide from Nokia it seemed

826
00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:59,139
Netflix traffic growth moved much more

827
00:28:55,989 --> 00:29:01,210
toward peering linked versus local cash

828
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:02,859
can you talk about this and give some

829
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,289
insight into why this might have

830
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:08,489
happened Dave sure I'll give you a give

831
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:13,509
you B might have happened answer when

832
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:15,100
she robbed laughing when we deploy

833
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:17,109
CAPTCHAs and networks we generally

834
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,879
deploy that to demand and you know

835
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:21,158
frankly we'll give a cash to a network

836
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:23,738
that wants it you know meeting certain

837
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,840
very minimal criteria and we'll give

838
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:27,820
them as much capacity as we think that

839
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,129
they need for some reasonable amount of

840
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,678
time which will then allow them to to

841
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:34,809
grow into that capacity and then we work

842
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:36,879
with them in our ongoing basis to to

843
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:40,178
plan adding additional capacity going

844
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:42,969
forward but those tend to be the places

845
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:45,609
of the most capacity contention the

846
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,710
deepest ago zones network and so what

847
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:49,689
what happened in some cases was that

848
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,700
some of that traffic then fell back on

849
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,830
to peering links because the cache is

850
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:58,149
that the edge were you know quite well

851
00:29:53,830 --> 00:30:00,460
utilized and you know that in concert

852
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:02,258
with just changing viewing patterns

853
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,350
meant that you know our system had to

854
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:07,359
adjust and adapt and you know we've

855
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,549
worked the partners we very rapidly

856
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,710
shift some of them caches that needed

857
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,359
them as quickly as possible and you know

858
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,129
we're thinking about now what is ask

859
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,549
claimant look like for the next you know

860
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:20,949
six to 12 months to avoid that but that

861
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:23,019
shows again the Internet is robust it's

862
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,609
not that Netflix degraded it's not that

863
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:26,289
Google or other things degraded it's

864
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:28,210
that the traffic shift around shifted

865
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:32,350
around the paths that we all thought we

866
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:33,970
might need and so we built them grim I'd

867
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,009
like to pick up with you on the next

868
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,960
question because you alluded to this at

869
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:40,389
the top of the discussion people want to

870
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,789
know how the supply chain effects are

871
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:44,709
being accounted for now and are they

872
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:46,649
still as prevalent since you talked

873
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,980
about the the effects having that lag

874
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:53,768
the lag on that in the first part of all

875
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,570
this no I'd say we're not having issues

876
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:58,720
anymore from our perspective it's

877
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:01,450
probably a good I would say four to five

878
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,380
weeks since we started to see

879
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,330
significant relief

880
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,250
on the supply chain side whatever that

881
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:11,389
would come down to where we were

882
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:14,330
procuring a hardware from and so I think

883
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:16,460
what we looked at was what creative

884
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,889
means are available for us to divert

885
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,570
around particular hotspots thicker areas

886
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,250
that are suffering right now and have

887
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,439
clearly locked down so generally

888
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,120
speaking the sourcing hardware eased up

889
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,950
quite some time ago as you can imagine

890
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,209
though in terms of forward logistics and

891
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,820
those being able to move that Hardware

892
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,070
out towards internet providers in in our

893
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,230
case that continued to be constrained

894
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,120
and in some cases still is if you look

895
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,220
at the widely publicized lockdown across

896
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,449
India clearly you know the kind of

897
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,760
equipment that we were looking to send

898
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,730
them was was not critical equipment as

899
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,260
his food and means for life therefore

900
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,480
when he had to take a back seat there

901
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,250
and wait it out eaten those in there

902
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,310
starting to lift and so therefore we're

903
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,900
in a better position at this and Robin

904
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:59,030
is that it's a more situation true now

905
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,700
I'm curious about future upgrades to

906
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:04,580
systems have those had to be delayed at

907
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,230
all as a result of the supply chain no I

908
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,210
mean taking this sudden increase in

909
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:11,540
demand and we essentially grew by a few

910
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:12,650
quarters in two weeks right and so good

911
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,850
news is a lot of future upgrades are

912
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,500
done right I mean what we're still

913
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:18,620
watching growth and we'll respond as we

914
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,990
can and I think in our in our sense that

915
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,280
the supply chain is largely look like

916
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,540
they're largely behind us we still have

917
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,770
some key milestones before the end of

918
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,080
the second quarter where we're expecting

919
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,400
some deliveries and if you look at the

920
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,169
sub component level there's still some

921
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,510
sort of trickling of constraints moving

922
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,920
through the system but we feel pretty

923
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,690
good I think we've been really fortunate

924
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,610
to be able to have good transparency

925
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,670
from our audience witching and optical

926
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:42,649
vendors fairly good contact down their

927
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,820
supply chain with with sub component

928
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,980
manufacturers so we understand what's

929
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,389
going on on the ground there and good

930
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,940
business relationships people like you

931
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,080
know VARs where we need to if we want to

932
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,730
sort of bulk up without sort of

933
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,710
extending the capex ourselves you know

934
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,910
that that's a great way to so we get

935
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,770
some Hardware going in the pipeline so

936
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,000
where you stay ahead of demand so we

937
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,710
feel pretty good at this point and not

938
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,290
over the next month we'll be able to

939
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,870
grow an assessment and in Graham just so

940
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,030
I'm clear hardware retirement does that

941
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:10,340
change the timeline going back to you

942
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,860
for a second yeah sure it was one of the

943
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,010
aspects that we moved towards one

944
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,969
particular aspect that we address was

945
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,950
hardware failures

946
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,140
standing that we had to prioritize we

947
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,669
did that we also adjusted our automation

948
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,620
to move more quickly but you're

949
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:27,049
absolutely right the retirement of

950
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,549
existing platforms was something that we

951
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:29,510
looked at closely and the last thing you

952
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:31,190
want to do when you have a lot of

953
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,690
uncertainty in the system is to back

954
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,610
away our weather there's certainly

955
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,370
useful purpose today so we did take the

956
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,570
decision to defer the retirement of

957
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,830
platforms in the feeder from spaces just

958
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,799
making sure that we had additional

959
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,840
Headroom we're getting more questions in

960
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,110
so Dave I'll bounce bounce back to you

961
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,780
how is this experience changed designs

962
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:53,719
operations planning and logistics going

963
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:56,120
forward from this point you know

964
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,700
logistics we've had similar supply chain

965
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,899
issues that other people mentioned

966
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,730
that's probably the biggest thing that's

967
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,679
changed for us is just thinking about

968
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,940
well first of all with the fact that

969
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,929
there's very little commercial air

970
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,960
traffic right now

971
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:11,149
one of the main ways that we ship our

972
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,740
caches is by a commercial freight and

973
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:15,348
one of the main you know commercial

974
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:16,969
freight carriers is like you know United

975
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:20,480
in American Airlines it's the best ways

976
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:22,158
to get and Delta to get a you know a

977
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,560
server from here to Hong Kong for

978
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,659
example and so we've had to think about

979
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,570
how can we get cargo space booked on the

980
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:31,790
larger you know cargo carriers to get

981
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,589
our servers shipped but in the larger

982
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,080
scheme of things I think that what we're

983
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:37,940
thinking about is like how can we just

984
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,139
be better prepared from a communications

985
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,089
perspective how can we communicate

986
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,040
better with our partners how can you get

987
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:45,529
better with regulators you know if this

988
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:50,869
happened again in some form the end of

989
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:52,550
the day speaking with you know prop

990
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:54,919
dozens of regulators around the world

991
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,200
just doesn't scale and so you know they

992
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,150
some of them have unique problems

993
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,098
depending on the market but others have

994
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,050
very similar problems others and so I

995
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,390
think figuring out how to kind of up

996
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,280
that cooperation layer beyond the NOC

997
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:11,259
and the rights and the other you know

998
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,580
network groups of the world up to the

999
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,380
regulator level who would have an

1000
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,790
interest in this I think would help us a

1001
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,330
lot in the future it would help all

1002
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,050
networks a lot in the future just so

1003
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,848
that they can get their questions

1004
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,320
answered so they can know that there

1005
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:26,869
were that we're working with them and

1006
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,730
we're working you know to to make the

1007
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:29,810
Internet as a whole as stable as

1008
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,820
possible

1009
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,230
yeah I'm working here in Europe

1010
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,060
reporting here in Europe it's certainly

1011
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,730
a concern that I hear from a lot of tech

1012
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,320
companies just dealing with the very

1013
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,840
many regulators that they have here

1014
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,900
across the European Union or for as long

1015
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,850
as I in the UK and absolutely Europe is

1016
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,470
a great example where you have the EU

1017
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:53,390
has has a regulator that is you know

1018
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:55,220
specific to internet and telecom but

1019
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,799
also the neat country in many cases have

1020
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,209
their own regulators as well Rob I just

1021
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,610
want to put that same question to you

1022
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,010
from the audience member designs

1023
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:05,750
operations planning logistics going

1024
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:08,810
forward how has that all been affected

1025
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,580
by this crisis um I think it's some

1026
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:12,290
regard it really strengthened our

1027
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,480
resolve to stick to some practices that

1028
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,460
we had going in which is around again

1029
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,470
constant wargaming's people you know

1030
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,060
term chaos monkey was a popular a few

1031
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,470
years ago this is much more well

1032
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,540
orchestrated and much more intense

1033
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,950
--fill but um taking infrastructure out

1034
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,290
of service as frequently as we can

1035
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:29,000
during peak times so we know everything

1036
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,890
works has been something that we're

1037
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,950
we've absolutely committed to again

1038
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:35,480
because it's it's it really proved here

1039
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,310
from an Operations standpoint I think we

1040
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,600
we certainly doubled down on the

1041
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:41,509
coordination and planning around

1042
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,400
impactful Network change because we were

1043
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:47,000
very sensitive to the change in server

1044
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,560
usage patterns of our users and I'd love

1045
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,480
to see those practices continue to sort

1046
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,580
of stay very very tightly engaged across

1047
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,050
disciplines and not going not let it

1048
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,759
fall back to sort of siloed change

1049
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:58,180
control processes like you might see in

1050
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:02,210
sort of a standard the AU operating mode

1051
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:03,950
I more personal note for the team I

1052
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,450
think um you know we've been at Comcast

1053
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,740
we've been pretty poor about remote

1054
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,509
working you know it's something that we

1055
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,520
do as an exception not as a rule and

1056
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,990
this is certainly opened our eyes that

1057
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,570
you know collaboration can be very very

1058
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:16,100
successful so imagining will probably

1059
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,870
come back to the office with a little

1060
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:21,020
more flexibility like my partners in

1061
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,220
this panel already have they will look

1062
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,290
at that more look at that much more

1063
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,120
intently well I'll stay with you then

1064
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:28,160
for a second Rob because somebody asked

1065
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,410
how did you and your team's balance new

1066
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,410
work demands with do new demands and

1067
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:34,879
stresses outside of work so yeah we

1068
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,680
talked before and you talked about this

1069
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,590
is kind of new for you work from home in

1070
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,899
the Comcast culture so any personal

1071
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,610
anecdotes or people walking in in the

1072
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,830
middle of conferences

1073
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,780
I love the professor in South Korea with

1074
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:50,210
the the baby and the mom coming through

1075
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,830
flying through the the door yeah I mean

1076
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,970
sure there was all sorts of that stuff I

1077
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:55,730
think you know we went into this thing

1078
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,560
as a network engineering team fully

1079
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:00,020
committing to the you know success and

1080
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,100
safety of our team first right and if

1081
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,780
they take care of that the rest of it

1082
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,750
takes care of itself and so when you

1083
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,430
look across the fairly large team the

1084
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,660
varying needs of people you know you

1085
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,129
really can't accommodate everyone's

1086
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,359
individual needs and still end up with a

1087
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,650
pretty wide coverage plan for the

1088
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,630
network right because people have

1089
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:17,900
different sort of obligations in life

1090
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:19,400
and so you know I there's there's plenty

1091
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,930
of stories of people your kids running

1092
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,730
by or people you know hearing screaming

1093
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,899
babies and dogs barking and so the

1094
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,120
standard stuff you sort of hear about

1095
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,610
conference calls forever but by and

1096
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,140
large you know one of the things we had

1097
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:32,570
to focus on was really telling people to

1098
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,980
unplug I mean when you've got you get

1099
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,800
used to that video screen right there in

1100
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,970
the laptop right there it's easy to sort

1101
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,110
of get into that every eight minutes

1102
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:41,779
checking what's going on with the

1103
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:43,220
network sort of mode and so getting

1104
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,030
people to take vacation was a little

1105
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,169
tougher than we thought it would be

1106
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,030
right

1107
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,470
making sure people punched out spent

1108
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,060
though that really long quality time

1109
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:51,319
with their families um that was

1110
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,759
something we were attentive to that I

1111
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,560
didn't anticipate needing to do that

1112
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,700
going yeah and Dave I know you have

1113
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,279
something to add to this and I'll just

1114
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,290
share anecdotally were two people here

1115
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,570
my fiance works in finance in the first

1116
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,759
weeks we realized that the work day was

1117
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,260
getting so much longer as so many people

1118
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,200
have experience and just using things

1119
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,040
like al exa I won't say her name because

1120
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,290
she's right here

1121
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,840
setting the daily reminders okay lunch

1122
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:17,360
at 12:15 that's actually been a huge

1123
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,310
help to us Dave I know that Netflix has

1124
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,130
long had a work-from-home type of

1125
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:23,870
culture so I'm curious to see how that's

1126
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,550
if this is all old Pat for you or what

1127
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:28,040
changes you experience it's actually

1128
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,600
interesting yeah because we you know our

1129
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,430
culture Dec and the culture memo that

1130
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,900
followed it say you know you can work

1131
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,490
from anywhere and you can work at any

1132
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,780
time but at the end of the day if you've

1133
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,310
got a large company of people you're

1134
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,580
coordinating the best place to

1135
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:42,470
coordinate them is at an office and so

1136
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:44,240
you know some parts of the company will

1137
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:46,549
work from home our entire content

1138
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,859
delivery team has been kind of work from

1139
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,900
home first from day one we recognize

1140
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,090
this is a global internet let's figure

1141
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,260
out you know how to how to leverage the

1142
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:57,180
best talent from around the world

1143
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,560
let them work where they want to work so

1144
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,029
we've actually kind of been instructed

1145
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,830
with the rest of the company like okay

1146
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:05,040
how can how can you scale this how can

1147
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:07,860
you make this work long-term not just

1148
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,960
temporary the big issue though is like

1149
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,250
you know there's the part of the company

1150
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,780
that deals with technology and there's a

1151
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,400
part of the company that makes content

1152
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,680
and it's really hard to fill in a movie

1153
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,720
from at home you do see some things have

1154
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,129
been put together you know on broadcast

1155
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,109
TV you see stuff but even there's a

1156
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,480
couple Netflix shows that have been put

1157
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:26,340
together basically from home but that

1158
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,110
can't continue right we have to get

1159
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,390
production restarted and so even at the

1160
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:32,010
end of the day we're gonna have a lot of

1161
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:33,960
people who can work from home but in the

1162
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,430
same way that you know comcast has

1163
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,770
serviced texts and still have to go to

1164
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:40,440
those homes and just in general they

1165
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,700
have a locale they need to work that you

1166
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,100
know we're gonna have very similar

1167
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,600
problems that we're working with the

1168
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,060
industry to come up with the best

1169
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,279
practices to overcome so that we can get

1170
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,540
back to making content grandma I'm

1171
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,120
curious to see how this has affected

1172
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,520
Google I mean we've long heard that it's

1173
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:59,790
been a flexible work force you're based

1174
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,710
in Zurich what's the work from home work

1175
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:05,970
from office culture change been like for

1176
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:07,290
your company I'd say that we've got a

1177
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,000
good culture of working from home in

1178
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,529
terms of attending any reasons I decided

1179
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,180
I was right with that distributed team

1180
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:14,640
working across timezone says it's true

1181
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:17,220
with many people that requires a certain

1182
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,890
degree of sacrifice it also DeGraw it

1183
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,490
also requires a good degree of

1184
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,770
self-discipline to try to maintain

1185
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:25,200
work/life balance so what we've seen is

1186
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:26,640
as with many technology companies we

1187
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,500
have the really generous carers leave

1188
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,240
allowance made available to us we've

1189
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,440
been encouraging team members to to make

1190
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,399
use of that to make sure that they take

1191
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,440
time for themselves

1192
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,300
and you know it's amazing how to the

1193
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,430
points made gather around and as you

1194
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,810
said by up days getting longer people's

1195
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,910
kind of dutiful nature and their

1196
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,380
professionalism leads them to end up

1197
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,180
working longer in these kind of alien

1198
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,460
surroundings right so it's been really

1199
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,379
important to recognize that and to try

1200
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,530
to set an example and encourage people

1201
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,410
to take that time off so for example I'd

1202
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:57,780
say there being various days in the last

1203
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:59,190
few weeks where I'm taking a half day or

1204
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,840
a full day and then I'll reach out the

1205
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,490
team let them know I am taking that time

1206
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,930
and I'll encourage you to do likewise

1207
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:07,680
just make sure that you do maintain

1208
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,859
their arms absolutely for my part I

1209
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,129
started hosting a tea

1210
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:15,069
show called hashtag wfh work from home

1211
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,210
so I'm liking the work from home culture

1212
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:18,460
and it's certainly been good

1213
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,289
journalistic opportunity and challenge

1214
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,809
for me and taking out new ways to do

1215
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:24,130
things and cheap little USB microphone

1216
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:26,470
cables that has made a huge difference

1217
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:29,950
