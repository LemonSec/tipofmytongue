[Music]

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,239
hi and thank you all again for joining

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:17,310
this discourse Woodfield with the

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,990
program committee one reminder is that

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,840
we're going to have or the feather

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,240
session immediately after this talk the

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,929
links to the zoom links those sessions I

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,089
believe are in the agenda if there are

11
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,560
elsewhere I will make sure to put that

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,170
into the chat

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,379
I haven't going to be introducing yob

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,269
Snider's who's going to be discussing

15
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:42,930
West and learn the use of rpki

16
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:46,230
improving routing yo've is a IP develop

17
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:50,489
an engineer with NTT a large national IP

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:54,148
network and worked on MTTs rpki

19
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:57,510
implementation so with that thank you

20
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:01,530
Europe and you have a mic thank you

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,050
Chris I'm job Snider's I'm based in the

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,130
Netherlands working for NPT spending in

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:12,360
my garden wearing my rpki wooden clocks

24
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:15,210
because safety first and today I want to

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,820
talk a little bit about what NPT

26
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,639
went through to get to the point where

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,520
we could deploy our PTI what the key

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,340
points were that I want to share with

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,949
others as you start to go through this

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,340
process what to look out for how to help

31
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,020
your co-workers and what other people in

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,650
the industry are doing and then at the

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,189
end there is Q&A of course so what is

34
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,399
this infinite thing here we have a nice

35
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,158
abstract image where a graph 3d graphics

36
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,100
generated by looking at all ipv4 and

37
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,850
ipv6 adjacencies that can be observed

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,210
from MVP's perspective and beautiful

39
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,548
image that this is not the real thing

40
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:02,789
this is the real thing my friend mark

41
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:06,329
based in South Africa health built an

42
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,200
isp for the sole purpose so he could

43
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:14,070
stream music and video from his deck

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:16,709
from his garden and this is the internet

45
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:20,160
I would like us to protect that we have

46
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:23,340
a secure communication channel from a

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,840
rousing perspective that packets arrive

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:31,050
right place the bgp protocol is what we

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,290
used to wire all this together there are

50
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,330
many paths maybe you use MCPS in

51
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,519
upstream maybe others maybe if direct

52
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:43,560
peering all of this is glued together

53
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:46,560
with BGP and this BGP thing we call it

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,709
the default free zone it's sort of a

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,560
natural resource it's like the Rhine

56
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:56,640
River that starts in Switzerland goes

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:00,269
for Germany and Belgium finally the

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,760
Netherlands it's very curious how we

59
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,290
have to govern such a natural resource

60
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,910
that's kind of sprout of the ground and

61
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,859
it's distributed through a bunch of

62
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,810
countries because if one of those

63
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,510
countries would start polluting the

64
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,170
river to get rid of say toxic waste or

65
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,849
something else

66
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:23,399
everybody downstream suffers and I see

67
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:26,369
in this a strong analogy to to how we

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,739
could view the default free zone as a

69
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,700
shared resource for which we have to

70
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,319
care together and if something happens

71
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:39,420
in one part of it it can negatively

72
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:41,488
affect many other parts so a simple

73
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,649
problem scenario imagine you as a

74
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,930
network and you connect to a bunch of

75
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,980
peers to reach the rest of their network

76
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,349
and then at the end of the s pass you

77
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,858
see you see multiple paths to a single

78
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:58,700
prefix but you see through network a as

79
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:02,400
a region and network B as an origin

80
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,888
which of these is the actual proper

81
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,639
destination to reach that specific set

82
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:12,239
of IP addresses from BGP itself we

83
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,419
cannot conclude anything so we have to

84
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,459
look to other sources but this scenario

85
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,220
this is the simplest scenario that we

86
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,700
have and this represents the problems we

87
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:28,289
have with BGP optimizers with typos with

88
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:32,630
router defects with you name it this is

89
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:37,030
the core problem so what have we done so

90
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:40,690
far to protect ourselves in NCP we

91
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,640
use routing policies we carefully pack

92
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:46,240
each and every wealth we receive with

93
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,090
beach communities to later on on the

94
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,650
egress site ensure that we are

95
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,130
propagating the right routes to the

96
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:57,099
right peers we use maximum prefix limits

97
00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:00,430
to mitigate the negative fallout from

98
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,520
pool table weeks there's a SPF filtering

99
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:07,960
on every HP session in the shape of pure

100
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,690
lock we've had IR around for for many

101
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,539
years decades we use this to create what

102
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,580
we call allow lists if the prefix is not

103
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:20,050
on the allowance we will not accept it

104
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:24,750
and now on top of all of this we also

105
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:28,870
have rpki based DGP origins elevation

106
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:32,530
what is a PGI in a nutshell

107
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:36,160
it is a very official looking document

108
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:39,280
official Ralf origin authorization for

109
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,710
immediate distribution henceforth only

110
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,599
job Snyder's is authorized to originate

111
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:49,780
IP prefix blah blah blah find MPT as

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,290
certified by Aaron and this document

113
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,630
this this we call it RPI robust this is

114
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,930
the foundation of how we can do original

115
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:01,770
edition and this document is

116
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:05,260
cryptographically for a viable it's

117
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:07,090
machine readable and it has slightly

118
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,870
different semantics than for instance

119
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,729
IRR or letters of agency it is it is a

120
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,280
far more trustworthy source of

121
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:18,310
information and we can apply this

122
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:23,770
information in near real time in our

123
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:27,550
routing decisions so how do you start

124
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:30,070
with our PJ it's easy you go to the NIR

125
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,800
or re herb that manages your IP space

126
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,990
you ask them how can entry it row us

127
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,870
they'll point you to a website or portal

128
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,780
or a different mechanism and off you go

129
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,390
creating robust it's tedious

130
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:47,008
administrative work but all in all it's

131
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:50,919
fairly easy once you get the hang of it

132
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:54,160
other technical components if we view

133
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,810
the RPG I supply chain from the top of

134
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,490
the screen to the bottom half of the

135
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:02,680
screen it is from the five areas that we

136
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:05,410
derive all trust they are called the

137
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,229
trust anchors and these trust anchors

138
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,949
they operate the certificate authorities

139
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:16,680
that further down that are used to

140
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:21,280
certify further delegations in how we

141
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:24,039
made our IP hierarchy so these are ers

142
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,169
publish ro us through some technology

143
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:29,860
and then you have all kinds of providers

144
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:32,530
that pull this information into their

145
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,610
administrative domain so you have M TPT

146
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:40,239
Lea GPT they contact the AR AR AR PK

147
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,909
infrastructure to fetch the RPG I data

148
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,449
house but at this point those files are

149
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:49,210
binary liverish they're not human

150
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,130
readable you need special software to do

151
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,750
anything with it

152
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,960
and this is where the RPK cache

153
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,090
validators come in stuff like OpenBSD RP

154
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,150
carry clients return a tour fork there

155
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:04,869
there are many excellent open-source

156
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:08,789
implementations of the RPG i - and these

157
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:13,900
pieces of software take that binary

158
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:19,090
encrypted data sine theta3 and they

159
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:22,090
validate whether the substation chain is

160
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:25,210
correct now at the end of this process

161
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,190
it takes maybe one or two minutes to go

162
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:31,780
through the whole database and create

163
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:33,490
something that is usable the decoded

164
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,348
information that validated information

165
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:40,419
that contains those RPG I realize that

166
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:43,089
official document has to be shipped to

167
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:46,120
the routers for application in real time

168
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:48,430
in the routing policies so from the RPG

169
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,060
I Cline route inator for style

170
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:55,060
constructs we jump with RTR to our ebgp

171
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,640
routers to Cisco Nokia juniper open

172
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,029
Beach PD and from there we can do really

173
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,029
cool stuff

174
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,020
how do you even get to this point if you

175
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:12,130
are to kick off an RPG I projects or

176
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,030
good for the infinite project where you

177
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,939
would start

178
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:19,240
my recommendation is very simple you get

179
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,150
some servers and you install a RPG I

180
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,840
cache that's the absolute starting point

181
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:29,199
to - this whole process once you have

182
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:32,710
these servers you need to integrate them

183
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,460
with your organization at monitoring set

184
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,610
up our TR sessions - the routers figure

185
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,040
out how this fits in your organization

186
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,650
take a real hard look at your routing

187
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,860
policies to see the exact optimal point

188
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:51,490
to insert the RPG I related routing

189
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:54,070
policies figure out where you can and

190
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:57,160
where you cannot enable rpki in your

191
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:00,730
network especially the larger networks

192
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,100
that have global operations they often

193
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:07,090
carry multiple generations of devices

194
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:11,950
there may be technical or other types of

195
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:14,170
constraints on what is in the few and I

196
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,000
think in most networks there there will

197
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,910
be some devices somewhere where you

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,040
simply cannot deploy rpki that's fine

199
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,760
you make a note this is where we can do

200
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,490
RPI this is where we cannot do RPG I

201
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,890
write documentation make the

202
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,550
documentation in such shape that you can

203
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:36,010
take a free to 12 month vacation this

204
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,770
will help your colleagues and that hooks

205
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:42,340
into training your staff because

206
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:46,449
nowadays even if you do not deploy rpki

207
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,490
you have to add rpki related debugging

208
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,340
steps or troubleshooting steps to your

209
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,560
process because even though you may not

210
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,810
have employed original edition in your

211
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,329
network it could be that other peers or

212
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,079
other providers have deployed our PGI

213
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:03,340
and that may or may not impact

214
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:08,850
communication from your network to a

215
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:12,520
network for which our PK r OS exists and

216
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,690
do not forget to inform your sales team

217
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,850
your marketing

218
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,980
because everybody is excited about this

219
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,680
customers are asking what's the status

220
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:25,510
on our PK and make sure everybody has

221
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:29,819
good answers what it looks like when you

222
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:35,020
deploy our PJ in one big swoop

223
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:37,450
what entity did was we we went through

224
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,780
extensive preparation we modeled what

225
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:44,310
would happen if we deployed our PGI we

226
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:48,310
had a lot of confidence in those

227
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:52,300
emulations and this led us to a position

228
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:56,140
where we could do a 1-day Flag Day so to

229
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,359
speak so in the upper left you see the

230
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,370
amount of our PK envelops that at the

231
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,960
time exists that in the default free

232
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:09,600
zone which are most likely the result of

233
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,600
misconfigured growers many operators

234
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,630
sometimes struggle to create robots when

235
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,400
they start announcing more specifics for

236
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,950
traffic engineering purposes for

237
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,880
instance so this the steady state of

238
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,220
5,000 envelops that exists in the

239
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,610
default free zone is a good metric to

240
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,980
understand how far are you in deploying

241
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,710
our PGI in your own network and as you

242
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,880
deploy our PGI our more and more devices

243
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:43,390
the amount of ipv4 or ipv6 envelops

244
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:51,720
should go down in the lower left of the

245
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:56,140
screen you see the connected RTR clients

246
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:59,260
through multi our process we in

247
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,970
increasingly larger batches deployed our

248
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,680
peak area or more and more devices in

249
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,470
the network and I find it really

250
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,079
interesting that it was only in the last

251
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:12,690
few percent of enabling our PGI that we

252
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:15,580
saw the big drop that signals the

253
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:19,870
milestone of what we accomplished on

254
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:23,560
March 26 so this is one way of deploying

255
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:27,550
RPK but there are colleagues in the

256
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:30,099
previous panel covered other approaches

257
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,229
and all these approaches are valid you

258
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,600
you just look what fits with my

259
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:39,459
organization is that Aflac day is it a

260
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:42,459
slower process it's all good so after we

261
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:48,010
deployed a few days later we checked in

262
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:49,869
with the NOC and much to my well not for

263
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,910
my surprise but this was exactly what I

264
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:55,839
hoped for that it would be largely

265
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:58,360
unnoticed some customers dialed in for

266
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,380
the NARC asking what is this RPG Ising

267
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,019
you're even talking about

268
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,930
and these are great questions to be

269
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:10,570
answering when you have deployed RPG and

270
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:12,790
are looking for the real issues so we

271
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,430
started the I will now cover the

272
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,860
specifics of the NTP deployment this is

273
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,719
a template that you can follow but

274
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,120
there's many other software's and many

275
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,040
other approaches to structure origin

276
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,220
salad ation in your network but this is

277
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:30,130
what we did we started with setting up

278
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:34,329
some servers these servers use openly is

279
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:37,839
these are PGI client and through the go

280
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:40,630
RTR software we distribute the VR piece

281
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,020
the validate that robot payloads from

282
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,750
the validators to the RTR servers in our

283
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:53,800
deployment validators and RTR servers

284
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:56,079
are separate tiers we did extensive lab

285
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,760
testing on all kinds of gear that we

286
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,149
have in the Wow

287
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,980
but in our lab and some interesting

288
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:06,089
things were found vendors were

289
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:10,810
approached they were fixed and quick

290
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:12,490
another thing that we did is you may

291
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,069
remember from a little bit more than a

292
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:18,490
year ago that we worked to integrate our

293
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:22,600
PK reagent validation in the PM HDCP

294
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:25,390
software shout-out to Paulo PMA CCP is a

295
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,420
traffic analyzer that can correlate flow

296
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:31,269
data BGP data and also arbitrary data

297
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,790
and this means that you can carefully

298
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:36,430
inspect what exactly will happen

299
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,860
should you deploy our PGI and what the

300
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,979
impact on your traffic is and we also

301
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,370
use this tool

302
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,800
to approach a small subset of customers

303
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:49,370
where we sense that if we work to deploy

304
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:53,390
our pique their robots were not

305
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:55,010
optimally configured and and this helped

306
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,170
us a lot to get to the point where

307
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:01,250
everybody in the organization felt

308
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:03,260
comfortable enough to give the green

309
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,530
light

310
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,810
as mentioned before in the panel we we

311
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:12,500
did find some bugs and fortunately

312
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:16,489
enough most of those are cosmetic in

313
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,560
nature so RPK it's a new technology it's

314
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,080
receiving more and more exposure this is

315
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,849
cool this helps us understand the

316
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,600
robustness or the weak points of the

317
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:31,090
system and as we go we look at those and

318
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:34,400
try to improve and at the end of it we

319
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:37,400
we had a single flag day but again this

320
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,220
is not something that everybody must

321
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:44,360
follow follow a process that is fitting

322
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:48,020
for your organization rpki

323
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:51,170
is a emergent industry trend and this

324
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:56,090
means that over time looking at wealth

325
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:58,699
huge risks or NL marks lookingglass we

326
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:01,570
can see that more and more networks are

327
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:05,380
no longer propagating RPGs for are

328
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:08,750
propagating substantially less envelops

329
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:12,680
than they were before and I try to

330
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,740
pinpoint what was observed in the raw

331
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:18,050
BGP data to my personal notes and

332
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,260
Twitter feed on who did what where and

333
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:23,690
we ended up with this awesome image that

334
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,609
shows that this is a industry-wide

335
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:28,220
project I don't think we've seen

336
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:34,060
anything of this skill in recent years

337
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:36,980
so kudos at present

338
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:39,980
roughly two and half thousand eponymous

339
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,350
system numbers from entities perspective

340
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:46,400
so this is our view on the default

341
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:49,730
frieszo appear to be protected or to

342
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,140
benefit in some way from rpki origin

343
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:55,920
validation and

344
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:58,170
number I it's not real science I mean

345
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,270
there's lots of caveats that could be

346
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,679
default routes there could be

347
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,770
intermediate networks and then stuff

348
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,690
networks that are not doing RPG Ibis

349
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:10,020
because the intermediate network is

350
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:12,150
doing RPG I'd shows up in this test but

351
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,370
to me given that they're roughly

352
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,470
70-thousand afms in the default free

353
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,169
zone and we are now already seeing

354
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,820
effects for thousands of agents and they

355
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,210
will depend on your view on the D for

356
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,580
freezer

357
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:31,380
how many exactly this is really good

358
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:33,870
uptake of this technology 20% of IP

359
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:38,780
space appears to be covered by robust

360
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:43,649
and we found that this number is

361
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:47,760
proportionally in how traffic flows for

362
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:49,980
a network so it's not one-to-one but a

363
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,799
substantial amount of traffic in

364
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:57,450
entities network flows to RPGs elif

365
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,510
destinations and those destinations now

366
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:09,059
receive the benefits from us rejecting

367
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:12,179
envelops in the RPG I'm there are a few

368
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:14,070
what I call fill positions that we have

369
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:17,549
to take into consideration and these

370
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:20,159
fill positions are the key to how the

371
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:22,889
industry was able to implement and

372
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,010
deploy RPI in an incremental fashion as

373
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:28,740
I mentioned before are not every router

374
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:32,940
in entities network RPI is enabled and

375
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:36,419
this is not an issue because the the

376
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:40,200
piece is where we could enable our PTI

377
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:42,690
are so large compared to the part where

378
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,870
we cannot net do that that we are

379
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,120
receiving for more than 95% of our in

380
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:51,418
bgp sessions the projection of origins

381
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,570
elevation so there's incremental

382
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:57,210
deployment how does that work

383
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:59,520
RPI is a opportunistic security layer it

384
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,919
is optional it is opt-in if you don't

385
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,900
want to create robots don't if you don't

386
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,030
want to create a deploy original

387
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:12,920
foundation you don't need to nobody

388
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:17,010
can force you so in this process the

389
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,350
foundational cornerstone for doing rich

390
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,840
in validation and letting data flow in a

391
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,659
same way through the rpki supply chain

392
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,550
it is very important that the starting

393
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:32,970
point of the process is trustworthy and

394
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:35,909
this means that if there is an issue in

395
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:39,440
the cryptography it should never affect

396
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:42,960
the bgp routing an issue in the

397
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,390
cryptography should result in that no

398
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,760
fear please come into existence which

399
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:51,590
means that the routes that could have

400
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:57,180
been covered by those broken rollers or

401
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:59,280
expired Rojas will flip to not found the

402
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:02,490
expectation of this industry is that any

403
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:06,210
issue in the RPG infrastructure itself

404
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:08,790
will be reflected as not found in the

405
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:13,200
beach Pierrot so invalid cryptographic

406
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:16,260
data does not make it to the beach pier

407
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,200
outers and therefore all those routes

408
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:25,170
that could have been covered if the role

409
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:29,220
of us ballast are not found and this is

410
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:31,110
a fill safe mechanism and it's kind of

411
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,330
weird to think about it so if it's

412
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,310
invalid here it comes not found there if

413
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,990
it's valid here it could potentially

414
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,210
become valid there and if it's valid

415
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:43,470
here the beach key routes may become

416
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:46,440
invalid and this is this this takes some

417
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,120
training it's a fun exercise and I hope

418
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,790
that this slide helps a little bit in

419
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,949
that regard

420
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:55,290
what about timing how quick does this

421
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,840
RPI stuff propagate through the internet

422
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:01,470
what can we expect and I think a lot of

423
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:05,610
us are accustomed to how the IRA runs on

424
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:09,420
say a 24-hour cycle a lower based system

425
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:13,590
runs on whenever the human opens up the

426
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:15,900
photoshopped PDF but with our PK the

427
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,990
expectation that that we're trying to

428
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,270
shape is that if you create robust

429
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:25,640
that you will see the effects in a

430
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,639
global internet in an hour

431
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,260
laters

432
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:34,428
for then once an hour don't make our PK

433
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:37,650
a 24-hour cycle process it needs to run

434
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:39,860
faster it needs to run say every 30

435
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,860
minutes

436
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:46,110
how are cool things we can do with our

437
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,390
PGI things that are either already done

438
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:52,740
or are now in motion and to be released

439
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:56,309
later in 2020 in the ripe region there

440
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,500
used to be one ir database and the right

441
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:01,230
database was a bit complex because that

442
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,450
one database contains both afford to

443
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,300
information and nama fortify our

444
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,860
information a project was kicked off in

445
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,470
the right community to split this out

446
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,689
into a massive source and a nama for

447
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,809
that source but the number for that

448
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,300
source we don't know what the intentions

449
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:22,460
were of the people that at the time and

450
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,750
they could perhaps the 10 15 years ago

451
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,429
we're trying to accomplish and whether

452
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,370
that information is still relevant

453
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:32,850
cleaning up such IRR databases is really

454
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:36,959
hard if you cannot contact every owner

455
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:39,629
in a streamlined fashion no but what we

456
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,660
do know is that our PK is a higher

457
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:47,280
source of truth than the IRR with the

458
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:50,580
RPG I prove the chain of trust that is

459
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:55,020
supported by the x.509 technology and

460
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:57,330
RPG on top of that we have strong

461
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:00,210
assurances that we are looking at the

462
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:03,210
actual routing intentions of the

463
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:08,340
resource holder so if we encounter in

464
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:10,830
the Nama fortify our database a object

465
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:14,340
that is in conflict with a published RPI

466
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,889
Roya you can delete that ir object

467
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,530
because that IRR object is describing a

468
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:22,080
situation that cannot exist in bgp if

469
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,660
you apply origin validation on your

470
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,110
edges so that's one clean a project

471
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:31,250
that's a motion and now as people create

472
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:32,939
robots for space we slowly see the

473
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,210
amount of

474
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:40,620
nation in this nama Fortis database

475
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:45,120
dropdown a second effort related to this

476
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:47,790
is entities open-source IRR D this is an

477
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,750
infinite routing registry daemon that

478
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:54,570
you can use either to cache the various

479
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:58,290
IRR sources or to be an effort that I or

480
00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:02,310
source yourself afford this is well

481
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:05,490
within the context of IRB and what we're

482
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:09,179
doing in this in the next release we are

483
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:11,370
making the IRD aware of what exists in

484
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:14,100
our PTI and then we can use that

485
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:16,820
information to struck everything that

486
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:19,379
goes through the IRD and only output

487
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:22,260
information that is not in conflict with

488
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,090
published our Kairos and I think this is

489
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,120
the transitional path for our industry

490
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,919
more and more people create robots more

491
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,300
and more ir information that is in

492
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,150
conflict with those robots will

493
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,760
disappear from the ir ecosystem and i

494
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:38,130
think this is a nice gentle way to move

495
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,810
us forward and it puts the incentives

496
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:43,710
exactly where they should be

497
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:47,250
with the resource holders that they that

498
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,990
create the robots so you can click this

499
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:52,470
links for more information if you

500
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,330
download the slide deck later a study

501
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:58,140
resource that as I mentioned a few times

502
00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:02,010
but it cannot receive enough trace group

503
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:04,560
work Alex bands and your team rpki read

504
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,960
the docs table IO I consider this a

505
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,050
community-driven documentation project

506
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,300
that is the go-to resource for anybody

507
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,710
that needs to learn about the RPG I if

508
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,110
you need to start somewhere

509
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:19,410
this is it this is easy to read

510
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:21,320
documentation that has lots of cool info

511
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:26,310
on what works what doesn't work what are

512
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:29,310
becoming the BC piece etc if you're more

513
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:32,159
hardcore there is the ITF RC

514
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:35,639
specifications contain all the

515
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:38,550
nitty-gritty of how the RPI works some

516
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,250
of these are quite lengthy and can be

517
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,379
hard to understand if you're not writing

518
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,670
an implementation at the same time but

519
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,690
some of them are actually really

520
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,240
readable documents that are only a

521
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,790
you pages and describe what exactly it

522
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,570
is that your relative will be doing one

523
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:57,960
of those is our c68 one one and that is

524
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:00,970
the beach be origin validation are see

525
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,920
if you ignore the boilerplate and and

526
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,830
the stuff at the end it's two or three

527
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,010
pages I recommend everybody to read that

528
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:11,409
document

529
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:15,670
thus rpki solve all infinite routing

530
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:17,890
problems no and there will never be a

531
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,380
silver bullet that's simply not how the

532
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,110
internet works

533
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,900
there are many initiatives underway to

534
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:28,510
improve the RPI and improve the

535
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,940
functionality of the RPI these

536
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:34,690
collaborations happen in open standards

537
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:37,390
bodies like the IETF based on open

538
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:41,860
source software this is where we work to

539
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:44,260
keep honing rpki to be not an ugly pig

540
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:50,379
that we made fly but something we love

541
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:54,070
and enjoy using my request to you as

542
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,510
network operators please create our PK

543
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,230
robots for your internet number

544
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:02,050
resources if you create a rola entity

545
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:05,350
will use it and this is good news

546
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:08,050
because it gives you immediate firm

547
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:11,199
control they put agency in your hands

548
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:15,669
about how well thing happens in ntp for

549
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,440
your number resources and secondly work

550
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:21,580
to deploy our PGI based

551
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,490
origin validation on ebgp sessions in

552
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:27,460
such a way that you reject invalid

553
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,650
announcements and this means apply our

554
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,450
PK on your transit connections and

555
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,550
appearing connections on your customer

556
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:35,200
phase and connections on route server

557
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:38,050
facing connections on the route service

558
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,470
themselves the cool thing with our PK

559
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:45,190
compared to the ir the RP Kari has five

560
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:47,650
trust anchors whereas IR had all kinds

561
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,450
of ASIS and nobody knew what is the

562
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:52,000
complete set of databases that we need

563
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,820
to take into consideration this left the

564
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,250
thing open-ended which in effect meant

565
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,260
that you could not apply IR based

566
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,280
filtering on your transit phasing

567
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,400
sessions

568
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,850
but with RPK that issue does not exist

569
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,770
we know that the five trust anchors

570
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,780
provide us with a complete set of the

571
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:13,570
space under our ers governance and

572
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:17,710
therefore it is possible to apply our

573
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:19,870
PTI on every ebgp session if you're

574
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,000
looking for more information network

575
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:24,850
information centers such as the internet

576
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,450
registries like Aaron are a great place

577
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:31,800
to go and find more study material and

578
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:34,240
find the tools to to create robots

579
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,230
Manners has a bunch of information on

580
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,140
this

581
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:41,800
there's the RPK mailing list hosted by

582
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:44,380
an element labs where operators zoom in

583
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,659
on specifically our PGI complex of

584
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,720
compatibility issues or interoperability

585
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,090
issues or whatnot if you ever have any

586
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,920
question about our PK this is a great

587
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,790
mailing list with people that are

588
00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:01,090
dedicated to help you and finally there

589
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:02,409
is also an IRC channel good ol IRC the

590
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,040
thing on which we are building this

591
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:09,100
infinite the pound IX IRC channel is a

592
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,470
good place to to real-time communication

593
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,020
with fellow Internet operators if you

594
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,180
have questions about our PGI or bgp

595
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,260
routing in general so here you have a

596
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:29,440
bunch of different places where you can

597
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:30,820
go to fight more and that's it if this

598
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,250
brings me to the end of my presentation

599
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,500
and it seems that I ran over by two or

600
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,780
three minutes

601
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:41,080
thanks Europe doesn't look like we have

602
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:45,430
any questions in the queue so so let's

603
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:48,730
conclude here and reminder the BOF birds

604
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:50,410
up other sessions there is a link that

605
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,800
we have dropped in the chat room so feel

606
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:56,550
free to join that with zoom and see you

607
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:59,970
at the vos and thank you very much up

608
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,970
take care everyone

609
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,419
