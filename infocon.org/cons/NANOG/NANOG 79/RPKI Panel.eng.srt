specifically on the rpki and it'll be

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,140
moderated by Mark coster's and I'll let

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,609
panelists today

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,990
great thanks John so I'm Mark Osler some

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,420
CTO there and when it in things that's

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,280
very interesting to me is that Tom Daley

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,519
gave a presentation yesterday first

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,290
keynote talking about new innovative

16
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:42,690
services and one of the things that he

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,390
talked about was our peacock and I was

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,250
really glad to hear that for a couple of

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,010
reasons one is even though this is

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,489
something that y'all are seeing fairly

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,680
recently this is something has been in

22
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,538
been in the works for over a decade so

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,019
this is a work that's been under

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,850
development or has been deployed for a

25
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,060
while and we're starting to see some

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,160
real traction within the community and

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,420
one of the things I like to do with the

28
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,420
panelists here Adam that Davenport CF

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,200
lagerfeld and Nimrod levy is talk about

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,479
how this could be used within your

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,759
enterprise and hopefully when you leave

32
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,189
this panel you say if you haven't been

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,049
doing this already that this is

34
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,630
something that you'll look forward to

35
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:36,960
implement within your own Internet

36
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,970
service provider so I'm going to go to

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,100
the next slide what I like to show you

38
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,450
here is oops is is that you can see over

39
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,220
time that we're starting to see

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:53,219
accelerated growth on on our number of

41
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,899
people who are using our PGI within the

42
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,490
Arin region and it's not true just

43
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,869
within the Arin region but this is

44
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,649
internationally with the other four

45
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:05,490
regional registries as well and when it

46
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,710
things I'll note a note here is very

47
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,008
recently we started to see a lot more

48
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,859
traffic with delegated using up/down so

49
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,149
this is a is because of new technology

50
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,239
that's come out that's made it fairly

51
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,100
easy for people to use most people are

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,770
still using hosted solutions which

53
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,840
majority of our customers are using and

54
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,380
talk about that more with the panelists

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,600
about which solution that they've used

56
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,220
and so that you can see as you go

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:39,150
forward what you should think you should

58
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:42,890
do here's the panelist bring the faces

59
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:46,880
to the names Adam CF and Nimrod and

60
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:51,600
working for GGT tell carrier and ATT

61
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,370
respectively and here's our agenda so

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,350
each of the panelists is going to talk

63
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,270
about the current state of our PK within

64
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,549
their networks and then we're going to

65
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,080
go through a question session where each

66
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,300
of the panelists is going to be question

67
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,280
asked questions about their planning and

68
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,390
implementation at planning and testing

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,470
say stages their implementation stage as

70
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,149
well as future phases and if we have

71
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,370
time afterwards we'll open it up for

72
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:23,280
questions so let's go ahead and start

73
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,920
the the panelists so the first question

74
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,540
I'm wondering we'll start with you Adam

75
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,190
if you could tell us a little bit about

76
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:35,519
the stave your rpki implementation sure

77
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:38,040
probably four to six weeks ago we rolled

78
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,890
out the final phase of our validation

79
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,560
deployments so we are now dropping in

80
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:49,339
ballots essentially at all quarters so

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:53,160
peers and customers great great and UCF

82
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,590
well we start our journey by mid-2008

83
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,859
inna tell ya and we finalized our

84
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,750
deployment by last night on beginning of

85
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,050
February this year by dropping both from

86
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:08,459
customers and peers excellent excellent

87
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:12,150
and you Nimrod so we've been dropping in

88
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,520
ballots on our peering edge since for

89
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:19,640
about almost a year and a half now since

90
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:23,130
this prior to that our last February and

91
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:26,070
we're working on some some solutions to

92
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,990
filter routes that we learn from our

93
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,460
customers they're not filtering directly

94
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:34,880
dropping a balance on our house

95
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:39,289
correctly are you playing to do so

96
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:43,130
um we're planning on we're looking at

97
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:45,400
some some interview solutions where we

98
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:51,560
the affection will be that there will be

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:53,900
we won't be propagating in ballots I

100
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,480
don't know that we're going to get in

101
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,400
your turn on where we're going to be

102
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,400
directing filtering on on everything

103
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,940
okay great great

104
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,370
so let's not talk about the planning and

105
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,350
implementation that you had to do to

106
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,030
make this all happen and the first

107
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,670
question I like you to ask you guys is

108
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,979
how did you make art became a priority

109
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:19,040
within your organization and what was

110
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,320
the business case to do so um so Adam

111
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,170
let's start with you sir

112
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,420
we began seeing our ki KI asked about in

113
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,790
customer rfp's probably starting around

114
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,990
two years ago within the last year

115
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,450
though we've started seeing it become a

116
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,930
requirement and those are Effie's versus

117
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:39,050
a would be nice additionally we've had

118
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,870
multiple existing customers experience

119
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,030
what I'll call unauthorized announcement

120
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,340
events and definitely call us direct

121
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,739
impacts to their operations so they were

122
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,510
calling forward as well and given kind

123
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:56,360
of those factors it was pretty easy to

124
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:58,969
justify internally okay CF well I agree

125
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,470
with Adam we thought about the same time

126
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,460
frame they started popping up in

127
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,180
customer

128
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,890
discussions in 2018 but also with the

129
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,010
number of PT behind X at a large scale

130
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:12,650
not declining the opposite really we saw

131
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:16,610
more often hijack that - down typer

132
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,200
scales and others so we started a

133
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,900
project that Telia which was good for

134
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,990
the internet where we saw bi and also

135
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,969
joining manners steps to at least do our

136
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,600
part in helping and make sure that then

137
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:33,020
that gets better and safer okay okay

138
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,960
Nimrod in how about you so our path was

139
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:38,150
a little bit different than I think we

140
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:43,070
started earlier Mike Connolly J Griffin

141
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:47,210
Hagen has been very active in the groups

142
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,790
where the vendors are bellum and so he's

143
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,349
been asked

144
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:55,680
in that noun for quite some time and so

145
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,020
we were we kind of pushed it

146
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,770
you're from from a few man hold

147
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:07,859
individuals really internally drove that

148
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:11,640
to to make it important ready

149
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,750
employed I'm not aware that may have

150
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,150
come from some customers

151
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,150
what's it well but I'm not aware of that

152
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,680
okay great I think it's kind of

153
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,989
fascinating from Adams perspective that

154
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,380
there are piece that came out saying you

155
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,960
need to have RPG I I'm wondering if

156
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,790
that's going to become more of a trend

157
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,000
as we go forward what you guys think

158
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,250
about that

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,040
what do you think well we already

160
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:46,290
started seeing it especially after well

161
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,600
the press releases I last year so yeah

162
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:51,350
almost all of the bigger customers they

163
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,120
are requiring it or requiring the

164
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,030
attendee to have a timeline for

165
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,100
implementing it we're kind of

166
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,469
interesting the Nimrod I take it you two

167
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,470
have also have seen that or maybe I've

168
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:08,220
heard about it so I'm not really in tune

169
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:12,750
with the requirements coming in but I do

170
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:15,270
I think that that's a motivator for for

171
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:19,560
all of us to do a lot of things this is

172
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,810
what our customers want so doing and so

173
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,820
you know it's these are things that are

174
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:28,950
really positive or they internet adult

175
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:31,800
should be doing okay great great

176
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,229
so when you were going through this and

177
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,760
he said okay gonna set up our PK I'm

178
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:38,610
sure that you all put these things in

179
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,620
your labs and actually trying to make

180
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,990
this stuff work what sort of steps did

181
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,460
you do to make sure that you when you

182
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,960
were going to deploy the site you felt

183
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,150
like hey this is gonna work out and just

184
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,670
go or cotton pretty a pretty good way I

185
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,160
don't let's start out with you yeah sure

186
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,380
yeah we definitely deployed in the lab

187
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,540
setup initially you can only get so far

188
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,600
in a lab environment though so for

189
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,610
are you know kinda live test we

190
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,930
identified five different boxes that

191
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,120
were can all over the place in our

192
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:10,030
network different models etc and

193
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,330
basically deployed full validation on

194
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:16,480
those five devices to see you know what

195
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:18,280
you know if any issues would arise and

196
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,780
you're probably not a super exciting

197
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,220
answer but honestly speaking there

198
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,069
weren't any real issues with catch it

199
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,260
did pop up as part of this and things

200
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,590
went pretty well as expected so we

201
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:34,390
didn't really have any surprises there

202
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:37,330
okay in Carl and what about you well we

203
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:40,330
started actually rolling at also going

204
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,920
by device type or software type and

205
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,200
checking okay so how does it handle

206
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,390
their two-hour sessions and checking

207
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,810
that it does an impact and we started by

208
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:52,060
marking all the received routes with a

209
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:55,060
community depending on foundation state

210
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,680
this made us so we could track that in

211
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,670
an SLO data and see how much traffic do

212
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,010
you really have towards these

213
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,400
destinations that are invalid prior to

214
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:06,189
us making any decision and that helped

215
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:10,060
us well we've seen a lot of small tiny

216
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,830
bugs but we all work around the bug that

217
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,560
we have from day to day so as long as

218
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:18,040
you're aware of them it's quite easy to

219
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,500
actually implement this okay Nimrod what

220
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,560
about you yeah we did a lot of the same

221
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,830
things I mean so we we did our

222
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,709
deployment I think earlier then then a

223
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:33,790
lot of the larger networks so we didn't

224
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:38,890
have as much history of other folks to

225
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:41,170
be able to to play off of and so we did

226
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,530
exactly what uh what carl fredrik

227
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:47,589
mentioned there is that we had our you

228
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:50,170
know relying Hardeen software in place

229
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,210
for a long time we actually had the

230
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,360
session put up through the routers

231
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:58,780
without doing any actual filtering but

232
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,410
we had that in place from I guess was

233
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:06,280
like October of 2018

234
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:08,469
before that previous nano and and so we

235
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,569
were tagging routes and and monitoring

236
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,860
traffic and really trying to evaluate

237
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,680
what the in

238
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,720
actually we already done our lab tests

239
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,000
to make sure that that we didn't see

240
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,490
didn't expect any problems with the

241
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,490
routers and the technology itself it was

242
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:27,209
really more of what is this policy going

243
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:30,760
to do to real-life traffic at that point

244
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:34,510
but you know it's your standard test and

245
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:38,140
review and and intended rate and then

246
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,850
white kind of a process great

247
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,260
so min round if you could just get a

248
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,970
little bit close to the mic that would

249
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:48,040
be useful so I'm wondering it did any of

250
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,440
you all have any surprises when you went

251
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,740
from the lab environment to production

252
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,730
or D was it just a really smooth rollout

253
00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:00,430
and if there was any gotchas are you

254
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:03,490
willing to share any of the gotchas so

255
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,500
Adam let's start with you sure I would

256
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,170
say for the most part it was pretty

257
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,540
straightforward we did have one kind of

258
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,380
minor blip I would say you know our

259
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:16,589
particular vendor has an open bug that's

260
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:20,100
rpki related and certain certain

261
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:23,829
scenarios ops a really disconcerting

262
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,600
message in the logs type thing but upon

263
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:28,029
further inspection this is largely

264
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,980
cosmetic and not a real issue so

265
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,260
basically that was pretty much the only

266
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,760
thing that we had pop up and again it

267
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,240
ended up being more cosmetic than

268
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,620
anything and not impacted and impacting

269
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,149
excellently in current what about you

270
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,149
we've only had one boat that has been

271
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:47,920
serviced impacting for a very few

272
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:51,220
customers and it was with one vendor

273
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,959
related to brows Anthony when there was

274
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,100
a delta update received from one of the

275
00:12:52,959 --> 00:13:00,518
RTR caches the router was connected to

276
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:04,209
that is sold in releases that are

277
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:08,290
popular by now but nothing more than

278
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:10,420
those tiny things in the Murad you I

279
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,149
don't think we saw any significant

280
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,370
vendor bugs there are things that that

281
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:16,829
we have to work around like we said you

282
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,269
know as long as you know those things

283
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:21,520
going in you can usually work around

284
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:23,529
them and I don't think we've seen

285
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,629
anything significant the thing that I

286
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:28,959
think surprised me the most

287
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:31,509
was the volume of traffic him impacted

288
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,199
when we were doing our measurements the

289
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:39,009
amount of traffic that's associated with

290
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:42,459
these invalid prefixes was so small that

291
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:46,629
that was really surprising hmm

292
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:48,248
okay okay interesting okay so this sort

293
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:50,379
of brings up the sort of next question

294
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:53,799
in terms of we sort of moved on into the

295
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:55,420
implementation phase so when you were

296
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,069
doing this I there's a lot of people

297
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,429
have fears and say hey this is gonna bog

298
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:03,009
down my routers if I have to do this I

299
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:04,689
know I'm going to make mistakes or

300
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:08,079
something's going to happen which is

301
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:10,420
going to impact my customers did you see

302
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,599
any performance or operational impact

303
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:18,790
with when or origination validation was

304
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,709
configured in on your routers and were

305
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,809
you concerned about that when you rolled

306
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:25,329
these things out and what is your advice

307
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:28,480
to others as they go through this

308
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:30,609
deployment scheme Adam let's start with

309
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,429
you sure I mean it was definitely a

310
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:36,850
concern you know we didn't see kind of

311
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:38,980
any impact performance wise in our lab

312
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,299
testing and then we you know test

313
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,269
started testing in production on those

314
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:45,699
five devices that was beer we didn't

315
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:47,139
really see you know anything there

316
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:50,559
either and we monitored pretty

317
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:52,480
extensively for 3-4 weeks before looking

318
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,149
to you know kind of continue rolling out

319
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,910
our deployment but by and large you know

320
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:00,610
we just didn't really notice anything

321
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,110
negatively one way or the other so my

322
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,119
advice would be is you know try it out

323
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,790
make sure things look good on your

324
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:07,959
platform but generally speaking it's you

325
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,139
know the deployment has been pretty

326
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:15,309
pretty smooth and pretty straightforward

327
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:16,959
okay great çf about you and someone is

328
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:23,230
muting me and unmuting me all the time

329
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:24,849
yes that's why I know we also tested

330
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,879
this in lab person we didn't really see

331
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:30,249
any issues what was interesting was this

332
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,589
spring when more and more of our

333
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:34,929
customers started enabling this and we

334
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:37,269
could see some interesting thing on some

335
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:39,280
of our bgp sessions that we know so is

336
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,860
as we tested this for some time we

337
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,970
some of the smaller bugs that are not

338
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,610
something you should care about

339
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,200
if you run up-to-date software but some

340
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,490
of our customers apparently don't do

341
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:54,130
that and what we can see there is a lot

342
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:57,790
more route refresh being received on VDP

343
00:15:54,130 --> 00:16:02,020
sessions actually consuming a fair bit

344
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:05,550
of CPU usage on our routers but so far

345
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,720
we've been able to cope with that yeah

346
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:15,640
ok ok excellent

347
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:17,980
Nimrod what about you um so obviously we

348
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,050
were concerned about performance when

349
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,390
when we tested we didn't see anything in

350
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,969
the lab and and we still don't see

351
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:28,030
anything concerning in production I'll

352
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:31,090
also mention that the Doug Montgomery

353
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:33,160
over at NIST has done some testing on on

354
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,430
some of the sorts of things I'm not sure

355
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,969
if all of this data is published or not

356
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:42,849
but you've done some work where they

357
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,570
they tested with you know full tables of

358
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:51,490
rows for everything fully a fully signed

359
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:54,190
table you know a 50 % table 75 % table

360
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:57,339
different combinations of amounts of

361
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:00,790
sign prefixes just to see how it would

362
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:02,920
affect the platforms and any really from

363
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,980
what I understand and had noticed

364
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,688
negligible impact on on that so you know

365
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,569
even as the number of rollers continues

366
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:17,410
bro I don't expect that we're going to

367
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:21,310
see ok excellent excellent

368
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:23,530
um so what rpki a validation software

369
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,079
you are y'all using and how did they

370
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,200
implemented maintained and do you have

371
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,960
redundancy and monitoring configured

372
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:37,290
Adam let's start with you sure we are

373
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:40,930
using four validator and auto and and go

374
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:45,340
basically we've got a free validator set

375
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:49,300
ups you know redundancy was a big

376
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,649
concern of ours so you know we basically

377
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,620
trying to deploy these in a way that was

378
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,470
redundant

379
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,939
in all manners there you know our

380
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,940
validators are in different locations

381
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:02,120
globally they all run different you know

382
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,230
validation software the validation or

383
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,389
the validators are running on different

384
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,520
hardware and different vendors we even

385
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,799
use different operating systems but our

386
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,750
goal with definitely to deploy without a

387
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,389
single point of failure which i think we

388
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,150
did a pretty thorough job of and yes so

389
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,500
far things have been look pretty good

390
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:22,669
absolutely that sounds great what about

391
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,200
UCS sames being area so that was a major

392
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,179
concern for us as well especially what

393
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,010
we saw in testing in the beginning where

394
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:30,529
there were really only the right

395
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:34,879
relators available and the pro rata

396
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:38,779
nature actually got stable but we

397
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,940
decided to not only offer or offer but

398
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:42,740
have validate your stats are of

399
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,120
different types different software but

400
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,130
also spread them out geographically so

401
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,110
all our Raptors connect to all of our

402
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,020
validators spread out over the world

403
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:53,330
which makes a litte bit more redundant I

404
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,210
would say as well and we are running

405
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,789
right now with only RPG elements I'm

406
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,909
from OpenBSD together with go fer for

407
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:04,820
the RTR function and browse nature with

408
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:08,419
included RTR supports we used to run

409
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,970
extract PGI but rolled that back just a

410
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:13,490
month ago one thing that we monitor is

411
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,809
also the output of all of the validator

412
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,090
to make sure that they are in sync with

413
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:19,129
one another because there is some

414
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:22,580
discussion in the community of how you

415
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,500
should interpret our c4 for invalid

416
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,330
certificates and other things that make

417
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,750
the develop aegis on the market actually

418
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,158
output different things as well and in

419
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,960
the comparisons then between the

420
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,210
network's you could say okay but they

421
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,919
think lamented RPG I but for some reason

422
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,350
I see a few invalids well there is a

423
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,570
reason for that

424
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,908
yeah yeah actually you bring up really

425
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,678
good point CF and that is there's there

426
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,700
some things within the standards that

427
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:53,240
need to be as sort of clarify a bit

428
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:56,270
especially with CR ELLs expiry etc that

429
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,399
have seen and is definitely brings up

430
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:01,370
interpretations or things that different

431
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:04,189
vendors have done it's a good point

432
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,998
Nimrod what about you we take the same

433
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,269
approach

434
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:11,179
you know multiple geographic locations

435
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:14,329
multiple vendors of relying party

436
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:17,149
software right now we're we're still

437
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:22,668
running the right degree and as well as

438
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:25,039
route Nader horizon on the west what's

439
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:30,079
coming if it's it's valid to make a

440
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:32,469
change and we also have have some

441
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,688
monitoring in place where we check the

442
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:38,479
what the routers see from those relying

443
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:41,869
party and make sure that we have a

444
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:43,249
consistent view from all of those from

445
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:47,599
every instance of the relying party

446
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:50,329
software some need for any vendors that

447
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,039
might be listening be great to have an

448
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:59,418
easier way to get to lemon tree for that

449
00:20:52,039 --> 00:21:02,239
first no screen scraping oddly great

450
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:04,129
well thank you so much so let's go back

451
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:06,169
let's go to the provisioning site we

452
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:08,869
talked about the validation sites go but

453
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:13,039
on actually great rows within your own

454
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:16,759
networks and which solution are you guys

455
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:20,929
using and which regional registries are

456
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:24,949
you touching and what do you prefer

457
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:27,139
so Adam let's start with you sure you

458
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:29,269
know we've got IP space with you know

459
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:32,869
all the our IRS except maybe lack knit

460
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:35,539
so you know we've we've been creating

461
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:37,309
rows for our space in our own space with

462
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:39,408
each of those right now it's being done

463
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:41,959
manually we admittedly just don't have

464
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:43,639
that much IP address space that's ours

465
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:46,489
you know the originated I think and

466
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:49,099
that's been that's worked out for us I

467
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:50,269
think you know the process there it's

468
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,918
obviously a little bit different between

469
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:54,169
the different are hours but by and large

470
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,029
it's you know not overly complicated or

471
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:58,339
anything like that so it's been pretty

472
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:02,149
straightforward there as well okay so

473
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:05,178
yeah yeah we've gone with the hosted

474
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:06,889
solution have that both right Aaron and

475
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:08,779
APNIC offers right now at least then

476
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:11,718
same thing as I'm weird Tier one we

477
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:14,059
don't ordinate that much IP space we've

478
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:16,249
had a few customers where we have

479
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:18,440
delegated our own IP space to where we

480
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:22,970
had to go through and sort out four

481
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,809
to create robust but it's mostly gone

482
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,879
very well actually

483
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:30,918
okay and M rod what about you though

484
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:35,480
I haven't been directly involved with

485
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:37,700
creating any of the roads but we do have

486
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,000
somewhere with a sign for parts of our

487
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:44,450
IP space my networks a little bit

488
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,879
different I guess we have I'm sure one

489
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:52,700
transit provider but I also have a lot

490
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:55,428
of my own I my consumer and wireless

491
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:59,870
site so we do have some of our row

492
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:02,120
assign for that I look to a time at some

493
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:05,239
point in the future where it's all been

494
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,459
on the hosted solutions primarily with

495
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,860
their in I look to a time in the future

496
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:14,299
where we'll have a delegated setup that

497
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,879
great with our you know customer

498
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:19,549
provisioning tools and where we'll have

499
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:22,399
be able to delegate to a customer and

500
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:26,090
have them log in and essentially our

501
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:29,090
hosted order delegate to them as but

502
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:33,709
that'll be a fairly significant project

503
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:37,330
of itself excellent excellent excellent

504
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:40,009
so I have a question that's a regarding

505
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,470
your software in terms of actually

506
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:44,809
dealing with repositories going back to

507
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:49,000
third akia validating the routes and

508
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:51,559
that is what happens if one of the

509
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,679
repositories we need to gather your RPI

510
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:57,678
information is not available

511
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:01,340
what what what is your what is your

512
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,629
strategy in dealing with that so Adam

513
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,970
what do you guys do

514
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:07,189
yeah right now basically if that were to

515
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,529
happen we you know would potentially

516
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,870
just be accepting about you know from

517
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:14,600
from those missing you know once there's

518
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,768
a you know other approaches there I mean

519
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,059
you know we're looking at the end ripper

520
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:19,730
things all the time but that's that's

521
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:23,559
what we're having with us today we just

522
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:29,029
accepted so you feel open which is great

523
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:32,240
CF what about you yeah we essentially

524
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:34,190
have this same set up we feel open

525
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,020
we will just accept imbalance for the

526
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,630
repository that's not available but we

527
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:42,200
do stagger the refreshes or updates on

528
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:45,020
our validators so we if a repository

529
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,809
goes down we will directly have those

530
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,820
still on our boundaries to row us for up

531
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:53,720
to one hour at least

532
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:56,330
okay okay in them rod what about you so

533
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,370
I think carl fredrik looted to some of

534
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,139
this earlier there's some discussion in

535
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:03,439
the community about how to handle some

536
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:07,160
of those things and like you said the

537
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,190
standards need to be clarified a little

538
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:13,400
bit on how those situations could handle

539
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:16,460
from what I understand the validators

540
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,679
themselves keep things in cash or some

541
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,720
period of time and and they'll use

542
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:25,190
whatever the most recent information

543
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,260
they have for until I'm not sure exactly

544
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,260
what it said what it does and it may

545
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:34,460
vary from from guide from platform to

546
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:38,510
platform and and then and then

547
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:47,420
eventually it'll no time out and will it

548
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:49,429
okay I'll open s go through whether

549
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:53,990
things like you probably heard John

550
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:56,090
Byrne say on Monday Spock when he's

551
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,910
talking about art he also entered the

552
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,919
talk with some of the things within the

553
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,770
orange region and one of the things that

554
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,630
we've done is we any of the horse I have

555
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:09,170
been created within the hosted solution

556
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:12,860
on are actually propagated to the

557
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:14,030
repositories within five minutes what do

558
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,669
you guys think about that is that

559
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:30,110
appropriate sort of time for it in terms

560
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:32,410
of Adam yeah

561
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,669
sorry there's yeah feedback from someone

562
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,700
yeah I would say you know obviously

563
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:39,050
instant is always better but you know in

564
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,179
a perfect world but you know five

565
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:46,059
minutes to me seems reasonable

566
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:47,649
okay okay okay huh CF

567
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:50,950
yeah I don't have anything against Dutch

568
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:53,018
okay Nimrod

569
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,779
yeah there's been a lot of discussion

570
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:58,690
about that and in the past I think it's

571
00:26:55,779 --> 00:27:02,019
I think it needs to be recognized that

572
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:04,719
that rpki doesn't propagate at the speed

573
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:06,309
of eg P it's not it's not routing

574
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:09,820
information it's a sideband it's

575
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:11,619
something a little bit different and I

576
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,779
think what we had before where it

577
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:16,869
updated well four times a day whatever

578
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:20,799
it was that that's probably a little bit

579
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:22,988
too long a lot too long maybe and you

580
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,809
know five minutes is pretty good it

581
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:27,759
makes things work it lets us set a

582
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:31,029
pretty reasonable propagation time from

583
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:33,609
time the user puts something in to it

584
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:36,249
gets published in in Aaron's database

585
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:38,289
when the caches fetch it and then it

586
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:40,960
propagates the routers so you know we

587
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:44,529
can reasonably expect propagation within

588
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,879
an hour or so okay okay so one of the

589
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,979
things that's kind of interesting about

590
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:50,918
this and and it was actually it was

591
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:53,169
there was a discussion about this at ITF

592
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,989
a while back and we're starting to move

593
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:57,489
into future phases and one of the things

594
00:27:55,989 --> 00:28:00,309
that's interesting about this is

595
00:27:57,489 --> 00:28:02,830
somewhat analogous to DNS where there's

596
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:05,559
a DNS change there's a notification Nate

597
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,809
made to the secondaries that replicate

598
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:11,289
that information from the primary master

599
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:13,749
and Dinah's parlance to say hey look my

600
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:17,379
contents of my zone have changed please

601
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:19,210
get this now do we need some sort of

602
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:20,738
mechanism that says hey look there's

603
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,570
some change that's occurred there's a

604
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:24,999
new Rohit that's been added or there's

605
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,580
been one that's been changed do we need

606
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:30,039
to have the sort of a more sort of near

607
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,379
real-time update feature built into our

608
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:36,070
PGI or do we think that the period

609
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:38,830
period of five minutes as some sort of

610
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:41,349
number is good enough Adam what do you

611
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,249
think yeah like I said I think you know

612
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:45,009
whatever possible

613
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:46,479
you know instant is always good that

614
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:48,460
being said I do think five minutes is

615
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:50,320
reasonable and from an operation

616
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,809
standpoint you know but the difference

617
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,320
between five minutes and near instance

618
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:59,379
or near instant you know may not be that

619
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,689
big of an issue certainly in certain

620
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:01,730
circle

621
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:04,789
chances it potentially could be but I

622
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:14,860
think by and large probably okay okay

623
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:14,860
okay Carl yeah the same it's entirely

624
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,740
okay

625
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:22,370
in Nimrod I think as long as we manage

626
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:25,100
those expectations and and recognize

627
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:29,059
like I said it's it isn't routing

628
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:31,039
information it doesn't propagate but

629
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:34,129
it's pretty close it's pretty good we

630
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,990
just have to know where that line is and

631
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:37,730
and know what to expect

632
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,700
I think it's perfectly reasonable

633
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,480
timeframe okay excellent excellent

634
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,230
excellent

635
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,269
um so rpki only does deals protects with

636
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,529
origin validation those are other things

637
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:52,190
that we need to deal with in the routing

638
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:53,960
to infrastructure to secure what sort of

639
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,600
things do you think are important and

640
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,960
what sort of things you think are

641
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:03,799
working I an IETF like a sba for example

642
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,139
if that's useful and finally if a ASPA

643
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:08,658
is useful what do people think about

644
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:11,629
actually registering and letting people

645
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:14,779
see their peers so Adam let's start with

646
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:17,209
you sure you know I think path

647
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,710
validation is very interesting you know

648
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,629
obviously we're here right now we've got

649
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,799
origin covered but not full path so I

650
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:22,969
think that's you know something worth

651
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:25,370
looking at

652
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,990
you know there's potential implications

653
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:30,229
there but definitely think it's very

654
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:32,690
interesting I think ASPA is definitely

655
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,820
interesting against you know and it's in

656
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:38,629
the early stages but you know in terms

657
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,970
of publishing you know the peers and

658
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:42,918
then concern on that you know as a

659
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,840
transit free tier one you can see all my

660
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,429
adjacencies in the routing table so I

661
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,689
personally don't have a problem with it

662
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:51,080
but I can definitely see why some might

663
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:55,009
fair enough

664
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,389
yes I think it's something that is

665
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:58,100
needed because if you look at the

666
00:30:56,389 --> 00:31:00,709
quality of the different IR or databases

667
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,860
that we are dependent on today some

668
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:05,269
change is needed and we're talking about

669
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,240
authoritative or and it can be

670
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:11,029
authorized whatever records we need some

671
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,169
way of making sure that no one can just

672
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:14,869
register around

673
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:17,720
entry and led be and everyone will

674
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:18,439
accept it we need this as well but one

675
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,190
step at a time

676
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:24,619
excellent thank you in them right um I'm

677
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:28,639
a big fan of the the ideas that are

678
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:31,668
being worked on especially SVA I think

679
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:34,100
that the concept makes a lot of sense

680
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:37,730
you know it's Lincoln said is it's

681
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:40,100
really it needs some work get

682
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:43,100
implemented but that should be really

683
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,658
really interesting to do as far as the

684
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,049
you know the publication of information

685
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:50,330
that's the same thing in the routing

686
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:52,820
table the the whole purpose of this is

687
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,279
to be able to cryptographically verify

688
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:58,549
things that are in the routing tables so

689
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,399
just just because we published it in an

690
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:04,789
RPI you know it doesn't make it any more

691
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:08,768
well-known than what we see the routing

692
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:11,299
table and a capable excellent thank you

693
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:13,940
so with that those were the last of the

694
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:18,769
prepared questions and I'm gonna turn it

695
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:23,809
over to John Kristoff to bring up what

696
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:25,340
the audience has been asking about very

697
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,960
good there's there's a handful of

698
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,899
questions we gotta try to squeeze in

699
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,720
short amount of time that we have mark

700
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:34,369
you asked a lot of questions and you had

701
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,769
to expect this one of the questions that

702
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:39,259
came in it wasn't provoked by me or

703
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:41,720
solicited but essentially it's this is

704
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:44,629
is there any plane changes to the our

705
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,429
our PA so it's part one it's actually

706
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:49,488
two part question to the rest of the

707
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:52,059
panel members is are all of you using

708
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:57,350
the air Intel or not

709
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:59,418
so go ahead mark you so the the best way

710
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,840
of getting that answer is talking to

711
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:05,049
John Curran our president CEO he talked

712
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,879
on Monday and he's more than willing to

713
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:10,519
his email address as well no and you're

714
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:13,039
more than welcome to reach out to so

715
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:15,710
that is sort of the answer to the first

716
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:21,870
question and the rest is up to the rest

717
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:32,260
of the participants I would imagine Adam

718
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:38,229
sir yeah the your muted atom but the

719
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:41,680
narrow it's maybe just a quick yes or no

720
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:46,120
if you guys use their family not sorry

721
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:49,810
audio yes we use the the all the jobs

722
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:53,639
from the are ours yes numerous and we do

723
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:56,020
validate on the air as well yes

724
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:00,700
yeah we use all the pals from all depth

725
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:02,860
are Alex okay terrific thank you um next

726
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,170
question but specifically for foreign

727
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,570
abroad what are the key barriers to

728
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:09,430
enabling rpki filtering on customers

729
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:13,000
there are potentially some enhancements

730
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:16,810
that could address those barriers um I

731
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:22,530
think it's internal things primarily we

732
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:27,759
have a fairly diverse customer edge

733
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:30,820
different platforms and play and just so

734
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,160
far it's been a lot of work to to

735
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:39,150
prioritize that and we haven't gotten

736
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:41,859
there we we also have some pretty good

737
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,940
route filters that we already prefix

738
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,640
list bass track

739
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:50,290
well filters on all of our customer

740
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:53,889
edges that depend on that have served us

741
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:57,880
pretty well so far it's neither one is a

742
00:34:53,889 --> 00:35:00,549
complete solution and but that that's

743
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,830
one of the things that's it's made it

744
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,630
difficult and then you know so we like

745
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,600
having that as packet filter that prefix

746
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,340
list rather place and they're just

747
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,470
having the diversity on that edge on

748
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,320
some other platforms makes it

749
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,779
difficulties aren't we a technical issue

750
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,230
in our lead

751
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,360
I already bacon good thank you very much

752
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,280
next question is for those of you on the

753
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,930
panel it's probably exclude you broke on

754
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:31,870
this one is if you're rejecting routes

755
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:33,790
have you looked at what you're rejecting

756
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,359
is there any pattern to trends to what

757
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,490
you're rejecting the most

758
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,530
yeah I would say yeah we've definitely

759
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,330
kept close tabs on what we're rejecting

760
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,250
both in terms of prefixes and the

761
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:45,529
traffic associated with those prefixes

762
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,210
and you know I mean there's certain

763
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,130
networks that have more in balance than

764
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,960
others but I would say by and large from

765
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,180
our observation that hasn't been a

766
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,890
pattern or you know I can't say you know

767
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,200
the vast majority come from one source

768
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,879
type thing it's kind of in a spread but

769
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,430
like you know Nimrod said earlier I do I

770
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,800
was surprised at the low how low the

771
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:10,069
levels of impacted traffic open that

772
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:14,660
they were okay I take sound throws in a

773
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:18,650
group answer next question is currently

774
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:21,470
there's about 130,000 Roiz this person

775
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:26,780
telling me I'm not true but the number

776
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:28,250
has no bound were the baton is very high

777
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,510
but someone could come along in tomorrow

778
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,820
and double that number or create a

779
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,800
significant amount of just aggregation

780
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,790
any concerns from either Aaron or the

781
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,440
operators if that would happen

782
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:42,710
there are some suggestions in the

783
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,540
community what to do with host base for

784
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:47,420
us so you could essentially create a row

785
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:51,590
up for a specific host and if you look

786
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:54,590
at the ipv6 base you could do that for

787
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,420
every host address within its last 48

788
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,940
and that will generate a considerable

789
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,680
amount oh well we've been told right now

790
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,360
is that there are some protection

791
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,940
mechanism within the RIR

792
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:08,890
publishing tools so that that won't

793
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:12,140
happen but otherwise the way for us to

794
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:15,830
securely manage our routers is to

795
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:17,569
essentially not let anything figure or

796
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,569
more specific than what we would accept

797
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:22,910
on our customers sessions through the

798
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:25,580
validator as well meaning that we're

799
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:28,040
only accepting slash twenty fours ipv4

800
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:31,340
from our customers we don't need to

801
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,740
accept any rora that it's more specific

802
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:36,050
than a session for this goes aside with

803
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:39,649
also our tbh having to function and

804
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:42,860
that's a totally separate discussion but

805
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:45,950
yeah it's directly a problem but we've

806
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,370
been ashore for now okay thanks very

807
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,100
much

808
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:51,560
next question if all's

809
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:54,400
called Tier one ISPs work implement

810
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,350
origin validation what's the benefit for

811
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,420
the customers behind them enterprises

812
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:04,040
content providers and so on diplomat

813
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:06,410
rpki origin validation so are you soon

814
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:10,340
you're you're saying you're at the

815
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:13,819
question is what are they down streams

816
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:16,760
to actually do validation themselves and

817
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:20,570
and I'll admit they you know we buy by

818
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:22,880
having all of the tier ones doing organ

819
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:26,150
validation we really take a significant

820
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,800
bite out of the problem because you know

821
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,230
all of those routes are propagating

822
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,630
through through one or more of us you

823
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:35,120
know I didn't and so if we're doing that

824
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:39,890
validation then then yes or downstreams

825
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:43,339
definitely reap those benefits that said

826
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:46,970
there it doesn't it's not that difficult

827
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:49,070
as we kind of walk through to get this

828
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:53,540
going and to be able to do validations

829
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:56,210
on your own and you know it's yeah it's

830
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,920
great that we're doing it but there's

831
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:01,580
there's not really a whole lot of reason

832
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,070
that that larger enterprises are no

833
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,390
larger networks non-jew ones should be

834
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:10,790
doing shouldn't be doing it all so

835
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:13,250
everybody and do it thank you brain next

836
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:18,440
questions comes presumably someone from

837
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:20,630
both small maybe midsize isp interested

838
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,670
in the validator lying party best

839
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:25,340
practices what's the impact of a

840
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:29,060
validator being down or unreachable and

841
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:31,160
is second part of the question is would

842
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,920
you recommend or is advisable or is

843
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:39,859
acceptable to run the validator and you

844
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:42,050
know the cloud provider so there's

845
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,950
there's been some some discussion about

846
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:48,560
some of those kinds of things as well

847
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:52,970
the impact of not having a validator

848
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:55,549
being reachable has been like we said

849
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:58,490
it's actually kind of similar to the

850
00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:00,230
repository not being available you know

851
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,939
you're just not getting information from

852
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,329
that

853
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:06,760
one validator and the way they way the

854
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:09,280
systems work as long as you're receiving

855
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,910
that information from any one validator

856
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,319
you have that protection so the idea

857
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,899
there would be to build that diversity

858
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,310
you have multiple instances so that you

859
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:23,200
don't have that single point of failure

860
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:25,450
the question of running the validator

861
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,930
and loud provider is a little bit

862
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:32,140
different because that that goes to a

863
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:34,810
matter of trust you know you trust that

864
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:38,430
your connectivity to that cloud provider

865
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:41,099
and then you haven't done that the

866
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:44,919
crypto validations on your platform

867
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:48,160
locally so are you trusting them to have

868
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:52,540
done that validation on your behalf

869
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,970
it's it's possible to do it it's a good

870
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:57,790
idea that you have to make that decision

871
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:59,890
what's right for your organization these

872
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:03,579
validators are not very heavy it doesn't

873
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:07,259
take very much VM to on it the ones that

874
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:11,859
we're running are pretty skinny and they

875
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:16,000
it's it's not yeah they work pretty well

876
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:17,259
you can you can do it have to figure out

877
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,510
what's what's right for your

878
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,599
organization okay it's taking your voice

879
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:25,089
and I'm afraid we still have lots of

880
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:26,800
questions in the queue but we're

881
00:41:25,089 --> 00:41:28,299
beginning to trespass on the time of the

882
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,619
the upcoming presentation so we're gonna

883
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,170
have to end it here thank you all on

884
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:33,640
behalf of the program committee I know

885
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:38,430
if you had anything closing the same

886
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:41,020
mark but when it comes to the panelists

887
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,910
yeah I just want to thank you thank the

888
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,130
panelists and the audience for listening

889
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:48,339
in and and hopefully this helps

890
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:50,349
encourage you to adopt our PTI as a

891
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:53,200
first step of many steps that we need to

892
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:56,170
take to secure routing infrastructure so

893
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,290
thank you very much thanks everyone the

894
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:06,020
next session will begin shortly

895
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:06,020
