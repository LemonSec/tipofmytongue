[Music]

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,659
you

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,659
[Music]

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,509
hello everybody this is Chris Bluefield

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,820
again with the program committee first

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:23,020
off once again remember to fill out your

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,700
surveys again this is a new format and

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,390
we're really interested in getting your

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,970
feedback on that so that would help us

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,390
very much to to improve this format and

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,670
and bring you the better than dogs and

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,810
better content in the future

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:43,750
secondly we we're running a poll for

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,800
tomorrow's BOF we'd like to see what

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,539
topics would should come up in a BOF so

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,288
if you should see a poll coming up on

17
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:54,789
your screen so if you see that poll and

18
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,949
you know feel free to to vote on the

19
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:58,899
topics that interest you and we will

20
00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:01,739
take that feedback and roll that into

21
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:07,270
the BOF tomorrow so thank you for that

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:10,240
I'm introducing Timothy winters Tim is

23
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:13,179
the CTO of QA cafe which tests consumer

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,110
broadband equipment for ipv6 features

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,900
and compliance and it will be presenting

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:23,920
a talk on testing ipv6 transition

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:28,510
mechanisms in order to support ipv6 only

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:31,690
networks so with that Tim you have the

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,670
mic thank you thanks so much Chris so

30
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,160
today as Chris mentioned we're talking

31
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,240
about testing ipv6 transition mechanisms

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,630
in particular we're going to talk a

33
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,820
little bit about ipv6 only networks I

34
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,009
thought I'd start off with a little bit

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,289
of background about myself I've been

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,330
testing ipv6 since the early 2000s when

37
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,860
I first started I honestly never thought

38
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,970
it would leave an Academical app I

39
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,190
started at the University of New

40
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,679
Hampshire in our off lab and I started

41
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,690
testing it there I've worked as the US

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,520
government has lab and ipv6 ready test

43
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,770
lab mostly focusing at first just on

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,509
compliance but now as v6 has been

45
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,560
deployed I mean I'm using it right now

46
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,780
to talk to all of you

47
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,390
so ipv6 is now out in the world and we

48
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,640
were facing more challenges new

49
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,290
challenges I'm currently I'm the CTO at

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,179
QA cafes or some of the information I'm

51
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,459
going to talk about today is through

52
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,860
their testing they have a tool called CD

53
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,140
router that focuses on testing home

54
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,790
gateways they also have a product for

55
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,470
chart that's for viewing captures and

56
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,540
all of this is part of the experience

57
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,880
that we've gained when testing ipv6 that

58
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,989
we can use and we're going to talk about

59
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,870
a little bit today some of the lessons

60
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:39,220
we've learned I'm also of authored

61
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,840
several IETF ipv6 profiles those kind of

62
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,240
things just give you some idea of some

63
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,450
of the experience I've had to work with

64
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,190
ipv6 so the first question that often

65
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,140
comes up when we talk about this is what

66
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,090
is an ipv6 only network people have a

67
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,609
lot of different definitions for this

68
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,020
conversation what we're really what I'm

69
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:01,120
really talking about here is ipv6 only

70
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,450
ipv6 only means no ipv4 provisioned on

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,820
the network so you know there's no DHCP

72
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,730
for to assign v4 addresses there's no v4

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,920
gateways for the network engineers were

74
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,750
really concerned they might filter out

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,910
the before broadcast and this is really

76
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,769
the lower the noise so devices aren't

77
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,709
looking for ipv4 they really just want

78
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:22,209
only focus on v6 network filtering is

79
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,120
not in all networks this is really for

80
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,340
people who are on top of it are worried

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,739
about bandwidth constraints or bandwidth

82
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,079
usage um one thing I want to note you

83
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,940
know some people ipv6 only they wonder

84
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,890
if it means is v4 and removed from all

85
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,560
the products not in this case really

86
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,480
what we really what worrying before when

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,860
we say v6 only is is it just not turned

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,018
on it's not provisioned to the device

89
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,720
removing it from the devices is a much

90
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:48,660
more complex item and not really

91
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,190
included in this conversation

92
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,590
why so we're talking about what why

93
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,829
would we go to ipv6 solving a couple of

94
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,970
things one v4 addresses have run out you

95
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,250
know there's not a whole lot more blocks

96
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,040
you can get as more devices connect to

97
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,540
the internet v6 you know the real thing

98
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,019
here is running out of addresses plus

99
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:11,410
the number of devices has made v6 much

100
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:12,730
more important or vital to networks one

101
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,260
option you do have if you want to

102
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,870
continue your v4 is to put in carrier

103
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,339
grade nets they need more functionality

104
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,930
more network functions in your network

105
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,789
it just makes it more complex so it's

106
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,590
not it's not a great solution it there

107
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,680
are you know it works in a pinch but

108
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,359
there's some drawbacks there another

109
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,550
reason to go to v6 only is if you have

110
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,610
two IP protocols it means you have to

111
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,870
secure maintain and keep upkeep two

112
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,670
different topologies you're having to

113
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,380
track all your v4 stuff

114
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,690
we may have different topologies or go

115
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,010
in different directions you know often

116
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,950
people will say they get a failure on

117
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,409
they don't realize they have a v6 or v4

118
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,940
failure well one of them is working fine

119
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,410
the other side isn't so these are all

120
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,120
issues with why you might want to

121
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,060
consider moving at least parts of your

122
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,380
network to ipv6 only because then you

123
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,260
can only you only have to worry about

124
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:02,040
one of the two I P protocol calls on

125
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,110
that you know recently the US government

126
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,500
OMB office announced that they're trying

127
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:12,010
to move federal networks to 80% of them

128
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,530
by 2025 to ipv6 only I think this is a

129
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,610
you know really interesting I think

130
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,690
they're ahead of the game but I think

131
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,460
they're doing the right things in that

132
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,830
understanding that helps them secure

133
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,299
their networks because going to v6 only

134
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,010
just makes things easier it's more

135
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,170
focused they're not fighting on two

136
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,050
different fronts so all of this is why

137
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:32,500
you might want to move on to an ipv6 on

138
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,560
the environment that's the wrong

139
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,350
direction transition mechanisms so often

140
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,280
what we find transition mechanisms what

141
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,190
we're going to talk about today is

142
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,489
focused on ones that work or support v6

143
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,230
transitioning over v4 so the reason you

144
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,710
want to do this is not every device in

145
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,420
your network at the edge in particular

146
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:56,169
will be able to support v6 out of the

147
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,190
box they have a lot of different a lot

148
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,440
of different things that might cause

149
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,480
that in this case what we're really

150
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,130
talking about it the five out listed

151
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,110
here I'm going to talk a little bit

152
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,400
about some of the testing means of these

153
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,100
guys so we're gonna talk about dual

154
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,719
stack light map key map II a very

155
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,560
popular one in the mobile space for the

156
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,060
next two is dns64 nat64 many of you if

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,390
you have your phone for example t-mobile

158
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:22,390
network is v6 only you're using v6 right

159
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,039
now on your phone it works fine all of

160
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,979
those are transition mechanisms to allow

161
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,040
a v6 only device like your cell phone to

162
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,320
talk to a v4 service all of these are

163
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,790
transition mechanisms what to note is is

164
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,750
these all have different what we're

165
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,190
going to talk about is some of the

166
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,020
lessons we've learned from testing these

167
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:42,610
and what you need to look for as a

168
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:44,140
service provider but also as as a

169
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,900
manufacturer on the network it's someone

170
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,400
who's building a product on the network

171
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,440
so common testing roadblocks that we

172
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,940
found that are caused

173
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,640
she's that people want to verify work

174
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,469
we're gonna talk about fragmentation

175
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,550
that's a constant issue with this and

176
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,050
some of this has to do with the way

177
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,660
transition mechanisms work and I'll talk

178
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,550
about that conflicts configuration

179
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,130
complexity what you want to do here is

180
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,140
test it you can change or what kind of

181
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,630
options you have for configuration of

182
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,770
those many transition mechanisms one of

183
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,870
the bad things about transition

184
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,609
mechanisms is there's lots of them as

185
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,440
you saw from that list there was six

186
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,390
different ones listed there's lots of

187
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,340
options so it's not as easy it's not as

188
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,300
cut-and-dry why you would choose one

189
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,669
over the other which leads to

190
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,740
configuration and the last part is is

191
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:31,690
protocol complexity we'll talk about a

192
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,520
little bit today ipv4 and ipv6 have

193
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,090
different pregnant asian rules so we're

194
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,310
gonna talk a little bit about

195
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,560
fragmentation issues so the first thing

196
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,970
is your because there are different

197
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,420
protocols and if different fragmentation

198
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:45,730
ipv4 allows in many cases allows

199
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,940
fragmentation in the network ipv6 only

200
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,480
allows fragmentation and n so because of

201
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,810
some of this

202
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,550
there's fragmentation you have to take

203
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,010
some things into account one of them on

204
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:00,640
a high level is you want to make sure

205
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,110
that security devices fragmentation is

206
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,010
often when they see fragmented packets

207
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,510
many firewalls will shoot them down or

208
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,980
stop the connection from happening and

209
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,169
the reason they do this is because you

210
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,940
know it's complex sometimes it's

211
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,440
difficult to get all the fragments so

212
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,900
for a security firewall something doing

213
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,820
IDs or IPs it needs to see the entire

214
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,229
connection um so that's the way to get

215
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,580
all the fragments and a lot of firewalls

216
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,800
don't have time for that don't want to

217
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,409
have the resource constraints of having

218
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,030
to offer all those packets so they'll

219
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,520
drop them and that's bad and you have to

220
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,049
deal with that situation also you know

221
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,169
many of the transition mechanisms use

222
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:36,640
encapsulation so when you're using

223
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,699
something like encapsulation it

224
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,990
inherently shrinks the MTU which I'll

225
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,000
talk a little bit more about later but

226
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,830
what that means and you know I have a

227
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,170
diagram next that I'll show that it

228
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,520
causes issues with the packets getting

229
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,010
smaller and smaller at the edges which

230
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,910
leads to more fragmentation

231
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,880
additionally there are technologies like

232
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,709
UDP that don't inherently support

233
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,510
fragmentation so you have to make sure

234
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,300
that you support it on the IP layer it's

235
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,160
TCP does a lot of this for you through

236
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,329
its some of its algorithms but UDP you

237
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,009
have to be

238
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:09,008
you rely a little bit more on the IP

239
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:11,799
layer to be able to do this so this is a

240
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:13,420
common topology in this case I just said

241
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:16,119
dual stack light a lot of the

242
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,368
technologies are very very similar so

243
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:21,309
what what will happen here is you know

244
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:23,170
there's a device on either end so the in

245
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:25,238
this case the aft R would be in the isp

246
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,889
network and the CPE would be the device

247
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:30,249
on the end and the home user is trying

248
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:33,399
to get an ipv4 flow and end and they're

249
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:36,910
running over an ipv6 only network in the

250
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,139
middle so you know in this case for this

251
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,730
fragmentation example I wanted to

252
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:42,910
demonstrate the packet size on either

253
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,739
end of v4 is 1460 you know thing the

254
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,360
reason you can't use the full 1400 is

255
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:47,980
because in the middle there's an ipv6

256
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,179
layer that's encapsulating it that's

257
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,480
eating away at the bandwidth and you

258
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:53,709
have to make sure you support that you

259
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,420
know one of the things dual stack light

260
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:58,508
requires it requires fragmentation at

261
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,679
the ipv6 layer not the ipv4 layer so

262
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:01,239
there's a couple of test cases you have

263
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,309
to make sure that your device properly

264
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:05,019
is dealing with those and fragmenting at

265
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:07,059
the correct layer if it does it if the

266
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:08,649
v4 layer it causes issues and confusion

267
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:11,949
and these are common that I years we've

268
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:14,019
seen when we run these test cases with

269
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:15,758
the CPE devices so there are things to

270
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:20,110
look out for and make sure that you're

271
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:22,779
testing configuration complexity this

272
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,249
one is Network components you know the

273
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:26,559
real there's a couple things here one of

274
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:28,899
them is many many times we've had people

275
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,279
come to us saying you know an ISP say

276
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,980
hey we have these two different devices

277
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,059
and they're failing and we think there's

278
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,980
something wrong with it we can't figure

279
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:37,779
it out and in the end it turns out you

280
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,110
know it has to do with there's multiple

281
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:43,600
methods to configure the CPE the home

282
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,309
gateway and the ISP needs to make sure

283
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,629
that they're using the same variables

284
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:49,029
everywhere to make sure that the device

285
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:51,160
is properly getting the right

286
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:52,629
information obviously many of the

287
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,139
transition mechanisms you need to make

288
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:57,549
sure that when transitioning you know

289
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:58,839
everything is working correctly you got

290
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:01,209
to make sure the addressing is set up

291
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,369
correctly the routing all of this to

292
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:04,599
make this work and it just it's extra

293
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:06,459
configuration that you normally wouldn't

294
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,410
have to deal if you had an ipv6 only

295
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:09,910
network you you could just have to worry

296
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,519
about the addressing and protocols this

297
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,539
adds you know a second there are parts

298
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,740
of your network the reason you do this

299
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,149
is so that you don't have to do this

300
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,080
everywhere you're only doing this in the

301
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,340
core but it's still you have to do

302
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,370
keep some state and make sure you keep

303
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,920
track of configuration a common example

304
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,720
you know back to the fragmentation one

305
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,270
thing we always want to check is the MTU

306
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,160
configuration you want to try to avoid

307
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,660
that fragmentation issue I talked about

308
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,819
earlier so you want to make sure you

309
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,469
configure your network properly to deal

310
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,970
with these encapsulation protocols that

311
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,880
you say are empty use correctly so that

312
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,170
you avoid fragmentation issues whenever

313
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
possible

314
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,400
one thing we often test for if we want

315
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,470
to ensure that CPEs come up properly

316
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,470
after a powder reboot powder out power

317
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,970
outage or reboot often what happens is

318
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,860
sometimes the CPU will come up and it'll

319
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:59,090
default to its default configuration and

320
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,710
lose its transition mechanism you also

321
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,690
again this goes to the configuration

322
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,740
issue I talked about earlier we're

323
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,150
syncing them up you want to make sure

324
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,230
whatever management protocol you're

325
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:11,720
using TR 69 DHCP USG SNMP whatever it

326
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,850
might be your Sdn solution in today's

327
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,680
world that all of those things you want

328
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,480
to make sure that you properly have all

329
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,969
that information set up also that your

330
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,680
device when it gets that information

331
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,120
does the correct things right so you

332
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,819
want to test the protocol but you also

333
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,340
want to make sure that when you set up

334
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:31,370
transition things that there CPEs do the

335
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:34,720
right thing that they absolutely follow

336
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,680
the configuration address complexity

337
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,170
several of these translation in

338
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,400
particular translation ones they do they

339
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,790
take the hundred and you know the joy of

340
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,709
ipv6 is it has 128 bits and because of

341
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,620
that sometimes people put some semantics

342
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:51,170
address techniques stateless so they

343
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,720
change the address a little bit and this

344
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,370
makes it difficult in a testing for a

345
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,020
tester because often they needs extra

346
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,470
tools to figure out what the addresses

347
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,150
were also you know when testing this

348
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,530
stuff it becomes very difficult to test

349
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,449
across the network this is where

350
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,829
isolated testing should be you know

351
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,150
don't just set it up on your network and

352
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,680
run the testing it because gonna be very

353
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,180
hard to track an issue across the

354
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,800
network because the addresses are

355
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,030
changing and that makes all the tools

356
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,079
difficult so these are the kind of

357
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,329
things that you want to make sure that

358
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,040
you're doing in-house lab testing

359
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,490
beforehand before you actually deploy it

360
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,170
to a network obviously protocol

361
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,600
complexity I've talked about all of

362
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,699
these things you want to make sure

363
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,500
you're monitoring them with any extra

364
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,550
protocols you have to make sure you

365
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,530
understand you know

366
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,270
the downside to transition mechanisms is

367
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:39,800
you need to understand both the v4 and

368
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:41,810
v6 components of this so all these

369
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,550
things are areas that you know we run

370
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,780
into a lot of corner cases with these

371
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,020
protocols and we want to make sure that

372
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,730
you cover all of them and in particular

373
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,140
you know you want to do it in an

374
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,210
automated fashion because manually

375
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,340
testing can be very difficult because

376
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:58,670
there's so many little tiny corner cases

377
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,530
for these types of things here's my

378
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,060
contact information and I was hoping we

379
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:11,030
had I think we have a little bit of time

380
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:13,099
for questions Chris yes see he have

381
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:17,720
questions feel free to submit those to

382
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:20,990
the yeah the web interface let me love

383
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,850
to see what we have currently currently

384
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,640
I only have one question and that

385
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,880
question is what do you look for as the

386
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,520
minimum acceptable standard in per

387
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,640
vendor equipment to be considered ipv6

388
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,410
ready this is a great question

389
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,319
so there are several programs in the

390
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,150
world you can use for this question one

391
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,920
of them is there's a global the ipv6

392
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,680
forum has a global program called the

393
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,560
ipv6 ready program that is a marketing

394
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,170
program that allows devices to test the

395
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,750
core ipv6 rfcs they cover all the must

396
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,099
and shoulds and those are FCS and it

397
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,300
kind of covers your base stack and

398
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,590
really what that does is that make sure

399
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,800
when you put the device on a network

400
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:03,350
that it'll work luckily for us just

401
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,160
recently as of two days ago they updated

402
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,090
that logo to focus on ipv6 only and ipv6

403
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,640
on by default

404
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,550
so now devices who apply for that ready

405
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,410
logo are are tested in an ipv6 only

406
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,270
environment which as I talked about

407
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,839
today is becoming more and more critical

408
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,819
and then on the ipv6 enabled by default

409
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,230
we want it to be much more plug-and-play

410
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,300
we want you to be able to take a device

411
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,320
plug it in and go so that is a program

412
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,939
if you're looking for a piece of

413
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,210
equipment I strongly suggest you go to

414
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,650
ipv6 ready org they they have thousands

415
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,720
of devices at this point listed that

416
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,640
have participated in that the US

417
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,350
government has a talked about the OMB

418
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,720
mandate they have a u.s. valve device

419
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,370
list that lists all of the devices and

420
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,390
that kind of goes in a much wider scope

421
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,890
that includes things like routing

422
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,980
protocols

423
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,569
security those types of things that I

424
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,040
people might be interested in those are

425
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,830
two great lists to start with for

426
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,270
looking for what vendors have done what

427
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,950
testing that have had independently

428
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,960
verified in all of those places that's

429
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,970
the upside to both of those programs is

430
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:06,290
they independently verify that

431
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:11,300
information thank you we have one more

432
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:15,410
question the queue to more okay first

433
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,780
one why would I do aft and or other

434
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:21,350
tunneling mechanisms instead of just

435
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:25,040
doing dual stack and possibly cgn if I

436
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:27,260
have an ipv4 address space shortage so

437
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,459
right this is the common question so one

438
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,990
of the things I talked about earlier is

439
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,850
if you're doing dual stack everywhere

440
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,040
that you know I think people some people

441
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,480
envision to world you know five or ten

442
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,400
years ago where we would have dual stack

443
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,390
for quite some time what's starting to

444
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:43,189
happen is a it means you have to protect

445
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,260
your network and monitor two different

446
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,300
IP addresses all the time right because

447
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,890
if some services support v6 some support

448
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,290
before you have to monitor to make sure

449
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,730
the end user can get to both of those so

450
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,860
if you want to run dual stack you can

451
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,750
but it's just more difficult what we've

452
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,920
been finding recently there's a lot of

453
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,360
people have had success you know it

454
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,099
started kind of in the data centers

455
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,660
where they were greenfield and they were

456
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,339
able to go v6 only but it's really

457
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,800
starting to show up in places and mobile

458
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:10,099
and other networks obviously enterprises

459
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,349
have been slower to deploy this but what

460
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,939
we've seen is the value of ipv6 only is

461
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,800
then you can focus not having to worry

462
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,000
about dealing with two fronts at the

463
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,389
same time here you're really just doing

464
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,829
that for CG ends the real deal is is you

465
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,240
know they can exist in the network it's

466
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,099
an extra function and you have to make

467
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,440
sure that all of the things are properly

468
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,879
synced it's really tough with logging

469
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,380
and some other things to be able to

470
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,360
properly track what's going on in the

471
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,490
network um they can work and I think

472
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,010
they work in a pinch but I think it adds

473
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,180
extra networks comp you know complexity

474
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,840
and all we hear about today is people

475
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:45,400
wanting to avoid network um you know

476
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,399
complexity as much as possible

477
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,580
thank you apologize on the behalf of my

478
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,580
landscapers uh-uh

479
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,010
no that's fine barely good okay all

480
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,960
right okay next question

481
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,640
are there certain applications that

482
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:06,250
you've seen that typically have more

483
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:08,440
issues on a v6 only network so areas

484
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,900
where we've run into problems you know

485
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,160
it's kind of funny there's some places

486
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,930
where we've seen issues with

487
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,580
applications on odd stuff like

488
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,800
installing or updating so the cloud

489
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,600
service that does the install is v4 only

490
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,909
if you're on a v6 only network all the

491
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,889
sudden you can't update your software so

492
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,290
that's an interesting one we've seen a

493
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,270
couple of issues there in generic

494
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,659
applications you know I'm not sure one

495
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,920
place works obviously cloud services you

496
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,420
want to make sure that the cloud service

497
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,240
supports it and everything underneath

498
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,310
that I mentioned the installers and

499
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,900
updates or other places for you know

500
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,669
areas of applications we've seen it all

501
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,460
over we've seen a lot of success in a

502
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:52,840
lot of places an apple helps a lot with

503
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:54,510
this when they move their App Store to

504
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,629
these gentlemen

505
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,629

506
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,800
sorry Chris

507
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,000
and I think that's where we're at yeah

508
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,810
if you have any more questions Chris

509
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,540
please feel free to fire away okay

510
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:16,669
there's one more question okay oh I'll

511
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:19,790
get mute immediately afterwards the

512
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:22,580
questioner wonders discuss 100% ipv6

513
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:25,610
deployment for an isp for businesses and

514
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,580
subscribers are you forced to use a six

515
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:35,709
to four DMS for subscribers in order to

516
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:38,990
be 100 compatible with the Internet no

517
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,550
you you could do I mean to be completely

518
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,230
honest right not everything like not

519
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,360
everything on the internet is v6 only

520
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,700
available today right there's still

521
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,280
plenty of services that do v4 and that's

522
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,370
where something like a dns64 comes into

523
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,629
play and can help the the network you

524
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,090
know in a perfect world we would love

525
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,230
for everything to be accessible v6 but

526
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,330
that's not gonna work so I think

527
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,400
realistically where we are right now if

528
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,620
you tried to have an isp that was doing

529
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,660
v6 only it's going to need some sort of

530
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:09,709
transition mechanism at the edge whether

531
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:11,420
it's a nat64 or a dns64 i think that's

532
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,870
kind of you know some combination of

533
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,000
those today to get you where you want to

534
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,949
go I think the good news is we've had a

535
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,960
lot of success using those transition

536
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,470
mechanisms there's lots of deployments

537
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,950
that have done that so I I think that's

538
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,950
really good

539
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:33,170
alright one more question if Eman and on

540
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,840
an end-user network and I already have

541
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:40,520
sufficient ie v4 space is there any

542
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,139
benefit to going ipv6 only so if you're

543
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,560
on an N Network and you have plenty of

544
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,910
v4 addresses maybe not the only thing is

545
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,710
I think in the future what might happen

546
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,120
is is you know there's two things

547
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,890
there's been a couple of interesting

548
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,409
studies Facebook put out a study where

549
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,540
they found that v6 only connections were

550
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,620
faster and the reason for that is

551
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,800
because they didn't have the NAT

552
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,479
translator so you know I I'm not sure

553
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,860
that's true on every network but I do

554
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,290
think there's some benefits to doing

555
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,120
that you know I also think in the future

556
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,800
I think you know today probably not

557
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,820
a huge benefit to doing it but the real

558
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,889
thing is that you don't want to get

559
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,530
caught at the point where in the future

560
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:18,110
somebody props up a v6 only service that

561
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:20,180
your users want to get to and can't and

562
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,770
then your users are using the transition

563
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,010
mechanism and they're getting a worse

564
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,510
experience so you know moving to v6 only

565
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,620
maybe you don't need to right now but

566
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,920
you'd only want to make sure you're a

567
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,750
deploying v6 and then B for v6 only it's

568
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,400
really you know the benefit of getting

569
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,990
rid of all the holes that you had to

570
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,850
plug when you were deploying your ipv4

571
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:43,070
to one all right

572
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:47,090
thank you I don't think we have any more

573
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:51,350
questions in the queue so I thank you
