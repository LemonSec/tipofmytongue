given out four scholarships over the

92
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:38,720
course of 2019 so this particular slide

93
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:40,790
focuses on the 10 communities that were

94
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,480
directly impacted by the efforts of nan

95
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:49,220
off over the course of 2019 education

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,340
the now that immersion program is

97
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,810
critical to what we do the board several

98
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,790
years ago determined that it would be

99
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,200
important to outreach the students to

100
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:01,010
give them a chance to participate within

101
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,200
our art community and last year as it

102
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:08,420
said before we hosted 62 students from

103
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,980
four different universities skim one of

104
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,018
the things has been a passion for me is

105
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,119
to get out into the community to get

106
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,430
more directly involved and I had the

107
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,739
opportunity to participate in a stem

108
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,690
program and also community engagement in

109
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,789
the city of Montgomery Alabama

110
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,650
it was amazing opportunity I met some

111
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:26,539
amazing people and I got a chance to be

112
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,669
representative nanog and to share with

113
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:30,080
other communities about Nantz vision and

114
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:35,510
about our community and the efforts that

115
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:37,919
we take that we do outreach

116
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:41,300
one of our big outreach events that we

117
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,640
did that I proceeded last year was

118
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,380
participating in supporting I sock in

119
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,110

communities within North America they

121
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,060
have a marvelous program and I was had a

122

127
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,510
in the areas that need it for most now

128

transparency trying to show you what

135
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,510
these meetings are like in terms of

136
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,030
statistical level and how they impact

137
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,670
our selves and so that we can measure

138
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,419
are we doing you know the things that we

139

gonna live in a digital collective world

155
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,090
world and staying in tune with that is

156
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,160
critical to what we do and we put a lot

157
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,900
of energy and effort in that the staff

158
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,270
works tirelessly to try to promote our

159
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,400
organization so that communities outside

160
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,469
of nanna understand what we're doing and

161
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,650
also helping to form our own existing

162

168
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,260
thousand page views and we averaged

169
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,870
seven thousand seven hundred and

170
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,070
eighty-six visitors per month so very

171
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,780
fortunate in the amount of people that

172
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,500
do kind of does she have to see what

173
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:11,640
namaha is doing social media quick

174
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,750
example on course of 2019 we had one

175
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,360
thousand one hundred and twenty three

176
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,370
new followers in our Instagram for a

177
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:23,630
total of twenty three hundred people get

178
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:26,540
to see Malik's messaging sponsorship if

179
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,590
conferences our heart and soul

180
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,720
sponsorship is the lifeblood that keeps

181
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,450
us going we wouldn't be where we are

182
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,050
without the support of our sponsors and

183
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:39,659
I think all of you this report can kind

184
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,060
of details who all's involved in what

185
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,730
they do and if you believe in what we're

186
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,560
doing as a community I would encourage

187
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,580
you to corporations to consider

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,790
sponsoring Nana

189
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:57,300
and our efforts financials we are a

190
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,340
community driven nonprofit we believe in

191
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,440
transparency and openness there are no

192
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,780
smoke and mirrors

193
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,230
during our report we highlight our

194
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,700
finances what we've done and here's an

195
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,460
opportunity for you to kinda peer in and

196
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,380
see a little closer look of nanog and

197
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,390
those in terms of what we do and our

198
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,540
financial impact and what we're doing in

199
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:21,090
that regards so it's a very important

200
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,280
for us that we are transparent open to

201
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:30,000
our community and our annual port is a

202
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:32,339
party so Nana stories and Nana TV these

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,950
are part of our efforts to inform our

204
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:38,970
community about what we're doing and

205
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:40,940
kind of highlight certain aspects of the

206
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,820
efforts that we put on we share stories

207
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:47,310
featuring people within our community

208
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:50,640
successes that we've done just recently

209
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,469
I actually wrote an article this has

210
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,730
been released today that addresses some

211
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,430
of the issues that are currently

212
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,880
happening across our nation and across

213
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,739
our world everything impacts us we're

214
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,790
all human this is all part of our human

215
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,310
community

216
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:09,510
and now nagas a part of that world and

217
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:12,239
and this is you know articles like this

218
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,439
are a part in showing solidarity with

219
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,120
the world in which we live in the

220
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,860
community that we serve now on TV one

221
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,510
thing that Nanog has over the course of

222
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,930
years of doing conferences is that we

223
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:27,480
have an incredible library of talks now

224
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,969
on TV being focuses and highlights on

225
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,340
the talks that are giving five those in

226
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,170
our community we have sessions which

227
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,610
versus speeches on talk talk talk talks

228
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,260
that you've done we did a section

229
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,710
section this year on working from home

230
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,540
as a response to the kovat crisis and we

231
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,540
also do throwbacks from our archives so

232

I appreciate your participation and then

268
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:14,089
I'd like to turn over to Tina Morris the

269
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:17,700
vice-chair of the nail on board

270
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,170
hi everybody I apologize my slides we're

271
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,720
not working properly so I'm going to do

272
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,339
this without any I just wanted to take a

273
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,070
couple of minutes to let you know that

274
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,900
we're going to do a special election

275
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:30,840
you'll see an announcement for that

276
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,120
election come out on June 15th

277
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,760
it'll be out on the website in the

278
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:40,110
member mailing list essentially it's a

279
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:44,220
very small though on a nano I log change

280
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:46,710
we're going to change the tongue start

281
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,320
date for board members that are elected

282
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,360
in a standard annual election they will

283
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,450
start in January rather than immediately

284
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,570
upon election this just allows for a

285
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,880
little bit more of a transition period

286
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,680
for newcomers to get ramped up before

287
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,730
they have to make any decisions about

288
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,349
the nanoa organization it will just be a

289
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,660
couple of minor changes and we will

290
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:14,100
convey those on the website as well as

291
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:16,709
email on June 15th on June 20th through

292
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,090
June 22nd voting will be open and on

293
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:21,360
July 4 I'm sorry

294
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,770
take that back on July 20th through 22nd

295
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,290
voting will be open so you'll have a

296
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,900
full month to review the changes and ask

297
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:31,550
questions prior to voting and then on

298
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,920
July 23rd the results will be announced

299
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:37,079
once again they're they're very

300
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,360
straightforward changes there's only I

301
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,130
believe four of them throughout the

302
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,160
entire bylaws and we'll highlight them

303
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:48,320
specifically for you in detail that's

304
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:51,510
all I have I'll hand it to Vincent so

305

312
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:15,300
session talks and the return of birds of

313
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:20,040
a feather at manoa 79 last time we had

314
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:22,920

315
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,260
68 back in February of this year the

316
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,510
program committee was hard at work we

317
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,090
were

318
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,460
planning for Boston all before the

319
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,580
world's current events that has changed

320
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:37,570
their normal BC had to pivot and adjust

321
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:40,450
plan corn a a remote only conference and

322
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,040
as a reminder were volunteers we all had

323
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,020
to deal with our day jobs and everything

324
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,750
that the pandemic brought along to our

325
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:51,610
daily lives we still though collectively

326
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:54,040
reviewed and voted on 53 talks even with

327
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,590
53 submissions we couldn't accept every

328
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,780
talk we needed to give some

329
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,480
considerations given the change in

330
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,160
format come on and by certain

331
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,910
constraints from our speakers due to the

332
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,980
pandemic as a result though don't fret

333
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:13,480
we may see some of these talks at nanog

334
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:16,570
80 so what are some of these

335
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,330
considerations being a remote only

336
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,880
meeting we decided on a bridged program

337
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,970
working from home there's a lot more

338
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,410
distractions as everyone has seen more

339
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,630
than likely you've already been staring

340
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,100
at a computer screen for 8 or so hours a

341
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,360
day and we were trying to be very

342
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,990
mindful of that

343
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:39,790
keeping sessions to 60 minutes at max

344
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:44,230
this time around so one of the questions

345
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:46,689
that we do have is would you like to see

346
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:51,490
tutorials that maybe 90 to 120 minutes

347
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:54,670
in this format along with dealing with

348
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,530
the time zone differences not only in

349
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,560
North America but also from our global

350
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:01,180
participants was another factor

351
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,819
personally in my newcomers lunch I had

352
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,250
participants that were in the UK China

353
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,020
and Germany we appreciate all our

354
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,120
attendees especially those that were

355
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:16,060
international and dealt with the time

356
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:17,410
differences so going forward we will

357
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,630
always have an option to remotely

358
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,400
participate in a nog just like I

359
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,050
mentioned that nuke about the newcomers

360
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,689
launch having the ability to participate

361
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:28,630
remotely opens the doors to a wider

362
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,390
audience and more speakers as well as

363
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:33,820
more content actually we had three

364
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,990
speakers that were international at

365
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,990
nanog 79

366
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,980
this was our inaugural full remote

367
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,770
participation meeting and hopefully

368
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,020
everyone enjoyed it so far it's going to

369
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:49,650
be an involving format possibly multiple

370
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,360
tracks and more ways to collaborate we

371
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:54,180
also need to consider when we're able to

372
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,450
have an in-person conference again how

373
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,359
to create a hybrid and blend the remote

374
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,500
access and the in-person attendees so

375
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,870
that we can have a rich and full

376
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:08,820
experience I've gone through some of the

377
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,220
feedback that we have had over day one

378
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,960
and paid to generally it's been very

379
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,570
positive about the platform that we've

380
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,630
been using we are obviously looking at

381
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:21,050
ways to improve we've heard you guys

382
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:23,939
session transitions preserving chats

383
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:26,459
hallway chats the ability to do direct

384
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,930
messages and side chats so we hear yeah

385
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,970
we're looking at how to be able to

386
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:34,949
enhance and improve that or an ad

387
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,260
revisiting prior conference talks that

388
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,480
was a resounding yes

389
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,430
possibly incorporating updates reboots

390
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,860
of certain talks so I'm gonna look

391
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,900
everyone here in the community to

392
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,670
provide feedback on which talks they may

393
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:54,030
want to see reboots up scheduled changes

394
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:55,110
just like in person things change at

395
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,930
last-minute usually these are

396
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,900
last-minute constraints sometimes these

397
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:03,060
are due to technical issues or

398
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:05,760
constraints from speakers as much as we

399
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,629
try and avoid changes and work with all

400
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,379
parties involved

401
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:13,410
things happen and we thank you guys for

402
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,790
being patient with us all we're looking

403
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:18,060
to do is provide the best that we can do

404
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:20,639
for the community more social events as

405
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:23,250
well is something that we've heard I and

406
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,230
obviously this is very difficult given

407
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,020
trying to do this in a remote only

408
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,620
format but we've had very good success

409
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,090
with newcomers the women in tech things

410
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,189
like the virtual happy hours that we've

411
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,959
seen pop up you know we're looking at

412
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,520
how to be able to formalize that and

413
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,520
give you guys a very rich experience

414
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:46,930
your feedback is very important now

415
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,790
to help what man on conference will

416
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,490
look like but ensure that we seek our

417
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:56,290
content that is relevant and important

418
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:58,840
to our community so please fill out

419
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:01,330
those surveys it is very important and

420
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,439
it's never too late to submit a talk for

421
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:07,389
a future Nanog lastly if you are

422

currently not an add-on member but like

423
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,380

424
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:17,080
days please consider joining the

425
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:20,380
naginata nanog community as one and with

426
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:25,060
that Liz I think we have time for

427
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:27,580
questions and answers very much for

428
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,990
those talks I really appreciate that we

429
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:35,800
do have a couple of questions that came

430
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:38,350
in the first question is basically the

431
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,970
Nanog that show that we saw was great

432
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,370
it's gonna be great also to be able to

433
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,650
see these on YouTube do we know when

434
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:54,489
they're gonna be upgraded or updated

435
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:56,380
into YouTube ma'am you thank you for

436
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,060
that sorry about that the plan is that

437
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:05,170
they'll be released two weeks after the

438
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:06,879
close of this event great so a lot of

439
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:09,430
people are asking about having an

440
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,320
officially sanctioned a chat session and

441
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:16,000
and I think this all fits into the idea

442
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:18,310
of having more social time is that

443
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,140
something that that the board of

444
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:22,270
directors of the program committee is

445
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,960
going to be looking into and kind of

446
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:30,840
committed to finding figuring out how to

447
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:33,730
improve that our platform in that way

448
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,459
I'll try to attempt to answer that yes

449
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:40,120
the we are looking to at that the board

450
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,170
met in at the close of last year and one

451
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,139
of the things that are a part of our

452
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:46,870
strategic guidance was to explore

453
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,520
improvements to some of the creating

454
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,949
forums and other outlets for the

455
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,110
community to be able to connect so we

456
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,600
are exploring those issues and be hoping

457
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,659
to be announced some things if not in

458
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,560
our Fall Meeting in the first

459
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,570
next year great thank you I think a

460
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,590
question that's coming up for a lot of

461
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:10,860
the members is about neon eggs position

462
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:13,350
right now with Colvin what does the fact

463
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,090
of not having physical meetings due to

464
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,370
Nano from a financial perspective does

465
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,929
that put the group into any kind of

466
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,189
trouble or does the fact that does it

467
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:25,620
actually help because those are

468
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:28,970
expensive meetings Tina do you want to

469
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,969
tackle that one or do you want me to

470
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:39,209
there is a cost to the virtual meeting

471
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:41,220
it is not free at all um but obviously

472
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,220
it's less than in person but there's

473
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,700
also not the revenue so so it's it's a

474
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,280
balance we have a repop you know we have

475
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,380
a fund for a reason we've been lucky

476
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,930
enough to keep sponsors and get sponsors

477
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,880
for this meeting but yes we're

478
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,220
definitely evaluating and looking at

479
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,360
case by case of all of our scenarios

480
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,500
that we we tried to field in coming up

481
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,719
with the right amount to have in our

482
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,200
accounts cancelling meetings for a full

483
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,230
year was just we we have accounted for

484
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,330
dwindling numbers a recession all sorts

485
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,030
of things but this just wasn't on our

486
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:21,750
radar and there are cancellation fees

487
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:24,690
associated with venues and contractors

488
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:29,520
as well so it's still work-in-progress I

489
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:31,110
think you want to add to that uh and I

490
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,990
and I think you're right on all those

491
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,699
those accounts we weigh a lot over the

492
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,160
past two months the board has been

493
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,860
meeting every week accessing the

494
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,540
situation trying to stay current trying

495
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,490
to evaluate best ways that we can serve

496
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,740
our community and protect our community

497
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,690
so there's a lot that goes into it the

498
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,000
PC has been putting a lot of effort and

499
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,440
work into the present the whole

500
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,230
conference the online conference that

501
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,800
you've seen we take the needs of our

502
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:00,570
community very very seriously and we are

503
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,840
doing everything we can to assure that

504
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:09,450
we continue to serve you as best we can

505
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,810
agreed thank you I think a couple of

506
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,400
people have brought

507
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,649
over the course of a couple days when

508
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,530
can we get back to Boston I think it was

509
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,150
maybe 20 years since noggin it was a

510
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,210
very anticipated event to have it in

511
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,950
Boston I know that we have our schedule

512
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:29,140
out for about two and a half years yeah

513
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:31,540
I was looking forward to we're planning

514
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,640
on putting Boston in the top of our

515
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,889
queue for future meetings we really

516
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,360
wanted to have this meeting we were very

517
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,560
sad that we couldn't have the meeting

518
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:45,340
and we're going to try to get into

519
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:47,440
Boston as soon as we can so Edward and

520
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,320
Vince what was the biggest hurdle for

521
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,010
getting nanog online this time around in

522
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,840
such a quick way well one thing that we

523
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,680
were fortunate in that kind of making

524
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,020
this a little easier

525
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,630
did you tell us a partner we had

526
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:04,240
contracted with them to provide services

527
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:07,420
for our webcast

528
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,330
and so in Nanog 78 was the first time

529
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,310
that we used their services we knew that

530
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,649
they offered these features but we

531
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,600
hadn't taken advantage of it so it was

532
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,650
pretty easy they understood who we were

533
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,360
they understood a little bit about our

534
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,370
needs and it was just a matter of kind

535
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,770
of driving that so from a technical

536
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,989
standpoint that worked within the

537
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,879
logistics were the part that came in and

538
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,950
made things really complex so there was

539
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,450
a huge effort between things that were

540
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,490
going on in the background with staff

541
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,640
and also things that were happening with

542
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,410
the with the program committee I'll talk

543
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,920
a bit about the staff efforts and then

544
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,900
I'll let Vincent talk about the

545
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,870
community the the program efforts so

546
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,760
from a stamp staff standpoint we had to

547
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,399
make sure that messaging was on point we

548
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,650
had to make sure that we were providing

549
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,670
the proper back-end support in terms of

550
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:59,080
graphics design we were you don't

551
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,970
Valerie are struggling and running to

552
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,970
make sure that she can provide and

553
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,440
switch gears for making things work from

554
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,200
virtually as opposed to a face-to-face

555
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,700
meeting our developers were working to

556
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,650
add additional features that we can

557
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,420
support this so there were a lot of

558
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,910
things going on to make this happen and

559
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,770
in my personal opinion I think with the

560
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:20,010
compressed time frame that we had I

561
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:23,490
think everyone has did amazing job

562
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,730
considering the circumstances Vincent

563
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,320
yeah

564
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,750
I totally agree with you Edward I mean

565
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,549
part of it was we were all grabbed um

566
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,530
trying to get everything ready for

567
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:34,929
Boston then everything hit so it was

568
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,240
kind of a lull at that point not only

569
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:39,820
for what are we going to do but it was

570
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,280
more of are we getting the amount of

571
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,960
submissions that we normally get for

572
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,610
this because I think everyone from the

573
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,919
is also trying to figure out well is

574
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:50,439
other things going to happen but

575
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,110
fortunately enough after we've decided

576
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,910
on doing a remote only then we had to

577
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,770
transition gears and well how are we

578
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,630
actually going to be able to get some of

579
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:01,330
this content and obviously you know

580
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,620
we're all in this business trying to

581
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,928
figure out how do we get the best

582
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,760
performance or the best experience and

583
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:09,610
that's why we decided to possibly pre

584
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:13,179
record some talks and then have some as

585
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,020
live and as I mentioned before you know

586
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,660
the program committee we're all

587
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,610
volunteers right so our day jobs most of

588
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,350
us being network engineers we had to

589
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,000
deal with in the internal issues of how

590
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,830
do we scale up these networks I mean a

591
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
lot of people that were on the program

592
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:30,428
committee were scaling up VPN resources

593
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,040
to for all the work from home so all

594
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,370
that compounded I mean I totally agree

595
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,290
with you

596
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:38,350
Edward there that I think a lot of the

597
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:40,690
changes was just the this is new to us

598
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:44,080
and it was such a compressed timeframe

599
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:46,690
but again we're all professionals we've

600
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,689
done this so it's just a matter of being

601
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,490
able to pivot and shift as well as thank

602
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,799
you to the community for your

603
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:57,160
submissions as well yeah and I would

604
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,990
like to add that as well there is the

605
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,450
the factor involved we were always

606
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,400
planning and kind of visiting doing this

607
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,400
suddenly the situation happened that

608
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,080
forced it front and center but now we're

609
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,049
going to continue to offer a virtual

610
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,699
component in future meetings and it was

611
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:14,918
you move into a high rule exploring what

612
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,720
that exactly that would look like but we

613
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:19,390
believe that we can serve our community

614
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:24,400
in a broader fashion by being able to

615
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:27,010
have them engage them online so I think

616
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,480
it's a wonderful situation and I'm

617
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:30,480
excited to see where we take advance

618
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,620
guys for those answers I think one of

619
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,600
the things that has been really

620
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,540
interesting about this jnana is the fact

621
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,010
that we had over 2,000 people signed up

622
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,340
the last I knew I know that for the last

623
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:48,070
several new mags we've had between 900

624
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,449
and maybe 1300 so almost double the

625
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,520
amount of people that we've had here and

626
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,750
I'm not sure how big a proportion of

627
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,100
those are newer members but I've

628
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,260
definitely during the newcomers lunch

629
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,060
talked to a lot of people here who are

630
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,680
here for the first time and we get some

631
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,770
comments from you guys on people who are

632
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,070
here for the first time about how they

633
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:07,330
could go about submitting talks and

634
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,669
tutorial proposals and things like that

635
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:14,699
who are the newer to our community and

636
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,700
and let's talk about the way nanog runs

637
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,870
now let's you start out Vincent and I'll

638
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:22,210
come behind you

639
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:27,100
well I was going to say the easiest way

640
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:29,160
is to go to the website and essentially

641
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:32,439
there will be a option there for

642
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:35,320
submitting a talk if I if I had it

643
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,480
available and post the URL but that's

644
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:42,220
going to be the easiest way outside of

645
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,320
that I I put the names of the 25 program

646
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,330
committee members feel free to reach out

647
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,830
to any of them reach out to myself if

648
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,379
there's a topic that you're looking to

649
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:52,659
put out and you just want to kick the

650
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,800
tires of hey I'm thinking about this I'd

651
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,160
be more than happy to have that

652
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,230
conversation as well as how can I

653
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,210
contribute how can I volunteer for Nanog

654
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,710
feel free to reach out to myself or any

655
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,900
of the other program committee members

656
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,970
any of the board members we'd be more

657
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:10,090
than happy to assist you or point you in

658
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:12,400
that right direction and I would also

659
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:15,340
like to add to that that one of the

660
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,520
things that I have been offering the the

661
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,800
PC is that you know we do have folks on

662
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,220
staff who can support and help these

663
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,649
efforts both Lee and I have a design

664
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,660
background and if there's anything the

665
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,980
community needs in terms of creating a

666
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,520
graphic that can help better express

667
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,950
certain things we have brandy who is is

668
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,379
a writer and not that we can create the

669
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:41,680
presentations for you but we can offer

670
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:44,410
additional support so and and I think

671
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,030
also there's an opportunity

672
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,460
and again I would roll this back to

673
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,320
Vincent and program committee is to kind

674
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,300
of get a broader idea of the kind of the

675
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,370
talks that we would like to see or

676
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,530
things that were open to for submission

677
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,419
so if Vincent you could address kind of

678
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,860
in a broader sense what are some of the

679
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,720
talks and some of the things that they

680
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:07,000
can do look for the submit sure

681
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,440
obviously it's only being technology

682
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,320
focused it's always about new and

683
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:15,600
upcoming technologies we've seen things

684
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,860
about 5g right we saw the LFA talk

685
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,330
believe it was tuned an eyes ago we were

686
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,060
already talking about four hundred gig

687
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,830
and when that would come around and what

688
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,510
that actually looked like maybe things

689
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,340
like eight hundred gigs so anything

690
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,270
that's new and interesting technology is

691
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,830
always on the table other things that

692
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:37,540
may not be top of mind we're always

693
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:40,210
looking to have talks or interact with

694
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,879
the other organizations like IETF

695
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:45,550
standards organizations right we had

696
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,340
some talk about the multicast this past

697
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,330
week so those are all obviously

698
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,189
interesting talks

699
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,350
we're always also looking for talks from

700
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,630
academia students because always looking

701
00:29:53,350 --> 00:30:00,399
at from that perspective as we talk

702
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:02,920
about diversity not only from a personal

703
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:06,540
perspective but from a diversity from a

704
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:10,380
thought perspective that helps us grow

705
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:12,909
lastly I will say I'm also personally

706
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,070
interested in a lot of the career

707
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:18,970
development type talks we had the white

708
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:21,370
boarding 101 or how to white board talk

709
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,830
these are kind of the skills that I

710
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,110
think as we grow through our careers are

711
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:28,810
really useful not only for the people

712
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,280
that are seasoned but also for the

713
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,230
newcomers or the people that are just

714
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,690
getting out of college the new college

715
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,220
grads these are skills that I think that

716
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,500
we've just taken for granted but it's

717
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,510
very good for them to witness firsthand

718
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,970
didn't help with their careers so those

719
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:46,379
are the kind of general talks that I

720
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,380
would say that we're looking for

721
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:54,440
Edward so so the question kinda comes up

722
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:57,169
of if we are going to be this way for a

723
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,330
little while maybe not in a city and in

724
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:01,100
a specific location does that broaden

725
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,199
our horizons for who we can have in

726
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,550
terms of keynote speakers and people who

727
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,740
are willing to travel has that been

728
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:08,720
thought about and have we kind of done

729
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,400
you know thought through those issues of

730
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,320
how can we take advantage in this

731
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,320
situation not just be thrown into it

732
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:21,590
well one thing that I would say is part

733
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:24,710
of our commitment to a virtual platform

734
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,840
it also allows us to I think expand the

735
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,210
amount of speakers that we can have I

736
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,639
mean we're now able to have people who

737
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,190
can resent from around the world they

738
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,260
are no longer restricted by the location

739
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,410
of where they are so I think that it

740
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,820
will greatly expand our reach greatly

741
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,550
expand the kind of talks that we can

742
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,260
offer and I'm personally very very

743
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,510
excited about this I just think this is

744
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:51,530
going to benefit our community in a

745
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:53,000
myriad of ways and I'll add to that you

746
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:55,340
know usually we were trying to pick a

747
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,330
keynote speaker local to the host city

748
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:01,939
just to have that local Flair but now

749
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:04,189
having this expanding option I think as

750
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:07,040
you mention Edward that's really going

751
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:09,170
to help expand who we can get as far as

752
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,720
a keynote speaker because they may not

753
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:13,309
have to travel now and a lot of the

754
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,860
constraints is because they need to be

755
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:21,770
somewhere is what was limiting us in the

756
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:25,520
past these are really exciting times hey

757
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:28,070
Green that last and final question that

758
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,510
we have for you guys and while we're

759
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,580
answering this if there's anyone who has

760
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,830
any further questions for a panel please

761
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,570
submit them or we're going to go into

762
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:39,169
the closing so the last question is

763
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:41,990
about neon on a tee in Seattle do we

764
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,760
have an idea of if it's going to be

765
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,950
considered that will view that in person

766
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,790
is there a cut-off date what is that

767
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:53,450
looking like I'll start then I'll kind

768
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:55,730
of let kind of Tina was continuing off

769
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:58,340
she has anything else we are looking at

770
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,429
it closely we're looking at variety of

771
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,529
scenarios we're exploring that

772
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:04,179
example let's say social distancing is

773
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:05,919
most likely going to be enforced if we

774
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:07,330
have a meeting in Seattle what would

775
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,129
that look like what would that look like

776
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,949
at a conference where everyone has to be

777
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:13,600
six feet apart from each other that

778
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:16,360
we're not going to have buffet lines and

779
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,428
you'd have to be served at so many

780
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,439
people on the table it would greatly

781
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:23,980
change the experience that that we're

782
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,779
all accustomed to in going to an an odd

783
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,980
meeting and so all those are all the

784
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,840
things that we're looking at we're

785
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:35,350
exploring the financial impact if we

786
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:36,699
cancel a lot goes into this and so we

787
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,049
don't take it lightly don't take it very

788
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,429
seriously and we're always thinking

789
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:44,740
what's in the best interest of our

790
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:46,840
community and much the same as whatever

791
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:50,799
it just said is we're looking at our

792
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:54,249
contract dates or cancel my dates local

793
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:57,070
government I I'm based in Seattle so um

794
00:33:54,249 --> 00:34:00,960
I'm paying a lot of attention to the

795
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:03,668
venue it's it's just too early to tell

796
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,669
I'm very hopeful that we'll have an

797
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:09,760
in-person meeting we certainly haven't

798
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:10,540
decided to cancel but it's just too

799
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,780
early to tell

800
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:15,969
unfortunately I wish we knew we're

801
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,549
looking at all the every possible

802
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:20,078
scenario that you could think of and if

803
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:22,809
you have suggestions please let us know

804
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,460
yes that's why feedback at nine I got

805
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:26,829
Ord we want your feedback

806
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,849
it helps us governing it helps direct us

807
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:30,040
it helps us understand what our

808
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:31,149
community wants and we do understand

809
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,558
that even if we have an in-person

810
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:34,989
meeting it's probably going to be

811
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:38,169
lightly attended a lot of international

812
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:41,379
probably won't be able to attend it's um

813
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:42,158
it's not gonna be what we hoped I don't

814
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:45,520
believe it

815
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,179
but if who knows where we'll be by

816
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,489
October

817
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:50,490
I hope we're more normal than today

818
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:58,150
great well I really appreciate you your

819
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:00,490
time on this panel it's been it's been a

820
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,809
great experience for all of us attending

821
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:04,089
