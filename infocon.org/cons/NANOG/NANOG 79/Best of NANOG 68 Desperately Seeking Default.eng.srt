1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
Hey

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,030
[Music]

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,659
you

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,659
[Music]

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:18,198
hi everyone for the next session we're

6
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:21,259
doing a rerun a little throwback let's

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,919
say from a previous nanog we have

8
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:29,539
selected one of our best folks from nano

9
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:31,929
68 desperately seeking default from Jeff

10
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,929
Houston

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,240
thank you everyone my name is Jeff

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:45,800
Houston I'm with a penis

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,600
I play with numbers you know I have to

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,260
thanks God I lived through a lot of that

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,810
myself

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,430
and I must admit at the time I had no

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,980
idea what was going on it was all a blur

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,190
I was even on that international ad-hoc

19
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:01,250
committee I I remember it most going to

20
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,720
a meeting in January in Geneva and there

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,489
are many places on the planet that you

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,800
can go to in various times of the year

23
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,740
don't go to Geneva in January it's

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,970
really cold but beyond that I'm not sure

25
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,580
I learned much this talk is quite

26
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,550
different to Scots this is actually a

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,200
talk that I hope is a lot nearer and

28
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,570
dearer to your hearts if you're running

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,940
an ISP if you're in the peering in

30
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,809
transit business and this is actually a

31
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,429
talk about connectivity you see although

32
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,050
the Internet is not the telephone

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,910
network and as Scott said it's it's

34
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,820
built in a remarkably different way

35
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:40,220
different players totally different

36
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,979
regulatory structure from the sort of

37
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,350
superficial aspect we're in the same

38
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:50,270
business we're in the business of

39
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:53,690
communications and interestingly 140 odd

40
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:57,170
years of telephony created a number of

41
00:01:53,690 --> 00:02:00,380
points of ethos what we regard is

42
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:04,130
essential for a public communications

43
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,949
network and one of them was an almost an

44
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:10,609
unconscious thing if I had a telephone

45
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:13,870
and you had a telephone we could ring

46
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:17,000
each other there's nothing stopping it

47
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,160
all telephones are were equally

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,780
reachable now in the early days that

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,310
wasn't the case you know your telephone

50
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,260
company didn't talk to mine and so on

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,360
and so forth but in the massive

52
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,239
reforming of the telephone business in

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,640
the early parts of the 20th century the

54
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:36,650
emergence of a TT in the inter in in the

55
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:38,720
u.s. one company one service one realm

56
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,340
of connectivity and then when

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,670
international subscriber darling came

58
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,350
along they became a global commitment

59
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,140
that your telephone company talked to my

60
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,430
telephone company your phone call my

61
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,859
phone and vice versa

62
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,290
anyone could

63
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,230
dile anyone else and we think that's

64
00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:01,989
something we need yeah so when we look

65
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:05,679
at the Internet is that the case when I

66
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,870
turn my Macintosh laptop into a web

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,740
server right here and now can all of you

68
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,900
reach it can the world reach it are all

69
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,080
these connected endpoints equally

70
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,050
reachable as per our expectations of

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,570
telephony because the internet we

72
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:26,920
thought we were building mimicked

73
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:29,920
telephony all of these IP addresses are

74
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,549
equally routed and all of them are

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,769
equally reachable aren't they you meant

76
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,810
to say yes at this point because that's

77
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,610
what we expect we're building that's why

78
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,290
you go to all this trouble with peering

79
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,330
and bringing up up streams and creating

80
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,920
connectivity and trying to grab all

81
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,650
these routes because you're trying to

82
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,559
actually get Universal connectivity yes

83
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,120
well you know the first point is all

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,770
connected endpoints aren't equally

85
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,260
reachable and you know that as well as I

86
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,980
do because everybody runs Nats and

87
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,170
firewalls

88
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,179
because all of a sudden the peer-to-peer

89
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,369
network that we were building a long

90
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,850
long time ago is not the network we have

91
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,890
now we shifted huge amounts of the

92
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:12,489
internet into client-server based

93
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,380
architectures so all of a sudden this is

94
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,470
now a different network to the network

95
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,950
we had if you're a client people can't

96
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:23,830
get to you but the theory goes still and

97
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:27,099
we still fervently believe that if you

98
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,840
are a server if you stand up a service

99
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,910
on port 80 or maybe that's just

100
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,859
old-fashioned you stand up a service on

101
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,940
port 443 and you sit it outside of a NAT

102
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,500
then everyone can reach you right

103
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,570
because at least we've managed to

104
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,250
salvage that little bit of the universe

105
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,409
of connectivity ethos yes

106
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,900
maybe that's the new internet we want

107
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,840
now that no matter who you get your

108
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:53,429
transit service from it's equally good

109
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,770
and that everyone can get to it yep

110
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,620
yes well this is what you expect right

111
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,870
and so I'm kind of looking at this you

112
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,830
know even if all these points aren't

113
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,470
equally the same all the server

114
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:10,280
can everyone reach all the servers well

115
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:12,710
I'm kind of wondering about this and you

116
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,479
start to look for evidence because what

117
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,409
I'm trying to see is is that really the

118
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,560
case can I reach everywhere

119
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:23,919
now to digress a little bit I do a lot

120
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,479
of internet measurement because it's fun

121
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,419
and Google helped me a lot Thank You

122
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,568
Google because one of the things that

123
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:35,870
gets you to run code on everybody's

124
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:38,750
browsers all of the time is Google's ad

125
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:42,349
network now Google might do a lot of

126
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:45,680
things and they do 97% of their revenue

127
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:49,009
comes from advertising so they really

128
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,860
really worry about ads they try and make

129
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:55,069
sure that as an advertiser you get

130
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,900
precisely the eyeballs you're after so

131
00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:00,080
when I come along to Google and say I

132
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,638
want to see everybody they're really

133
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,099
really good they go off chasing

134
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,069
everybody because that's who I asked for

135
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:08,690
Thank You Google they're fantastic the

136
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,460
other thing about Google which I really

137
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,349
love like any advertisers is that you

138
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:19,969
only pay for clicks if you see that ad

139
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:23,690
for God's sake don't click just let it

140
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:25,520
go right the code will always run on an

141
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,159
impression if you click I pay more

142
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,940
that's a bad thing so what comes this ad

143
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:34,849
what does this ad do well all ads have

144
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,069
code in them all of them they make the

145
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:39,349
mouse go funny they highlight stuff they

146
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:42,590
watch you all ads are loaded with html5

147
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,969
so is ours and that's what it's loaded

148
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,029
with a collection of I think that's

149
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:50,840
about 12 in there URLs that your browser

150
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:55,009
fetches they all point at servers that I

151
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:58,818
run and the servers that I run run peak

152
00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:02,060
app and capture everything so I'm seeing

153
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:06,680
a total log of what folk do when they

154
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:09,409
try and fetch those URLs so that

155
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,370
constantly records so that's a lot of

156
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:15,020
activity we do around 5 to 7 million

157
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,210
separate experiments a day Thank You

158
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,870
Google and it doesn't cost a lot

159
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,669
no one clicks on the ad great love it so

160
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,849
we see a lot of the internet the other

161
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:28,159
thing Google really do if you notice is

162
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:31,400
that certainly as an advertiser they try

163
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,319
to deliver fresh eyeballs so the seven

164
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,120
million I see tomorrow are not the same

165
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,770
as the ones today and the ones after

166
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,470
that are different and so on and so

167
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,870
forth so you get to see all parts of the

168
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,389
internet from the Faroe Islands through

169
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,430
to somewhere deep in Zimbabwe we even

170
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,979
get ads in Australia no matter where you

171
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,320
are even in China and even in North

172
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:54,289
Korea you find that someone's watching

173
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,880
YouTube ads come up sooner or later we

174
00:07:54,289 --> 00:08:01,460
get to see most of the internet

175
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:06,530
eventually so that's what we see one

176
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:08,570
part of this ad is a TCP connection now

177
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,570
some of you did this whole protocol

178
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:14,690
dynamic stuff remember that and you

179
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,819
might recall that the initial part of

180
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:21,139
making a connection is a three-way

181
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:25,370
handshake the client sends me the server

182
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:28,580
and open it's called a sin so I see that

183
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,280
packet I respond with an acknowledgment

184
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,500
of that sin and send my own magic number

185
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,140
called a syn ACK and I'm waiting for an

186
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,380
ACK and then we go off and do the whole

187
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,620
HTTP dance and we all have a good time

188
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:46,640
but sometimes I only see the one packet

189
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:51,880
I see an incoming sin comes to my server

190
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,880
I send the syn ACK nothing happens so

191
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:59,180
I'm kind of interested in that and I

192
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:04,930
started to measure them now anyone

193
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:08,739
running 6to4 good because it sucks

194
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:10,599
it's failure rate is around 10% so you

195
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,509
know if you hate your customers run six

196
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:19,059
to four it's just horrible it really is

197
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:21,399
the protocol from hell you've I P v6

198
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,410
itself the average failure rate isn't

199
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,800
ten percent but it's still pretty bad

200
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:31,240
the failure rate of ipv6 these days is

201
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,508
1.5 percent now as I said before we have

202
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,179
this ethos from telephony yeah Universal

203
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:40,600
connectivity was one of them five nines

204
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:42,490
is the other anyone down there in

205
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,139
engineering knows that your target for

206
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:49,420
availability is 99.999% sort of one day

207
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:50,920
in ten years outage at most that's what

208
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,259
you're striving to do because it's

209
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,559
connectivity this is a public service it

210
00:09:53,259 --> 00:10:00,939
needs to be up v6 runs a one nine

211
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,410
service because that's not 99 percent

212
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:05,439
that's ninety eight point five one nine

213
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,879
service you couldn't run a commercial

214
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,689
service with that kind of failure rate

215
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:13,360
but that's what v6 delivers and the only

216
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:16,649
reason why this is not a complete

217
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,230
disaster is thank God for dual stack

218
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:22,990
because v4 saves you because every

219
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,639
single time this v6 connection fails v4

220
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,800
comes along goes yeah that's fine I'll

221
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,110
pull you out of that hole that's an

222
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,378
astonishingly big failure rate and you

223
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:36,249
kind of wonder why are we building such

224
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:39,160
a shitty Network now truly how can you

225
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:41,019
make one nine a target because it's not

226
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,910
a target believe me you might be

227
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,620
professionals you might be good at what

228
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:49,089
you do but one nine is not what you're

229
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,490
trying for so why now some of its Auto

230
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:54,220
tunneling you know even 6id isn't

231
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:57,100
brilliant don't do this stuff a lot of

232
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,299
it is lousy CPE you know the Internet of

233
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,179
Things is upon us

234
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:02,110
the things that we have already crap

235
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,490
building more of them isn't going to

236
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,259
help you but we seem to believe somehow

237
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,839
the twenty billion of them will make

238
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:10,029
like that it won't and by the way most

239
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,819
of you can't program firewalls you know

240
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,519
you just can't so a lot of that is the

241
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:18,849
problem down at the end but when you

242
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:22,690
think about it you kind of go well

243
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:25,089
we're doing such a lousy job in v6 are

244
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,120
we doing any better in v4 cuz like I

245
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:31,959
said thank God for dual snack but is the

246
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:36,040
v4 side of the equation working it's not

247
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:38,579
five nines it's gone from one nine to

248
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,930
two nines because you're professionals

249
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,609
so you're getting around ninety nine

250
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,560
percent but it's only ninety nine point

251
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,050
eight percent there is still this

252
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,630
astonishing one in five hundred failure

253
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,630
rate and when you see failure rate like

254
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:55,439
that that's steady and consistent but

255
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:58,269
everyday I'm sampling different people

256
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,910
it's a new seven million the next day

257
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,779
and I'm seeing this really consistent

258
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,519
level of underlying connection failure

259
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:11,230
something structurally is broken in this

260
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:14,380
network hmm so I don't think it's in any

261
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,839
Auto tunneling I don't really think it's

262
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,550
shocking CPE I'm like maybe it is but if

263
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,649
you can't do four why are you selling a

264
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,000
product and you know I would have

265
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,470
thought you've got your firewalls right

266
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,019
for v4 because if you haven't got them

267
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,300
right you're not seeing anything so it's

268
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,670
not the reasons why we say the six is

269
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,689
busted we can't say it's someone else's

270
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,339
fault it's our fault so then I go to the

271
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:38,939
next thing that kind of binds us all

272
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:41,290
together what makes this one internet

273
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:44,680
rather than lots of little internets

274
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:47,889
what makes it cohesive it's the routing

275
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,589
system so let's look at the routing

276
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:52,209
system now there are two massive

277
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:53,560
projects out there in the world which

278
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:57,189
have been going on for some time which

279
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,079
are brilliant for this kind of work one

280
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:01,569
of them is University of Oregon's route

281
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,729
views with David Myer and it's fantastic

282
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:05,529
and the other one is the wrist routing

283
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:10,209
information service won by right the

284
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:14,279
ripe NCC so I just looked at the history

285
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:18,479
of the number of routes advertised

286
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:23,500
towards those two route collectors since

287
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,329
1994 and as you see there's a lot of

288
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,189
data inside those graphs and extends

289
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:29,150
over a lot of time the entire history of

290
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:31,459
the Internet is written there

291
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,670
even including the great internet bust

292
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:39,260
of the year 2001 ever remember that you

293
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:41,240
can even see the the bust of 2008 2009

294
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,220
if you look hard enough so you know a

295
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,950
lot of data is hidden there but let's

296
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:51,520
just blow this up over the last 18

297
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:55,130
months you don't have the same internet

298
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,050
every single peer is advertising a

299
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:00,220
subtly different collection of routes

300
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,719
and there's actually two bands there

301
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,010
over in America because you've got to do

302
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,750
things bigger and better than the rest

303
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:10,910
of us consistently you're seeing another

304
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:14,000
50,000 routes more than anyone else down

305
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,650
in Europe is slightly less the risk

306
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,570
collection is the band at the bottom

307
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:21,079
from ripe the route views is the band

308
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:24,190
above it the variance is a hundred

309
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:28,310
thousand routes and we already have

310
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:31,340
600,000 so that's pretty amazing that we

311
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:34,520
see astonishingly different views of the

312
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:39,740
same internet focus seeing different

313
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,360
networks and you kind of go well maybe

314
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,310
it's just more specifics because

315
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,920
everyone does traffic engineering in BGP

316
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,540
because a you can be it's cheap and it's

317
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,550
great to make your problem somebody

318
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,250
else's so to stuff it in the routing

319
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,990
table if you can't put it in the DNS and

320
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,930
your problem solve right well obviously

321
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:59,540
that's why you're here so the thing that

322
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,609
I'm kind of wondering about is well ok

323
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,000
you're playing with address virtus mints

324
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:07,130
are you playing with basic connectivity

325
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,010
other addresses that are reachable by

326
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:13,220
some and not by others so this is the

327
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:17,630
same data looking at the total address

328
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:20,390
space peer and is pretty clear you don't

329
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,970
see one Internet it's pretty clear that

330
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,280
there's a slash 8 that changes 15

331
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,150
million addresses across each of those

332
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,850
peers so I can be in your routing table

333
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:35,930
and not in yours and we think that's ok

334
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:39,800
and if you look at that banding it

335
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:42,410
doesn't change whatever the problem is

336
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,329
you're not trying to fix it you know

337
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,980
even remotely thinking about fixing it

338
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,350
it's the same tomorrow will be the same

339
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:52,850
the day after because you're not looking

340
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:55,279
so everyone announces a subtly different

341
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,470
collection of addresses they agree to

342
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,810
within about 20 million addresses so you

343
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,820
know that's okay isn't it and it's

344
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,640
stable so no one's trying to fix it and

345
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:07,370
it's not a routing problem it's the way

346
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,779
in which you build default it's the way

347
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,510
in which you build your connectivity

348
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:14,959
tables around the edges they're

349
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,550
different but you know that was v4 and

350
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,109
that's old and that's all history and we

351
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,910
know one needs to be four anymore yadda

352
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,459
yadda yadda v6 is all bright and shiny

353
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,930
and all problems will be cured in v6

354
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:28,579
right Yeah right

355
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,319
you know we are consistent as an

356
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,880
industry we keep on making the same

357
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,220
mistakes because we're bloody good at it

358
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,320
and and this is the route views of v6

359
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,959
and it has exactly the same sort of sets

360
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,089
of issues and in fact I think the span

361
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,819
of address announcements is even greater

362
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:46,490
than in v4 the number of these six

363
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,220
routes varies by 2,300 and we're only

364
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,470
announcing you know 20,000 of them so

365
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,510
you know fantastic work everyone well

366
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,240
done and if I look at the number of

367
00:16:53,510 --> 00:17:00,380
addresses being announced again the core

368
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,390
variation is around 1,000 / 32 s so we

369
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,910
can't even get that right it's exactly

370
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,069
the same set of problems so then you go

371
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,890
well what is the Internet

372
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,270
I set up an ISP well obviously I'm

373
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,829
trying to tell my customers no matter

374
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,168
where you send your packets I can

375
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,149
deliver them I need to by default I need

376
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:19,640
to by service from transits and up

377
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:23,030
streams and beers I need to assemble a

378
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:26,350
full route set but I have no clue what

379
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:28,550
that means and neither do you

380
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:31,010
there's no default that we can agree on

381
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:34,010
obviously obviously you all have very

382
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:37,129
different views of what the fault is so

383
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,050
I decided to define my own so what I did

384
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,780
is I took the collection from route

385
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,610
views and RIS and said look if 2/3 of

386
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,160
the peers say they can reach an address

387
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:50,750
or put it in this magic bucket called

388
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,760
default and all the rest is not and then

389
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,520
I look at each individual peer saying

390
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,210
well

391
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,730
what extra routes do you have and what

392
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:03,000
addresses are you missing what's the

393
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,520
variance from the mean and that's the

394
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,530
same picture but this time taking for

395
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,020
each individual pia how many addresses

396
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,780
they have more than default and how many

397
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:16,740
they have less we will name the guilty

398
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,420
later but as you see a it's stable no

399
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,940
one tries to change the problem it

400
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,200
persists over time even if you magnify

401
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,180
it up it looks more like a Jackson

402
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,890
Pollock painting than anything else but

403
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,090
you still see this kind of stable

404
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:32,490
pattern of difference what about v6 well

405
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:34,889
think about v6 is when you advertise a /

406
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,720
20 it goes off the graph so you know

407
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,190
it's kind of hard to get the picture but

408
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,380
if you zoom in a lot you'll actually see

409
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,300
v6 is getting worse not better because

410
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,960
you know we can and we're good at our

411
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:48,899
job so who's doing this and why so I

412
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,210
started looking at this and certainly

413
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,990
there are some interesting answers Telia

414
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:57,360
net very big transit provider compared

415
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,480
to everyone else it's missing 45 million

416
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,800
v4 addresses in its route set I have no

417
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,720
idea why I'm not sure they even know

418
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,730
even level 3 is down by two and a half

419
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,070
million addresses and I'm not sure they

420
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,450
even know that they are and they're

421
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,820
certainly not trying to fix it because

422
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,820
they don't know it's a problem so if

423
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,040
you're on this list you should kind of

424
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,889
think about it a little bit going where

425
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:26,280
and why what is going on that this is

426
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,600
different from other people I did the

427
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,310
same for RIS if you're on that list

428
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,949
you're probably somewhere in Europe and

429
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,950
again it's kind of things are missing

430
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,610
I'm trying to think of one obvious one

431
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,680
level three again is missing two and a

432
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,889
half thousand I saw one there this is

433
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,720
the same in v6 so again even in v6 like

434
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,310
hurricane electric there's a bunch

435
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,950
that's missing and a bunch that's more

436
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:52,710
than the core so none of us can agree

437
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,690
what default should be the same in risk

438
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:58,680
from our VA I mean we see this across

439
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:01,260
the entire internet so it's structural

440
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,330
it's not a routing problem it's not a

441
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,580
ghost route it's not some artifact of

442
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,850
BGP

443
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,550
because I think

444
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,909
you guys assume something that isn't

445
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:16,240
true when you look at making a choice

446
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:17,620
between two up streams you kind of

447
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,300
assume they're offering you the same

448
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,219
route set because they're an upstream

449
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,860
they're offering default right so there

450
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,130
must be an equivalent an equivalent

451
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:32,860
offering they're not those defaults will

452
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:35,020
differ because default varies a s29 one

453
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:40,300
for you know who you are

454
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:43,450
NTT in in route views you advertise two

455
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:47,560
point eight oh eight million addresses

456
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:52,230
two million addresses in Europe you're

457
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,580
down a million same provider same AAS

458
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,610
subtly different routes fan to each of

459
00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:00,909
those collectors I have no idea what's

460
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:04,270
going on I hope they do but what it

461
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,010
really says is we're not sure that we

462
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:09,220
can actually understand what Universal

463
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,890
connectivity is all about and I suspect

464
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:15,250
that this is a very subtle form of

465
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:18,000
market failure because unlike the

466
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:21,220
telephone world unlike the whole

467
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,920
regulated an arbitrated connectivity

468
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,740
that telephony insisted upon in the

469
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,650
internet this is a market and there's no

470
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,720
global routing arbiter there's no way

471
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,120
that you can get all possible routes as

472
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,190
a regulated outcome because none of us

473
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,159
actually know what that is default is a

474
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,350
market outcome you buy services from a

475
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,990
transit and you kind of hope that it

476
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:46,959
kind of will get you everywhere but you

477
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,940
don't know and you kind of hope that if

478
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,260
you can't get somewhere your customers

479
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,210
will ring you up because after all

480
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:57,220
that's the folk you use for all of your

481
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,900
testing and so you advertise your route

482
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,430
into that upstream hoping that that

483
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,610
means that everyone else can reach you

484
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,960
you hope you have no idea you have no

485
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,110
clue that that's actually going to

486
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,690
happen because that's not an assured

487
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:14,350
outcome in the internet the edges aren't

488
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:17,110
good now I've seen talks by Randi on

489
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,669
this one talking about how the actual

490
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,240
use of a default route and routing

491
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,970
patches all this up

492
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,010
and the whole idea is that if you sit

493
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,760
inside a tier-one it really doesn't

494
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,340
matter anymore

495
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,379
because everyone points ad real default

496
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,439
route up further up the tree and you're

497
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,110
just fine that's fine if you're a

498
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,700
tier-one that's fine if you're Akamai

499
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,340
I'm not

500
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:44,300
I live further down the food chain with

501
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,959
my servers so what I see is two 9s

502
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,419
availability that of the internet I get

503
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,090
point two of a percent drop rate of folk

504
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,290
trying to see me and I kind of think

505
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,260
there's a certain amount of connectivity

506
00:22:54,290 --> 00:23:01,700
failure going on can I confirm that Wow

507
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:05,059
well again let's have a look at what's

508
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,850
going on here I see a syn I send back a

509
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:12,410
syn ACK it gets dropped right standard

510
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:16,010
stuff but what happens then is you get

511
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:18,800
back often a little message because ICMP

512
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,540
is my friend because whenever a packet

513
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,730
gets dropped because it's not in a

514
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,040
routing table the router will

515
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,110
occasionally if it's friendly send me

516
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,490
back a little note going you couldn't

517
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:34,459
get there Jeff and what I see is ICMP

518
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:38,420
destination unreachable right well I do

519
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,220
I see a fair few of them they don't

520
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,980
quite match the point two of a percent

521
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,600
because some folk like to filter ICMP

522
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,990
god knows why it's a helpful little

523
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,360
signal so what I see is destination

524
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:53,929
unreachable in the outer packet and the

525
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:58,850
inner packet is that syn ACK that never

526
00:23:53,929 --> 00:24:02,120
made it back that somewhere 80 4.41 dot

527
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:05,510
108 dot 74 thank you very much didn't

528
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,699
have a round 246 dot one sixty three dot

529
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,830
sixty three dot whatever and just

530
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,840
couldn't make it any further the packet

531
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:14,090
goes on the floor no one actually

532
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,070
manages to make it through and so

533
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,260
there's a fair deal of that going on in

534
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,300
the silence of the internet donut right

535
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:25,210
down at the packet level that you and I

536
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:27,950
can't see so the conclusion sort of is

537
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,600
that if we really think this is a

538
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,880
network that has Universal connectivity

539
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,510
we're kidding ourselves because it's

540
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,550
kind of two nines right

541
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,950
it's sort of well you know within two 9s

542
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,720
it's true but it's kind of almost anyone

543
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,270
can sort of almost get to Revere else

544
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,790
most of the time except those few people

545
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:49,500
up the back sorry about that didn't mean

546
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:54,379
it and no one complains you'll help this

547
00:24:49,500 --> 00:25:01,320
never ever ever gets the call why not

548
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:02,390
because nobody cares why because we're

549
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,760
not building a peer-to-peer network

550
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:09,330
anymore we stopped building that years

551
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,990
ago we're building Tier one theater

552
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:14,220
networks if you can't reach Google

553
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,160
you'll know about it

554
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,140
you'll help this will melt if you can't

555
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,070
reach out on my Netflix Facebook and all

556
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,340
the rest of them

557
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:25,139
you'll help this will melt and you will

558
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,169
know there's a problem and you would

559
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,810
have fixed it because that's your money

560
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:33,030
so if you're working towards feeding

561
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:35,940
tier ones you know where your job is and

562
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:38,820
you will fix it and so the network we

563
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,280
have today is a subtly different network

564
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,919
from telephony or maybe it's not so

565
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,350
subtle maybe it's quite brutal because

566
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,650
the network we have today is a CDN

567
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:52,770
feeder system a system that feeds your

568
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:56,250
clients in towards concentrated points

569
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:59,550
of content very very well and acutely

570
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:01,650
well really reliably your customers are

571
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:04,889
looked after facing towards the tier

572
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:07,770
ones and coming back but talking between

573
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:10,350
ourselves what we used to think the

574
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:13,620
internet was all about is becoming

575
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:15,780
increasingly not a goal it's not

576
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,280
something we're trying to build it's not

577
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,129
an outcome we're actually trying to

578
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,560
engineer anymore the network we are

579
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,990
building is now a unidirectional network

580
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,830
that points up towards tier ones and

581
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:30,740
back and that's it now for an old fart

582
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,720
such as myself that kind of makes me sad

583
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,740
because you know I kind of thought we

584
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,450
could do better than that

585
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,430
I actually thought if we could do better

586
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,340
than telephony that we could take that

587
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,830
ethos and make it even better we can't

588
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,600
we don't seem to be doing that

589
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,279
and you know maybe I just have to get

590
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,959
with the times and accept it that if I

591
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,570
really want my content to be seen by

592
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,240
everyone I need to buy my services from

593
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:57,360
a tier 1 CDN because I can't do it

594
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,690
myself anymore because not everyone can

595
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,780
see me and not everyone can see you

596
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,160
thank you
