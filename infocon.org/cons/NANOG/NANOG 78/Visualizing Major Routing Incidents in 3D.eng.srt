1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
all right another talk on routing leaks

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,560
this is what I think is a different

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,430
enough that you might find this

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,459
interesting

5
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,379
so this is a talk titled visually

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,469
visualizing routing leaks in three

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,080
dimensional we dimensions no glasses

8
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:20,180
needed so I'm Doug Midori from Oracle

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,380
and gonna talk a little about how I

10
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,119
think about some of these routing

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,538
incidents and how we can maybe better

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,070
communicate them because I think there's

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,980
some limitations of how we speak about

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,719
them and you know you know in full

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,660
disclosure this is as much as self

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,030
criticism as it is cruises anyone else

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,260
I too have written a lot about submarine

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:48,890
cable sorry so routing leaks over the

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:51,539
years and I use the same kind of

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,850
shorthand to talk about the scale of

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,800
these routing leaks using prefixes

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,960
account as we see like in these two

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,108
incidents here so this is the thing on

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,559
the left here is a screenshot from some

25
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,720
coverage of the Allegheny networks for

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,009
eyes and routing leak that affected

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,200
CloudFlare we heard referred about that

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,850
a couple times now the one on the left

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,710
the safe post at China Telecom routing

30
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,669
leak we heard from a luca in the

31
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,169
coverage we see that these you know the

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,939
way we talk about these routing leaks is

33
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,909
that we've got you know sets numbers of

34
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,619
prefixes so the one on the left is more

35
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,840
than 20,000 prefixes one of the rise

36
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,520
more than 70,000 I guess I'm here to say

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,860
that these are just there's there's some

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,360
weaknesses in these numbers that we want

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,210
to that's caught with a way to do this

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,460
better to communicate some of the

41
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,289
nuances that are evident and the

42
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,770
propagation of these routing leaks so

43
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,140
here are the weaknesses for one when we

44
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,869
talk about these you know single

45
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,909
one-dimensional metrics not every leak

46
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,950
is propagated to the same number of a s

47
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,130
across the Internet

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,880
not every leak is in circulation same

49
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,009
amount of time

50
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,500
in fact there every one of these

51
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,180
incidents many of the leaks actually

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,970
don't propagate very far and many of

53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,920
them don't last very long and yet are

54
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,930
added to this previous count list and

55
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,260
served to either

56
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,700
one could argue to inflate the number or

57
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,370
even just make it kind of almost to a

58
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,810
certain extent meaningless and as we'll

59
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,159
see on some of these visualizations they

60
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:29,730
see that there's always like a very long

61
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:33,078
tail of four prefixes that didn't that

62
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,819
don't go very far and I think at a

63
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:38,340
internet level you know where this is

64
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,048
internet level analysis we can argue

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,180
that most of those prefixes had

66
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:46,169
negligible impact operational impact on

67
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,480
the internet so there's got to be a

68
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:52,230
better way so what I propose in this

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,939
analysis technique is to integrate these

70
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,679
other dimensions of duration and

71
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,870
propagation into how we think about

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,459
grouting leaks or largely it could be or

73
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,469
even any kind of routing large routing

74
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:08,250
incident today the topic is about leaks

75
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:10,530
specifically so in this in these three

76
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,329
dimensions we've got a dimension of just

77
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,480
the the set of prefixes it got touched

78
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:19,139
to any extent just to have them in one

79
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,159
axis sorted by how much propagation kind

80
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,540
of like the high-water mark of

81
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,150
propagation for each of these prefixes

82
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,448
another axis is time we kind of know how

83
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,609
that works and then the last is

84
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:32,159
propagation and the way we assess

85
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,930
propagation is look at our hundreds of

86
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,358
bgp sources and figure out what's the

87
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,669
percentage of our sources to picked up

88
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:43,829
throughout the leaked version of the

89
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:45,840
route at that time and so then if we

90
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,879
followed that explanation then if there

91
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,120
was a routing leak that somehow achieved

92
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,759
you know total global route propagation

93
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,319
during the period of the leak for all

94
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,589
the prefixes then you'd have a solid

95
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:02,488
block but that never that never takes

96
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,709
place in fact this is what this is the

97
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:07,079
visualization of our analysis of the

98
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,509
allegheny to Verizon yeah I'll give you

99
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,569
the Verizon leak that's was touched on

100
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:15,839
in the previous two talks and I hope

101
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:19,918
you'll agree with me that there's a lot

102
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,750
to be said for trying to look at it in

103
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,270
this perspective to understand where is

104
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,780
the impact here in this routing leak

105
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:30,520
because

106
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:32,289
were the the reporting and the previous

107
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,510
analyses to talk about you know tens of

108
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,889
thousands of prefixes when we look at

109
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,380
what were the previous except we've got

110
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,110
propagated pretty far it was really just

111
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,750
a few hundred and it was arguably maybe

112
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,060
just one percent or so of the total set

113
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,950
caused the problems and that's where we

114
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,660
ought to focus our issue our attention

115
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,680
to make sure we're focusing on the right

116
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,389
thing to clean this kind of behavior up

117
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,950
so out of after this incident there was

118
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,960
a lot of discussion around how are peak

119
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:02,200
I could have assisted here and I don't

120
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,510
disagree I'm on board but I think it's

121
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,710
worth running the numbers just to make

122
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,349
sure we know we're honest to ourselves

123
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,680
what what precisely would that have done

124
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:14,800
for us out of this league of you know

125
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,690
about twenty nine thousand prefixes the

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,310
vast majority would have been RPI

127
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,910
unknown we're still working on trying to

128
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,290
get more row as created that's an

129
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,680
ongoing issues a lot of progress made

130
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:29,800
but we are where we are the next highest

131
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,690
category would have been valid so one

132
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,570
thing that's important to note in the in

133
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:37,600
this incident that was exacerbated by

134
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:40,150
the use of a route optimizer a leak from

135
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,370
a route optimizer preserves the origin

136
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,349
and the a s path so you're not gonna

137
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,180
have a new origin or that's not going to

138
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,550
be the it's not gonna be invalid s and

139
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,789
due to the route optimizer so there

140
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:55,930
actually was many more RP guide valid

141
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:57,849
routes then there were invalid and then

142
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,110
for the two different invalid categories

143
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,580
this invalid length that's really where

144
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,560
okay could have done a lot of didn't

145
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,750
done a lot of good will mention that in

146
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,419
a second the last categories invalid

147
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,160
asns and I just said that the route

148
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:16,180
optimizer doesn't change the origin and

149
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,150
ass path these are these are just routes

150
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,710
that are invalid all the time they are

151
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,950
misconfigured row is that are always

152
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,169
anytime they cross somebody who's going

153
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,030
to drop an invalid they are going to be

154
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,729
classified as invalid ASM that's just

155
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,280
unfortunately there's some number of

156
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:36,190
these that always exist so back to the

157
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,239
invalid length you know Martin did the

158
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,289
talk

159
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,210
got it earlier about you know how caught

160
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:45,818
fire got affected by this and clapper

161
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,198
would have been had these routes been

162
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,340
dropped that they would haven't spared

163
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,729
and maybe we wouldn't all be talking

164
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,729
about this the only reason that is true

165
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:56,590
is because of the max prefix length set

166
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,740
on those rowers so that's an important

167
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,919
point if you're hoping to use our Pio to

168
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,780
defend yourself against this kind of a

169
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,448
leak you're gonna have to have that max

170
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,650
prefix length set as an exact match of

171
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:10,599
the route you're trying to protect

172
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,049
because if it's one bit more than a

173
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:16,930
route optimizer has gotten room to

174
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:22,780
insert a more specific and it did you

175
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:24,160
know good so I've written a number of

176
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:28,539
these over the years of the you know

177
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,940
best decade of autopsies or after

178
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:34,060
actions about these routing routing

179
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,919
instance for my time as renesis and

180
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,599
Undine research and now it's Oracle

181
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,039
internet intelligence and there's a

182
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,560
there it can be a little bit formulaic

183
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,810
so it's how many prefixes were involved

184
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,159
what were the a s is you know when did

185
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,320
it start when did it end and then some

186
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:49,650
highlights of what were the impacts and

187
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,460
I guess having done this for a while I

188
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,138
decided you know there's probably a way

189
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,549
we could just automate this honestly

190
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,409
because you can just use script this out

191
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,050
and it would pass on the same amount of

192
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,729
information I also from people who know

193
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,050
me often people will reach out to me

194
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,729
directly and say hey what were the

195
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,680
prefixes involved here and what was it

196
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:08,020
or the extent of the impact for them and

197
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,460
so I'll write run something but you know

198
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,219
this doesn't scale the email doesn't

199
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,620
scale not everybody can be my friend and

200
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:18,849
so this is a way that we can kind of

201
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,469
communicate a you know the the ops ops

202
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:22,360
you have one of these incidents in an

203
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:27,370
automated way that's consistent across

204
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,199
different different events and I hope

205
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,169
it's informative and I hope it's it's

206
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,579
kind of a new way to look at these types

207
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,890
of events so we've gone back and down

208
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:36,640
about a hundred events in the last few

209
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,770
years

210
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,729
generated these interactive

211
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:45,069
three-dimensional visualizations and the

212
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,720
criteria was a little bit arbitrary I

213
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,949
need to be more than about 100 prefixes

214
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,089
involved unless it was like really

215
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:53,139
noteworthy

216
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,790
and about 10% of our bgp sources because

217
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,439
otherwise there is a lot of low-lying

218
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,670
noise that we don't want to we want to

219
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:59,589
try to come up with some things that had

220
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,040
some sort of potential impact for

221
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:05,559
disruption and then yeah we intend to

222
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,990
add more going back in a few in the past

223
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,670
and then invariably when there's more

224
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,920
incidents into the future we want to

225
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,910
have this to be a place where there's

226
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,709
been that there's been an incident

227
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,660
instead of people try and email Doug

228
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:19,660
maybe there's a place that we can I can

229
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,129
just want to make this analysis and then

230
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,959
publish this as soon as we can

231
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:25,300
I can't guarantee this is within minutes

232
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,229
of the incident but we hope to do that

233
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:32,410
in a timely manner that's the vision all

234
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:34,059
right so if you're on this site then

235
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,740
here's here's just a quick walk through

236
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:38,139
the features so we're trying to be able

237
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,459
to slice and dice or decompose one of

238
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:41,019
these incidents to try to understand

239
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:43,989
what were the versions of the routes

240
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,579
that were impacted what were the the GR

241
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,730
like a geography of the countries

242
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:50,709
because that ends up being a topic of

243
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,079
discussion and I'd like to have a better

244
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:54,790
a more informed discussion around what

245
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,579
were where were the impacts were and

246
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:02,079
where they kind of were not another

247
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:03,939
maybe concept here is this idea of

248
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,239
impact and impact here we're just

249
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:11,309
strictly looking at aggregate aggregate

250
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:14,379
propagation or as measured as just the

251
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:17,350
area or the volume under this under the

252
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:19,569
surface of the area under the curve and

253
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,639
that just serves as a way of just trying

254
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:24,219
to figure out how much propagation in

255
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,800
total did one incident

256
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,480
exhibit versus another and if we have

257
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,800
that those methodologies be consistent

258
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,779
then we can kind of compare from one one

259
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,378
independent one one incident to another

260
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:41,319
figure out what had more more

261
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:45,040
propagation in total it was a bigger bgp

262
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:46,599
incident so with those tools then we can

263
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,699
go back and revisit things in the past

264
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,029
this is a kind of a pet peeve of mine is

265
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:54,639
this China Telecom incident from 2010

266
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,720
it's almost 10 years ago and so there

267
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,420
was a bunch of coverage along these

268
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,970
lines of you know China swallowed 50% of

269
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,360
the the

270
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,620
and in this body and then I'll go know

271
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,029
when this these headlights came out

272
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,639
people kind of like you know poopoo disk

273
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:10,490
is kind of ridiculous on a lot of levels

274
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,050
and you know I thought for a long time

275
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,990
this was kind of put to bed but honestly

276
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,329
if you look in national security US

277
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:21,920
national security writing this is still

278
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:23,329
quoted as you know like a fact and like

279
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,089
it's worth revisiting now that we have

280
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:27,739
this different approach and just really

281
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:29,629
poke some holes into this so for one

282
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,089
obviously the biggest the biggest issue

283
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:35,569
is rats don't equal traffic I think

284
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:38,120
that's can be we can agree on that but

285
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:40,099
let's just say routes equal traffic or

286
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,439
maybe the headline was 15 percent of the

287
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,459
routes were you know taken over total

288
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,660
for 18 minutes

289
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:48,349
somehow to try to make that a little

290
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,839
more correct it's still not an accurate

291
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,339
assessment so in this case if this were

292
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,860
true there were 50 percent of the routes

293
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:56,420
was about 50,000 routes so that was 15

294
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,699
percent I was a little more on 300,000

295
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,069
routes at the time they were these were

296
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:02,750
totally hijacked then they would have to

297
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:05,089
be you know a hundred percent global

298
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,670
propagation unless we're gonna start

299
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:10,009
discounting you know in that dimension

300
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,660
as well and so you need to have like we

301
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:14,480
mentioned earlier such as like solid

302
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,439
block of propagation in reality it

303
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,139
wasn't anywhere close and if we were to

304
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:25,040
run they run the data through this

305
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:27,769
analysis we can see that there's a again

306
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:32,029
it's a very common pattern here this

307
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:33,709
long tail of a minority of a fraction of

308
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:35,689
prefixes they get propagate very far and

309
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,878
then a long tail to get touched they

310
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:41,589
don't go very far or don't last that

311
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:45,949
long if you were if you break this into

312
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:47,870
you know by by country we can see that

313
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:50,540
the impact actually was far greater on

314
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,639
other Chinese routes than it were on US

315
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,569
routes which is what people still get

316
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:59,089
been out of shape about in fact on this

317
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:02,029
table on the left this is from the from

318
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:04,279
the site will we kind of have this this

319
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:07,970
absolutely impact that's the area under

320
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:09,800
the area under the curve so the the

321
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,689
Chinese brows accounted for 74 percent

322
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,620
of the total propagation so the vast

323
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:15,260
majority of it was

324
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,570
just self-inflicted that's for eleven

325
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,310
thousand rounds about sixteen thousand

326
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,960
rounds for us and they only kind of

327
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,989
provide eight percent of the total

328
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,550
aggregation for a total propagation this

329
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,280
total curb is only about four percent

330
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,990
four point six percent of the total you

331
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,120
have theoretical max what was the total

332
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,190
box that this three-dimensional space

333
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,740
would have taken up it's only about four

334
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:41,510
point six percent that's how much it

335
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,100
takes up so if we were to add all these

336
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,280
discounts and we're look talking about

337
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,720
0.07% of route propagation as I'm

338
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,670
getting pretty small for just focusing

339
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,070
on the u.s. portion the only exception

340
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:56,060
to this are a handful of US prefixes

341
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:58,010
that were widely the leaked versions

342
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,739
were widely propagated and that was a

343
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,700
result of how they can be prepending of

344
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,650
the these a SS they kind of basically

345
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,570
set themselves up for hijacking they had

346
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,100
a a single upstream that they had

347
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,140
heavily had pretended to and when the

348
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,970
leaker came along most of the internet

349
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,220
believed the leaker because the religion

350
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:20,900
and the origin hadn't had a ridiculously

351
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:23,840
long a.s path so here's a couple other

352
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,579
incidents and we can go back and look at

353
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,040
so this is one this is the end of sat

354
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:32,810
leak of hundreds of thousands of routes

355
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,760
back in 2014 when in reality it's a bit

356
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,550
more bimodal right there's just just

357
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,830
this one set of maybe about 8,000

358
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,170
prefixes that went everywhere and then

359
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,090
an extremely long tail that went almost

360
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,339
nowhere so if we were to communicate

361
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,590
this type of incident we don't want to

362
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,530
have a single metric to to convey this

363
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,300
because this kind of you're gonna assume

364
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,699
these are all equally impacted when in

365
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:59,630
reality it's probably more accurate to

366
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:01,040
call this an 8000 a prefix routing

367
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,580
League versus a four hundred eighty

368
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,280
seven thousand prefix rotting League if

369
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,720
we compare that to the following year we

370
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,970
have another very large-scale

371
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,970
routing leak this is a telecom Lygia

372
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,760
this one is a little bit bigger and so

373
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,500
the difference is we can look at that we

374
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,980
look at the compare the absolute impacts

375
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:26,170
the areas under the curves just telecom

376
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:29,149
lazy leak from 2015 was

377
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:33,639
evolved half as many prefixes but had

378
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:36,440
six times as much aggregate propagation

379
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:38,540
because this was you can see you can see

380
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,570
it visually that this this curve has got

381
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:46,730
a lot more meat to it that was um higher

382
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:48,100
impactful more impactful incident so

383
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:53,420
from running through a bunch of these

384
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:57,350
I've got you know a few observations

385
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:01,760
that I can can make so where are the

386
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:03,380
where the problems exists are in these

387
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,240
leaks or basic what are the prefixes

388
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,120
that were widely propagated so why are

389
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,660
why do these small sets of prefixes get

390
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,769
widely propagated there's typically

391
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,209
there one of these three reasons there's

392
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:15,769
a more specific of an existing route

393
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:18,138
either it's generated by a route

394
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:18,800
optimizer as we heard in the previous

395
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:21,709
talks

396
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,420
we're also these come from traffic

397
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,469
engineering so if there's a routing leak

398
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,729
and there's a lot of more specifics that

399
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,089
doesn't automatically mean or route

400
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,970
optimizer was involved if you recall the

401
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:34,220
level three leak from November 2017 this

402
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,720
was a case where companies like Comcast

403
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,279
and elkanah that we're announcing a lot

404
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,880
of more specifics into level three

405
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,339
they try to influence return traffic

406
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,750
when that when that leaked out and added

407
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:46,519
tens of thousands of more specifics into

408
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,339
their global routing table no Route

409
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,230
atomizer was involved yet that was that

410
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:53,839
was what was the most damaging part of

411
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,420
that that incident another incident

412
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,209
another another type of route that seems

413
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,310
to cause problems are these regional

414
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:03,859
routes or routes that have intentionally

415
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:07,129
limited their propagation and the case

416
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:10,099
of the safe post routing leak the luca

417
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,199
talked about they went through trying to

418
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,809
telecom the european mobile carriers

419
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,000
that got whacked there the reason how

420
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:18,410
they really got whacked was that they

421
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,559
limit their the propagation of their

422
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,419
routes to western europe they announced

423
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,689
more specifics and then just parts of

424
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:27,709
western europe when the leaker starts

425
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:29,330
announcing these to the rest of the

426
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,890
internet there's nothing for them for

427
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,139
the that route to contend with and it

428
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,120
just just fills in the void and it takes

429
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,590
over and then i'm cause it's damaged so

430
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,610
it's something to consider if you've got

431
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,010
that as a part of your routing strategy

432
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,379
yeah I don't consider what happens when

433
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:46,680
a routing leak occurs and the rest of

434
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,840
the internet starts to use this more

435
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,180
specific that you've announced just to a

436
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,449
part of the Internet and then yeah my

437
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:59,040
I've got a new foot stopper here the dew

438
00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:01,020
on excess of prepending with yeah in any

439
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,120
of these cases any of these leaks we've

440
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,210
talked about today the old ones in this

441
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,699
out and Telekom Malaysia on up to the

442
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,190
Allegheny networks rise and some of

443
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,650
these routes that get propagated the

444
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:17,010
farthest by route optimizers are due to

445
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:20,640
excessive prepending that basically

446
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:26,970
serves no purpose but just adds as risk

447
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:29,280
to the legitimate origin so to wrap up

448
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,040
here i think i hope i made my case i

449
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,700
think the the dimensions of propagation

450
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,680
and duration would improve if we can add

451
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,140
these into the discussion of routing

452
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,420
links would improve our understanding of

453
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,750
how these things take place and how they

454
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,670
actually disrupt traffic we need a

455
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,160
better metric than just simple prefix

456
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,300
count and like I said I'm I'm as guilty

457
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,380
as anybody I've written have been

458
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,450
written eight writing about these for a

459
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,490
long time I'm in here

460
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:01,710
in part to absolve myself of sins and

461
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:03,000
know what's the suggestion you know we

462
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,670
can come up with something like it's got

463
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,570
to be more than one person of peering

464
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:13,560
sources or greater than ten bgp sources

465
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:15,960
not all of us use the same same data so

466
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,720
that's mix of some kind makes it

467
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,970
problematic to copy the common

468
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,740
percentage threshold a more esoteric

469
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,660
suggestion would be to try to could we

470
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,810
make use of this area under the curve as

471
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:31,020
a stand-in for a Richter Victor scale of

472
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,520
just agar impact that we kind of neat

473
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,440
but is a little bit kind of hard to get

474
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,210
your mind around some of these pinball

475
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:42,060
numbers of just how big one of these

476
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:46,440
incidences I am totally on board with

477
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:47,700
RPI would do a lot to try to contain

478
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,650
these incidents obviously they're going

479
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,770
to continue to happen as people humans

480
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:54,559
make mistakes on routers

481
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:58,250
I would check check your max prefix

482
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,750
length and if if you've got the if you

483
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,160
can you can set it to be an exact match

484
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,350
you might want to consider doing that

485
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,240
because that's it may save you once we

486
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:07,639
have more more networks dropping in

487
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,130
ballads in the amount of a route

488
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,100
optimizer legal yeah oh yeah we're

489
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,830
hoping this type of analysis we've

490
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,689
published this now it's a live site with

491
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,699
lots of things you can download out of

492
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,830
it use anything missing or you have any

493
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,280
questions you feel free to reach out to

494
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:28,070
me and yeah if you see anybody saying

495
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,720
China Telecom hijack 50% of the internet

496
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:37,220
please send them my way and I'll sell

497
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:44,880
them straight alright thanks a lot

498
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:44,880
[Applause]

499
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:52,210
mm-hmm Doug Montgomery your percentage

500
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,190
of peers are strictly the percentage of

501
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,309
peers that your collectors talk to

502
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:02,570
that's right man it's not the AS IS in

503
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:10,190
the paths downstream of the leaf no

504
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:13,220
which are also affected yeah good yeah

505
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:17,900
we're just we're using just I'm trying

506
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:20,809
to think what would be so it yeah it is

507
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,550
a function of who you you appear with

508
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:25,580
we're collecting right I mean is it is

509
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:27,980
yeah and what about a metric that looks

510
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,830
at the number of routes that pass

511
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,020
through those points the never arouse

512
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,678
the pass through the points which points

513
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:41,540
the point that that had been affected by

514
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,960
the hijack right the resources or what's

515
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,629
the point

516
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:50,330
well it kind of gets to the point of the

517
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:52,580
impact on you know where that where the

518
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,710
a s is who have accepted the leak are

519
00:21:52,580 --> 00:22:00,710
right and how many routes to those

520
00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:01,910
destinations pass through them I don't

521
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,900
think I'm following the question I'm

522
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:07,510
sorry how many how many routes

523
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,810
that normally pass through them to get

524
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,100
to well let's say that I'm affected by

525
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,080
the league right I've look at the league

526
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,209
but there are very few routes that pass

527
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,379
towards that destination through me

528
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,650
right I mean it's sort of a different

529
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,880
dimension of impact I guess I guess

530
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,970
maybe that'd be a reason why I wouldn't

531
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,520
use an intermediate AAS so in these and

532
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,380
those and that BGP those the the BJP

533
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,320
sources we're using for that pure

534
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:35,230
percentage those are all full tables so

535
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,330
they all can be guaranteed you know with

536
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:41,320
some caveats there they're gonna carry

537
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:43,330
those routes and so then if if you were

538
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,120
to start getting into intermediate hops

539
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:48,540
in a SS then right maybe maybe they

540
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:53,919
weren't normally on on the path so

541
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:58,000
obvious argument for using the b2b

542
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:04,990
sources that have full tables but all

543
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,420
right yes hi did you look at sort of

544
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:12,670
Delta integral numerically or visually

545
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:15,100
on a what if everyone was doing origin

546
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:17,530
validation or in the glorious future

547
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,969
world where there is I think there is an

548
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,980
RFC on path validation but we're

549
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:24,580
actually doing it how that would change

550
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,050
so separating the more specifics and

551
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,669
whether you're you know you mark you're

552
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,129
covering but just for the same

553
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,220
specificity I think we need to draw two

554
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:36,520
pictures one is what happened and what

555
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:39,070
what could be with that would be but I

556
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:42,940
haven't done that but do we value in

557
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,950
that yeah okay and we're happy to take a

558
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,300
look at adding traffic density to some

559
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,520
of this stuff too so we could look at

560
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,750
not not just number of routes but

561
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,280
actually you know sort of traffic

562
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,530
affected oh that would be great because

563
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,110
there's one obviously a huge assumption

564
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,149
here is any kind of large-scale BGP

565
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:00,250
analysis like this is you're assuming

566
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,020
all prefixes are the same we're assuming

567
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,940
all ifs are the same obviously those are

568
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,389
not true but BGP inherently doesn't know

569
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:10,840
and until difference having some sort of

570
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:13,030
notion of traffic would be a stronger

571
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,490
mechanism for teasing out impact because

572
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:17,590
we all learned during AF 7007 which is

573
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:21,039
for sale right now by the way

574
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:23,649
to put your name servers and things like

575
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:29,830
that in the first slash 24 of any

576
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:32,219
natural say sure thing Thanks yes David

577
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:35,350
Paul mmm David Paul Zimmerman LinkedIn

578
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,389
my photographic or lack thereof memory

579
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,309
I'm trying to keep all the different 3d

580
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:40,629
graphs that you had up there okay my

581
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:42,970
head in there all I'm happy to go back

582
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:45,158
to one maybe if maybe a couple what I

583
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,649
think I noticed was that a lot of them

584
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:50,649
that they had that waterfall effect over

585
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:52,389
time but the time element seemed to be

586
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:55,178
kind of binary the event was happening

587
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:57,330
or it was not happening how about this

588
00:24:55,179 --> 00:25:01,539
one yeah that's a great example so I'm

589
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:04,210
looking at the time axis and it all kind

590
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:06,669
of falls off at that one time and you

591
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,440
don't get much after that yeah and I

592
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:10,090
kind of remember most of the graphs kind

593
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,070
of being like that where you've got two

594
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:16,299
axes which are amazing information and

595
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:18,309
one which is kind of mmm it's helpful I

596
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:19,658
was one so where I'm going to is I was

597
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:21,570
wondering if you had any thoughts about

598
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:25,299
other data that you could represent

599
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:27,610
along that axis that which is the axis

600
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:29,679
you find the the time one where you've

601
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:32,008
got kind of that hard time okay then

602
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,470
you've got that hard line you got this

603
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:37,629
you show the the fall-off of the actual

604
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,100
impact of the prefixes and you've got

605
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:42,639
the kind of this hard line about halfway

606
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,678
down where at time X it's over it's over

607
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:47,350
and so it ends up a kind of binary where

608
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:52,119
if you replace that with another kind of

609
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:54,189
datum okay I I don't think these

610
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:58,168
examples in this talk there's good

611
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:00,730
examples of where time is helpful but

612
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:03,070
they exist of times where there's

613
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,330
there's kind of different phases through

614
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:07,629
time or there's some sort of like

615
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:09,970
oscillation going on and I think having

616
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:11,168
a time dimension is helpful to to

617
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,960
understand

618
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,460
state as it goes through time I only

619
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,619
watched shows like it's improving and

620
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,350
then it like doubles down and gets worse

621
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:21,908
again yeah so I would want to be able to

622
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:24,490
capture that I feel like one of the

623
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:26,950
weaknesses again for our stuff in the

624
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,000
past as well as this is an evolving

625
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,130
three-dimensional thing as it goes

626
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,320
through time

627
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,250
maybe this one has got kind of like a I

628
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,939
mean there's a little bit of

629
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:37,260
dimensionality but there's there's a

630
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,550
sense consistent but yeah there's

631
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,550
there's other examples of times where

632
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,110
there's something just one one state and

633
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:47,280
then it's another state maybe it's going

634
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:50,669
on and off and then time would be

635
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,540
helpful to know you know but well is

636
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,920
there usually you're in it you're going

637
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,629
to suggest another axis though what was

638
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,490
no I wasn't I was all kind of suggesting

639
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,950
if there was another way of showing time

640
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,600
and replacing that axis with something I

641
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,590
would said I was getting - have you

642
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,990
thought about other data you might

643
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,860
replace that axis with that something

644
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:10,110
there's a somebody's volunteering for

645
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:12,120
offer up some flow data probably I don't

646
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,129
know maybe that would be that would be

647
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:23,449
great yeah all right thanks

648
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:23,450
thank you all right thanks a lot

649
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,379
you

650
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,379
[Applause]
