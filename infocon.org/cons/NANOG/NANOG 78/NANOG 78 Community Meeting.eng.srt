1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,899
for those who don't know me I'm Edie

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,569
Rubik Nair and I'm the executive

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,219
director of nanog and I'm going to be

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,990
addressing and talking about some of the

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,759
things we're doing in the organization

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,330
that's just kind of outside of the realm

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,500
of the program Steve and cat will be

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,240
coming behind me they're gonna be

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,689
talking about some of the areas specific

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,759
to the program itself now one thing that

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,930
we do hopefully want from this is to

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,699
make it a little more kind of

13
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,900
interactive we're trying to communicate

14
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,630
to you what we're doing as an

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,879
organization what our strategy where

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,190
we're going in the future and so this is

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,260
kind of a part of that so this is part

18
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,570
of our commitment to transparency

19
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:43,589
openness and helping to promote and

20
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,629
expand the community so when I first

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,629
start out talking about our outreach

22
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,190
events outreach has been kind of a big

23
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,890
part of what I've wanted to do as an

24
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,260
executive director I kind of in some way

25
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,210
see myself is partially an evangelist

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,710
for the organization and I'm trying to

27
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,559
make it grow and get more people engaged

28
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,180
within our community for the benefit

29
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,789
nuts for us but all for the industry as

30
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,229
a whole so I've had the pleasure of

31
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,970
doing a couple of these are events that

32
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,510
have happened since I last saw you at

33
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,830
the last meeting so first up is I had

34
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,479
the pleasure of attending the indigenous

35
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:21,450
community summit in Hilo Hawaii it was

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,340
put on by I sock and it was a great

37
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,420
opportunity to be a part of that and to

38
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,119
see what's going on

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,140
now before we wondered okay I was in

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,659
Hilo Hawaii

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,009
I never even set foot on the beach I

42
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,720
flew in one day

43
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,520
there for the conference for two days

44
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,090
flew right out but I had an incredible

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,658
experience it was held at a university

46
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,729
there in Hilo and it is the largest are

47
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,509
clearly saying the only indigenous

48
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,880
language school in the continental

49
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,520
United States or not sorry in the United

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,350
States and there they focused on about

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,110
building community in the relationships

52
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,658
and advocating for people in indigenous

53
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,270
communities the connectivity that we

54
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,280
take advantage of in our daily lives is

55
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,719
sorely missing and it was a wonderful

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,429
opportunity to hear people from all over

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,049
North America talking about the

58
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,430
challenges the successes the

59
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,980
tribulations they went through in

60
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,260
getting the

61
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,640
access within their communities it also

62
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,590
gave me an opportunity to share about

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,018
nanog the mission of Education and

64
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,629
community to promote Nana's vast library

65
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:25,610
of online content to encourage

66
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:27,739
enrollment in our mailing list where so

67
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,200
much information can be had in addition

68
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:35,269
to discuss the educational community

69
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:38,119
value of our Nana conferences Nanog

70
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:40,280
university this is something that's near

71
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,560
and dear to my heart and that is getting

72
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,200
university engagement into what we do as

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,540
an organization if you look throughout

74
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,819
our industry you'll find that there's a

75
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,358
huge deficit organizations are trying to

76
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:55,310
find more people to employ and we're in

77
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:58,519
stiff competition with other areas and

78
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,560
technology so part of what I myself do

79
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,420
and volunteers in the organization where

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,430
they're trying to evangelize our

81
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,619
industry the opportunities and talk

82
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,750
about what we do so I had the wonderful

83
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,840
privilege of joining several of our

84
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:15,799
community cat not this cat cat new

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,349
Microsoft and also Eddie and others

86
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,380
crossing and delivering our first namma

87
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:23,690
university tour we went to three schools

88
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,180
three days and we saw about a hundred

89
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,579
and eighty plus students University of

90
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,660
Illinois urbana-champaign Purdue Ball

91
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:34,099
State here's an example of the agenda

92
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,739
that we had done during the conference

93
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:39,108
it was a raving success the students

94
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,049
loved it they were engaged as I was

95
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:43,340
sharing with the PC earlier this morning

96
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,510
for most of you in this room you guys

97
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,130
have been in the industry for a while

98
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,899
and you're a little bit jaded you're

99
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,060
looking for and a talk what are the

100
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,579
little pearls I can find that really

101
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,380
kind of matter to me for these students

102
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:56,120
they're they're new to the subjects a

103
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,819
lot of them weren't even in field to

104
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,530
technology but to see how engaged they

105
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,569
were into the process how hungry they

106
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,010
were to know more and how we saw people

107
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,690
shifting and saying well I could see

108
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,819
myself within a career in this industry

109
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,680
so it was a wonderful privilege to be

110
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:11,510
able to get in front of young minds and

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,010
to encourage them and to see what are

112
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:17,570
the opportunities they have within our

113
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:19,099
industry Montgomery outreach so there's

114
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,418

00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:23,570

125
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:46,240

126

137
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,258

142
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,319
nanak does who nanak is and how we can

143
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,500
benefit their communities

144
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,440
now there's one particular incident that

145
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,529
I have how's it the valiant Academy and

146
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,620
the value of Academy is a it's a

147
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:41,169
non-profit private Academy that is

148
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,009
tuition free to students they reach out

149
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:46,539
to students who come from you know

150
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,759
difficult situations and try to turn

151
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:50,080
their lives around and sometimes when

152
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,849
you're presenting to a group of people

153
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,878
you have these moments where someone

154
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:57,878
comes out and does something special for

155
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,490
you that young man with a circle in red

156
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:02,590
he asked me a question and I used to

157
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,090
teach for quite a while and occasionally

158
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,250
a student will present something to that

159
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:09,340
kind of turns your head upside down and

160
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,569
I was talking about my career my

161
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,119
background what I had done to get where

162
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:16,120
he is and he asked me this question he

163
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,440
said so how do you do it when you said

164
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,800
you something that's really really hard

165
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,680
what do you do to get past it and I pass

166
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,110
through and I said sometimes failure is

167
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,120
not an option

168
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,050
sometimes it's hours times commitment

169
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,000
sometimes you don't sleep and I think we

170
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,009
all have faced that in our lives to get

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,289
where we are now that we face these

172
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,860
challenges and we just didn't relinquish

173
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,199
we didn't give

174
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,969
and it was a great opportunity to be

175
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,759
able to share about my life and my

176
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:47,080
experience and hopefully that you come

177
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,909

178
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,378

241
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,310
in the next several weeks it'll be out

242
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:25,310
on our website we'll promote on our

243
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,869
mailing list social media etc this is

244
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,790
just an opportunity to share with what

245
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,140

costs associated with these events are

251
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,660

255
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,949
things should we keep what things should

256
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,170

organization there's some really great

281
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:50,560
content that goes in there

282
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:58,360
so in december late december the board

283
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,540
and i went through a series of exercises

284
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,170
and planning to kind of shape two-way

285
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,969
nanako's going into the future so we're

286
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,060
looking at kind of a strategic

287
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,760
advancement for the organization so in

288
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,510
that session we covered the questions of

289
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,210
what is nanog what should they not be

290
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:21,010
what are Nanak's most urgent needs where

291
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,670
would worship now not be in three years

292
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:26,620
and also a swap analysis now by putting

293
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,689
this all together the board came out

294
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,760
what would we call strategic guidance

295
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,710
now again this is not a strategic plan

296
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,300
it's a strategic guidance we're going to

297
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,010
be using this guidance to actually

298
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,410
create and build out a strategic plan

299
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,790
that will push our organization forward

300
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,520
for the next three years

301
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,349
so here the areas where the board saw

302
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,250
significant important that we as an

303
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,620
organization should focus on education

304
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,810
enhancing community online collaboration

305
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,820
strategic outreach mentorship improved

306
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,390
community building and facilitating

307
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:00,880
business engagement so as I dig into

308
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,650
each one of those things education so

309
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,720
the direct guidance that I received from

310
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:08,020
the board is to form an education

311
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,390
committee to investigate I gotta fix

312
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,720
that investigate the following areas for

313
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:16,420
board consideration making structured

314
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,300
online you know I'm human structured

315
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,400
online education training and education

316
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,040
outside of our conferences that would

317
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,050
for example nanog university neutral a

318
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,790
vendor neutral certification non

319
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,680
technical professional development

320
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,349
programs content development in

321
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,849
collaboration with the program now this

322
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,800
does not mean that we are going to

323
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,230
actually be able to accomplish all these

324
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,150
goals these are kind of some high level

325
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,770
ideas for these committees to address

326
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,939
there are proposals are going to be

327
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,310
built and put together by these

328
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,880
committees that will be subordinate or

329
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:51,400
consideration enhancing community online

330
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,200
collaboration here the guidances staff

331
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,209
will research and present proposals for

332
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,510
the board for consideration a knowledge

business engagement business engagement

381
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,670
has always been a part of these meetings

382
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,230
and it's actually grown in scope the

383
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,300
board recognizes that and we're looking

384
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,550
at ways to make it easier to do business

385
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,140
some people come here specifically to be

386
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,689
in this room and listen to the content

387
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,670
others are here to take make connections

388
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,140
and develop business contacts and

389
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,329
facilitate business arrangements and

390
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,819
we're committed to making that easier

391
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,800
for our attendees so we're looking at

392
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,899
trying to get more private meeting space

393
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,599
online room reservation systems easy

394
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,910

395
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,769
input on updating responsive offerings

396
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,050
research what would generate greater

397
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:31,930
participation from current and potential

398
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,579
sponsors so these are just a few of the

399
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,459
things that we're looking at again this

400
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,410
is all about guidance we're between

401
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:40,060
staff and committees we'll be building

402
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,670

403
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,859

410
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:02,740
our community even stronger and better

411
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,050

412
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,339

as Steve expressed or in the meeting we

431
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,839
lost a significant member of our

432
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,550
community and as part of the people who

433
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,589
have started down a get made of what it

434
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,629
is we're at that point where we're

435
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,800
tipping this is going to become more and

436
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,020
more frequent thing that's going to

437
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,490
happen within our organization and we

438
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,889
always want to pay homage to those

439
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:13,480
who've gotten us to where we are so on

440
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,309
our website we're going to be creating a

441
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,010
page is going to be devoted to those

442
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:20,230
people within our community who have

443
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,189
passed and who are no longer with us so

444
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,419
if you have anyone who's already passed

445
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,939
anyone who you know passed in the future

446
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:30,169
please go on to our website submitted to

447
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,700
myself or to the board

448
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:38,239
and we will make sure that they are

449
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:47,779
properly honored on our website now

450
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:50,299
we're on to the program thank you so I'm

451
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:53,139
Steve Feldman representing Katmai

452
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:55,668
representing the program committee I'll

453
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,899
briefly go over our structure I know we

454
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:58,009
talked about it in a lot more detail at

455
00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:01,399
the last meeting so there's no point

456
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:04,669
repeating too much we have a chair

457
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:07,369
Vince salindra who is working on

458
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,600
something he leads all of the program

459
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:11,359
committee meetings and basically drives

460
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,549
the entire process I'm the vice chair so

461
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:17,418
my job is to stand up here when Vince is

462
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:20,269
busy and and help them out and Kat is

463
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:22,039
our secretary who is responsible for a

464
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:23,480
lot of things but primarily making sure

465
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:25,850
that there are things up on the screen

466
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,639
to display that come from the

467
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,529
presentations that you also bit so I'm

468
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:33,889
going to talk a little bit about some of

469
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:35,330
the enhancement hi Tigger some of the

470
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:37,639
enhancements that we've been making to

471
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:41,509
streamline the process and make things

472
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:45,320
better for you guys the speakers and the

473
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:47,570
attendees the question that I have been

474
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,730
asked for ever since I started working

475
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:53,029
on nanog is why can't the agenda come

476
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,409
out sooner so we're working on exactly

477
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,019
that right now we have a couple of

478
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:58,850
initiatives the biggest one being what

479
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:00,980
we're calling a continual call for

480
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,418
presentations where you don't longer

481
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,830
have to wait until this meeting is over

482
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:06,230
before you can submit a talk for the

483
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,619
next one in fact at this point if you go

484
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,389
into the program committee tool you can

485
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:14,330
go in submission tool you can submit as

486
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:17,178
far out as Nanog 80 right now and we'll

487
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,820
keep rolling that out so you can do at

488
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,169
least two meetings in advance from now

489
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,330
on so that means that we can start the

490
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:25,609
whole review cycle earlier means we can

491
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,009
accept talks earlier and get the at

492
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:29,449
least partial agendas out earlier and

493
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:31,279
hopefully make the whole process

494
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,419
smoother and improve the quality of our

495
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,619
content as a nice byproduct of that

496
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:37,999
there are some enhancements to the tool

497
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:41,340
that make this a lot easier like the

498
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:43,830
ability to as I said submit for

499
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,178
future Nanak's and also we have the

500
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,279
ability to take a talk that was

501
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,590
submitted for this dialogue and if for

502
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,879
example we had a lot of these they came

503
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,580
in past the deadline we could just

504
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:56,340
switch them to be in early submit early

505
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,100
consideration for the next standout and

506
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,418
to get a head start that way so I'm

507
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,189
making the process smoother for

508
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:04,470
everybody

509
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,629
we hope the other thing that we're doing

510
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,249
new this time and it's almost too late

511
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:12,090
for that but we have a program committee

512
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:13,499
help desk out in the lobby area I think

513
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,749
it's only staffed until 10 o'clock this

514
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:17,309
morning but feel free to go out there

515
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:18,899
there should be somebody out there to

516
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:21,690
answer any questions you might have

517
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:22,949
about the submission process if you're

518
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,350
interested in submitting something and

519
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,519
want some advice if you're interested in

520
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,320
serving on the program committee

521
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,320
although it's too late for this year

522
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:36,240
cycle maybe so I think he really about

523
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,678
some be candidate next year so that's it

524
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,889
a cat I think we'll talk a bit more

525
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,389
about the submission process and what

526
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:46,320
we're doing to improve that and where do

527
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:48,600
you tell and here's the clicker and I

528
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,249
think the next slide has the wheel on it

529
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,570
there we go so as Steve mentioned we're

530
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:56,279
working in this continual call for

531
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,019
presentations where you no longer have

532
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,330
to wait until a few weeks after to begin

533
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:01,619
so you know even if you won't be here in

534
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,269
June but you know you can come to

535
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:04,740
October and you've got a great idea you

536
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:07,049
can put that in now and start working

537
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,480
with someone so once we begin receiving

538
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:10,740
proposals the first thing that we do is

539
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,269
we assign a Shepherd from the program

540
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,700
committee who will guide you through the

541
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:16,289
whole process so that if someone who's

542
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,700
going to be one-on-one with you they're

543
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:20,220
gonna review your slides give you

544
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,389
initial feedback before you ever get put

545
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,639
in through voting to the rest of the

546
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:25,168
committee and yes even if you're Smitty

547
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:26,789
fortuna Anton's that will still start

548
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:28,619
working with you now to hone those

549
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:30,269
presentations and make them ready to go

550
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,418
and have a chance at succeeding in

551
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:35,070
voting and getting into the agenda so

552
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,899
once you've got your presentation in

553
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,668
we've given you a Shepherd the sooner

554
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:41,869
you get us slides the easier it is for

555
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:44,220
us to help you and get you prepared and

556
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:45,809
also the earlier we can vote once you

557
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,320
are finalized with those slides for your

558
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:49,350
shepherds

559
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,840
so the earlier we vote the earlier the

560
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,070
chances of you getting on that agenda so

561
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,509
it's always good first to have your

562
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,950
slides early basically and that's why we

563
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:58,100
want

564
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:00,410
the call for presentations continually

565
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,780
instead of having to wait because we can

566
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,430
really help you guys prepare that's also

567
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,070
why we do the program committee helped

568
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,170
us now because we want to be there for

569
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:14,120
all the questions you guys have and be

570
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:15,770
more forefront in that vision that's it

571
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,159
as Secretary I must remind you that

572
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,840
slides do have deadlines if your slides

573
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,580
come in too late unfortunately then I

574
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,959
can't help you anymore because we can't

575
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,970
vote on something if the slides aren't

576
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,910
finalized they're not there so it really

577
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,620
does matter that you get those slides in

578
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,880
before the deadlines we need to see that

579
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,840
early we need to help you through them

580
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,850
and then we need to vote in time once

581
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,679
we've got all the slides finalized

582
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,689
everything's in voted on that's when we

583
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,460
try to get the agenda published so the

584
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,620
sooner we get everybody's agenda yeah

585
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,870
sorry the sooner we get everybody's

586
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,010
slides and submissions in the sooner we

587
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,270
can publish an agenda for the rest of

588
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,400
the community so you can start going to

589
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,170
your bosses and saying hey there's these

590
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,310
great talks coming up can I please go to

591
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:59,690
the next nanog and then the circle is a

592
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,070
little outdated now because conference

593
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,900
begins and we don't know we no longer

594
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,020
have that call for proposals restarting

595
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:08,180
it's just always open now

596
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,620
but yeah so I hope that explains the

597
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,660
general process to you just get slides

598
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:16,790
in early we'll work with you we'll help

599
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:18,800
you get through the process oh yes so we

600
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:21,379
do value your feedback and this PC tool

601
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,480
has been really great in helping us do

602
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,940
just that by having multiple nanog

603
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,070
submitted but we do recognize that PC

604
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,730
tool is new it is not the same one we've

605
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:33,830
used for many years so feedback is very

606
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,880
welcomed for us and for the developers

607
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,310

608
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,480
they're a great team so please let us

609
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,860
know if you go to upload something it

610
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,450
doesn't quite work as you expected

611
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,669
you're not sure where to find something

612
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,080
on the tool please send that feedback in

613
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,660
because we want it to work for you guys

614
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,740
as well as for us and the more feedback

615
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:55,130
we get on that the better we can make

616
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:57,530
the tool for everybody yeah one other

617
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,150
one other thing I want to mention did

618
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,350

are part of the PC leadership which

624
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,649
means that we help herd the process but

625
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,840
the real work is done by the committee

626
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,940
members they spend a lot of time

627
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,919
reviewing shepherding and making sure

628
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,870

631
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,430
last thing we'd like to take a moment if

632
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,470
anyone have any question about either

633
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,840
your organization or the program that

634
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,190
would be happy to answer so the mics are

635
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,689
open and if any of you have any

636
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:45,530
questions or anything you'd like to ask

637
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:47,420

639
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,410
broader membership any questions that

640
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,050
you think you'd like to get like a straw

641
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,370
survey of hands up what are the

642
00:24:54,050 --> 00:25:02,419
questions that you'd like to ask this

643
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:03,800
group I'm gonna do that next time I've

644
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,870
got a bunch of them rattling through my

645
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,399
head but yes I will use that as a forum

646
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,989
to get a show of hands because that's a

647
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,720
good thing - thank you for that yeah I

648
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,280
actually have one that I'd like to see I

649
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,500
can't spend the time here just really

650
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,550
have left for four minutes left but one

651
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,880
of the things I like to see reflected in

652
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,980
the survey is how do you feel the level

653
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,260
of the material or the mix of levels of

654
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,350
material beginner intermediate advanced

655
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,270
is there enough to keep everybody

656
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,520
engaged and keep bringing in new people

657
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:34,400
while still keeping as Greybeards

658
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,680
interested so the study of the right mix

659
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,080
of presentations to accept is ketose

660
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,450
mm-hm

661

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,730
hey I was on the PC and it you know

663
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,190
earlier years and I think you touched on

664
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,710
it but I I know well hopefully this is

665
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,230
still correct but to reiterate to people

666
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,730
like the slides like the program

667
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,920
committee can't really evaluate

668
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,810
something without slides correct like

669
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,430
people I know people would come to us

670
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,690
and they'd say oh I put in an abstract

671
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,220
and I'm waiting to hear if you're going

672
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,610
to accept it and then I'll do the slides

673
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,630
and that can't work you know what I mean

674
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,490
according to the process that I

675
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,880
remembered because you need to know like

676
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:15,350
the level and the detail and that's you

677
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,940
know it doesn't they don't have to be

678
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,310
totally finalized but they have to be

679
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,330
something with some serious meat so that

680
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,399
the program committee

681
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,370
can assess them otherwise they just

682
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,890
can't so if you're in that way of

683
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,989
thinking you have to actually get to the

684
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,500
slice yeah and I would say this almost a

685
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,780
flip

686
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,780
give us the slides in the abstracted

687
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:37,220
come like yeah because they have

688
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,360
struggled to millions it being more for

689
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,490
what we're gonna publish on the agenda

690
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,260
page but like you said the slides are

691
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,490
paramount we need to look at those and

692
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:48,890
really understand what you're trying to

693
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:53,060
present so the kelpie through those okay

694

so something happens let me know Thanks

713
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,850
I would like to mention something else

714
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,949
about the discussion around slides

715
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,290
slides are not required to submit your

716
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,790
ideas for lightning talks it is really

717
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:58,010
just meant to be a crazy idea you've had

718
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,510
so submit those you can get those slides

719
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,410
in by the morning of the day you're

720
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,180
going to present the lightning talk

721
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,320
appear accepted but don't think you have

722
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,640
to have a bunch of slides prepared just

723
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,560
because you want to do a lightning talk

724
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,200
you need to be prepared to create slides

725
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:13,250
for me but they're not required for that

726
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,110
submission process at least yeah alright

727
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,610
well thank you all for attending nan

728
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,600

729
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,600
time appreciate it
