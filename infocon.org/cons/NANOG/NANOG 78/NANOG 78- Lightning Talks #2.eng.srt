1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,770
good afternoon everyone so today we're

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,439
gonna be talking about something that's

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,230
not similar to what you've seen this

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,620
past week we're gonna work on more

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,870
educational and talk about in the era

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,799
talk about the industry and collegiate

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,750
gap but before we do that I wanted to

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,340
introduce ourselves so my name is John

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,960
fan I'm a third year undergraduate

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,500
student at Purdue University and

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,000
pursuing a couple of degrees and I'm

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,649
also researcher in natural language

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,910
processing my name is ryan tom i'm also

14
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:37,469
undergraduate at purdue university in my

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,309
third year I'm studying cybersecurity

16
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,920
and psychology my name is neither PV and

17
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,149
I am a third year undergraduate student

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,180
at Purdue University studying cyber

19
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,770
security in psychology so before we get

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,420
into the meat and potatoes of our talk I

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,739
just wanted to walk us through what

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,629
we're gonna be talking about the talking

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,578
points that we'll cover so we'll go into

24
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,250
a little bit of background over what

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,160
we're actually talking about we're talk

26
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,379
about the current approaches tool for

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,420
joint connections for industry and

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,150
education we'll talk about what more we

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,920
can do and we'll talk about how you guys

30
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,130
can leave your own impact on the future

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,990
generation of the workforce so when we

32
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,920
were researching this topic we found

33
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,070
some really surprising statistics 18

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,979
months after hiring new hires 46% of

35
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,559
those new hires leave they either fail

36
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,770
out or they get they don't get the

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,540
enough training to last this lost

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,789
productivity from inadequate training

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,130
cost employees an average of one to two

40
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,530
point five of total revenue and that may

41
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,149
seem a little bit low but when you're

42
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,810
working in a two billion dollar industry

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,189
that's billions of dollars loss so

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,500
here's what we're currently doing at

45
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,508
Purdue University to help the future

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,820
workforce connect with industries and

47
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,229
employers we have on campus company

48
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,199
recruitment we have company information

49
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,689
sessions we have industry donations in

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,090
the form of either monetary or equipment

51
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,969
we have co-op and internship programs

52
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,979
that are facilitated from career fairs

53
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:09,449
that's a lot and we're privileged to

54
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,560
have that at a big University like

55
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,599
ourselves but it's not enough to help

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,190
all universities and it's not enough to

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,769
help everyone so what we propose is an

58
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,720
investment in the future we want more

59
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,670
employer engagement at an individual

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,920
level not just mass recruiting but

61
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,988
finding out what Brian here wants to do

62
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,359
with his life well how you can help him

63
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,400
fulfill his goals so that he can help

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,920
you fulfill your organizational needs

65
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,269
join industrial advisory boards these

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,679
are often times councils that help

67
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:45,950
colleges create a curriculum that you

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,260
guys want for your in for your

69
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:52,170
corporation so if you want students to

70
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,700
know bgp coming out of college you can

71
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,980
join these industrial advisory boards

72
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,010
and propose curriculum changes to add

73
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,849
that sponsor events and training

74
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:05,459
programs the number one thing that helps

75
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,679
us learn is hands-on training these

76
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,940
things help us learn what you guys want

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,920
us to do be like Nanog and sponsor

78
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,900
conferences do interpersonal networking

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,929
with people that are actually in the

80
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,209
field before I came to college I knew

81
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,519
nothing and no one within the field and

82
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,799
I found a mentor that mentor helped

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,450
guide me through what college is like

84
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,450
and what information security and

85
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,160
networking really is and on the note of

86
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,899
mentorship opportunities

87
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,900
Ryan black to share his experiences

88
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,829
alright so I'm gonna go a little bit

89
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,269
more in depth with some of these career

90
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,100
building opportunities specifically

91
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:47,069
mentorships what a lot of these things

92
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,079
have in common is these three things to

93
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,200
the left that you see so hands on

94
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:53,130
experience a lot of these give

95
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,319
opportunities to students have hands-on

96
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,299
experience in the field whether that is

97
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,220
configuring switches implementing

98
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,810
networking routes doing something

99
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,639
hands-on and technical that gives them

100
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,079
the experience but is different than the

101
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,530
classic theory that they learned in the

102
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,750
classroom

103
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,340
furthermore it gives them networking not

104
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,650
only the technical networking skills

105
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,510
that a lot of you seek but also that

106
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,329
social networking being able to connect

107
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,250
with people employers and other

108
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,470
companies in developing those in that

109
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,910
emotional intelligent and also the soft

110
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,820
skills needed to be able to communicate

111
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,200
and be successful in the working field

112
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,270
these together give them the ability to

113
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,919
strive it gives them

114
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,240
passion it gives them the curiosity to

115
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,400
really be able to go out in the work

116
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,020
field and accomplish great things and

117
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,419
you can see that in all of these

118
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,878
different opportunities such as a

119
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:39,229
college immersion program here letting

120
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,240
us be here and doing what we're doing

121
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,770
right now as well as participating in

122
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,720
the hackathon and being able to

123
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,599
participate in other talks here the

124
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,379
whole mentor and mentee

125
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:50,659
relationship which I'll go into more

126
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,970
depth on the next slide then also having

127
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:55,699
passionate instructors having

128
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,830
instructors that care about teaching the

129
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,500
student teaching the mid T and telling

130
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,639
them this is really what I care about in

131
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,490
the industry and this is how we do

132
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,229
things but without having that boring

133
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,210
just I'm going to lecture at you and

134
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,490
give you all this information deal with

135
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,340
it what you want so having a passionate

136
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,220
instructor can be a huge difference for

137
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,799
a student so here's a bit of a mentor

138
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,020
process just very simplified to be kind

139
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,340
of the power appeard learning so we've

140
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,799
already talked about hands-on teaching

141
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,258
being able to actually get in there and

142
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,949
do configurations work with fiber-optics

143
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:32,449
work with bgp all of these big industry

144
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:35,389
terms that we learn in the classroom but

145
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:37,490
we never might touch on a switch or a

146
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:40,490
command-line interface or actually see

147
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,319
what that config file looks like this

148
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,389
allows us to build knowledge building

149
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,590
that repertoire of information that way

150
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:47,270
we can go out in the field and be

151
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,948
prepared when we actually are going to

152
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,590
start working or doing some of these

153
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,630
internships and finally accomplishing

154
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,729
some objectives within the job if you

155
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,259
have a mentorship program the mentor

156
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:58,909
should be going through their day in

157
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:00,770
their daily operations whatever they

158
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,810
need to do and that person should be

159
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,080
shadowing the mentee should be shadowing

160
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,819
them knowing or asking questions and

161
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,889
being able to keep up with them and also

162
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:11,900
learn this is what a day to day job

163
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:13,909
looks like and what you get out of that

164
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,229
is the mentor still completes their job

165
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:16,069
for the day they still complete all

166
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,180
their objectives

167
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:19,190
well they've gained a greater

168
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,650
perspective by talking to the student

169
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,529
and seeing where education is currently

170
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,549
at and what needs to still be learned

171
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:27,500
furthermore you now have a skilled

172
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,400
worker that mentee has gone through the

173
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,560
entire job

174
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,388
they've been immersed in company culture

175
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,639
they've learned the job roles and the

176
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,320
technical skills needed to do it they

177
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,690
also have some working experience and

178
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,800
that ability to eventually become an

179
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,930
employee either

180
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,370
with you or somewhere else and have that

181
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,270
ability to mentor in the future and

182
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,560
complete that cycle so what happens when

183
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,299
you start thinking about a lot of these

184
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,970
things when you think about all the

185
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,590
other benefits possibly the mentee goes

186
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,210
back to school and has a lot of friends

187
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,568
that are also in that industry that same

188
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,388
field and now those are a lot of new

189
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:04,250
internship opportunists and people that

190
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,229
can go into your company and build your

191
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,960
company even more you also have that

192
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:11,000
mentorship cycle being able to keep

193
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,008
having this cycle repeat and now you're

194
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,110
going to have a lot of leaders that have

195
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,120
done the mentorship program have taught

196
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,860
and also have been taught it's a greater

197
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,680
connection between the company and

198
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,990
everyone all the employees there finally

199
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,940
just giving younger generations like

200
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,020
some direct experience and what happens

201
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,000
when you Institute this throughout

202
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,909
college education these are really big

203
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,229
questions but it not really sure how

204
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:37,879
we're going to do it and Tyler is going

205
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:39,620
to go into that more yeah so essentially

206
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,300
before I can answer Ryan's question I

207
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,129
really have to focus on the industry in

208
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,770
bantman trite so what's good about this

209
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,060
is that network is advancing at a rapid

210
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,349
pace

211
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,659
but what's bad about this is it's

212
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:52,789
difficult for network education

213
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:55,150
networking education to keep up

214
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:57,710
it typically seems infeasible that

215
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,090
education in this sector can match it's

216
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,318
advancements due to the financial

217
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,810
barriers do you have the right of lab

218
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,889
equipment do you have the amount of

219
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:10,969
money to teach faculty do you have

220
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:12,949
things of that nature so so it kind of

221
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:15,889
creates a revolving cycle right so once

222
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:18,529
I graduate from a my network engineering

223
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:20,419
undergraduate degree I'm at the point on

224
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:24,020
the left at the end of that arrow and

225
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:26,599
then I entered the job as a entry level

226
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,359
network engineer but I have to I have to

227
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,009
take this very winding road that

228
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,800
remembers that this line represents

229
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:35,839
which is approximately an 18th to a 60

230
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,750
month journey to be where I need to be

231
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,979
to be entry-level so with that being

232
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:46,430
said we need to do something better in

233
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:49,190
the undergraduate degree and that comes

234
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,380
with like corporate sponsors and things

235
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,380
that I'll get into on the next slide so

236
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,240
how can companies leave their mark

237
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,070
on undergraduate education particularly

238
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,500
in network engineering you need to

239
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,410
invest in the future of your company and

240
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,580
the field itself so if you have if you

241
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,550
hire somebody who came from another

242
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,670
company and they had good internal

243
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:12,640
education and they had good practices it

244
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,140
comes back and and it helps you write so

245
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,939
lending a helping hand to the younger

246
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,360
generation would include recommending

247
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,850
collegiate curriculum changes donating

248
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,630
networking equipment expanding

249
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,860
internship co-op mentorship programs and

250
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,960
increase continued education programs

251
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:33,690
for faculty employees and students

252
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,740
what good is donating equipment without

253
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,620
helping the faculty understand what it

254
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:42,850
does so making sure that is implemented

255
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,160
as a very important yeah so we would

256
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,910
really just like to thank nanog

257
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,620
especially their college immersion

258
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,430
program without them that we wouldn't be

259
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,770
here

260
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,120
but also the hardest-working professor

261
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,430
in computing professor nicole hands

262
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,110
she's right here can you stand up can we

263
00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:01,510
ever stand up everything from you know

264
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,280
staying up staying up late hours 4:00

265
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,860
a.m. you know trying to change lab

266
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,079
manuals to improve them or to you know

267
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:12,430
combat academic dishonesty she does it

268
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,630
so yeah thank you this is something that

269
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,910
we'd like to have a discussion with

270
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,320
people with so if you'd like to will be

271
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,130
available right after all the Lightning

272
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,130
talks thank you

273
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,560
okay Chris Moreau if you're here it's

274
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,560
your turn otherwise

275
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,849
Ruettiger please come up mm-hm that work

276
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,119
that's the people in the back we're

277
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,079
skipping so route Agurs talked it was

278
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,100
gonna be next

279
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,019
the so the one that were supposed to be

280
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,459
after this guy so skip to the one after

281
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:49,410
this yeah sorry about this

282
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:51,560
so while they're twisting the slides I

283
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,180
will introduce you rüdiger Volk is

284
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,339
versatile into telecom and he's going to

285
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:01,439
tell us about tools for bgp security

286
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:05,040
running security thank you yeah okay

287
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:10,920
considering that Google is the timing is

288
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:16,160
not right yet okay okay

289
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:19,130
I'm a bigger Fork I have been around

290
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,689
actual operational networking since

291
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:25,560
essentially what like a IP networking

292
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:28,319
since essentially 89 summer I reported

293
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,589
first time on the u.s. west coast about

294
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:39,229
IP action and Internet actually working

295
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:42,120
in Europe and later on the German telco

296
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:45,199
asked for help for getting something

297
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:49,110
done in the area and I have been

298
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:55,199
involved in IETF all the time in

299
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:58,410
parallel to be an operator so I'm going

300
00:11:55,199 --> 00:12:04,649
to talk about routing security yesterday

301
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:08,430
we had a panel on that and well okay

302
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:13,259
there are many many factors in relevant

303
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:16,819
for routing security and it is important

304
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:23,790
as I pointed out yesterday to be precise

305
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:29,040
when talking about security and the RQ

306
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:35,310
spec tool and specification technology

307
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:39,990
that we have done recently is just one

308
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:41,160
factor or addressing just one factor in

309
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:47,570
the routing secure

310
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:52,400
the area but yes it is trying to be

311
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:56,130
pretty rigid and the factor is the

312
00:12:52,400 --> 00:13:02,340
management of rigid ingress route

313
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:05,970
filters which has been considered kind

314
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,750
of a requirement for everybody all the

315
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,850
time

316
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:16,890
but actually the implementation has been

317
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:19,440
difficult and lacking in many cases so

318
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,720
this is about route

319
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,150
traffic's filtering and documentation

320
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,730
for that and the question is based on

321
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:30,630
what data can we do this in the precise

322
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:34,530
and Richard fetch fashion and that's

323
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:39,210
been a problem our Q spec provides a

324
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:41,970
very specification formalism and well

325
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:47,450
okay we will look at the details of that

326
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:50,580
to some extent we are providing

327
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:54,030
evaluation on the web portal and we will

328
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:58,710
see at the end a quick look at snapshots

329
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:07,520
of the diet whoops this is this way of

330
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:10,440
the provided web diagnostics so the

331
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,680
traditional problem space is everybody

332
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:18,210
is supposed to document the customer

333
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:21,979
cone by way of registering a assets in

334
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:25,860
the internet routing registry the RP SL

335
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:32,030
based databases that are around and that

336
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:36,120
are fairly badly managed and organized

337
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:40,610
and register root or root six objects

338
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,730
for the announced routes in this IRR

339
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,100
quest

340
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:48,060
problems and questions they are which

341
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:50,250
IRR is used by who and what is the

342
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,800
quality of the data that's still there

343
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,710
and is very any authorization for what's

344
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,550
put there

345
00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:01,570
and that means essentially there is lots

346
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:05,540
of garbage and confusion out there and

347
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:08,950
to do good filtering it is essential

348
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:13,939
that you be very selective about vir use

349
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:18,830
but so far we do not have a commonly

350
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:23,870
agreed way of telling people which

351
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:28,339
precise way of using vir our data is

352
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:31,640
supposed to happen and much less are

353
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:35,980
there diagnostic tools for figuring out

354
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:39,649
what are murky spots in the data and

355
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:45,200
that would be of course a starting point

356
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:50,330
for cleaning up stuff now for a long

357
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:55,190
time people have been working on rpki

358
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:58,940
as helping for more secure information

359
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:02,029
for routing security and we have the

360
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:08,360
rpki ross there which are looking like

361
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:10,790
via ir routes but as a clean thing with

362
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:15,320
authorization in the background and all

363
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:18,860
nice things and the interesting question

364
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:22,580
is well ok how can we make use of the

365
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:30,140
old and the new stuff in the most in the

366
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:33,950
best way are to spec actually is I think

367
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:38,620
a nice step forward in doing this we

368
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:42,800
have a precise and concise definition of

369
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:49,760
what how to query the databases in

370
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:54,349
combination the combination makes full

371
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:58,310
use of the old and the new and thus

372
00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:02,779
enables a smooth progress towards more

373
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:05,800
use of the new authorized system the

374
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:07,319
implementation is not just the

375
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,109
specification

376
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:13,280
formalism but we have the tools to

377
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:16,589
actually evaluate according to the

378
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,680
specification and that's implemented

379
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:24,709
first of all as a command-line tool as

380
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:28,140
is usually integrated in generating

381
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:31,740
configuration tools tool chains but we

382
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:35,340
also have make the stuff available as a

383
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:38,390
web-based service and this includes not

384
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:44,850
just generating filters but also

385
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:51,090
providing diagnostic information okay

386
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:54,000
and so let me try to speed up well okay

387
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:57,510
the formalism is essentially defined

388
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,690
using Excel XML schema which we will be

389
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:08,120
hiding behind web UI there is an XML

390
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:11,580
XSLT rule set that helps to actually

391
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,149
define and implement the semantics of

392
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:17,610
the schema and we have the

393
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:21,450
implementation at the moment at a pilot

394
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:25,229
stage for use internally within the

395
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:28,230
deutsche telekom group obviously what we

396
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:34,230
are showing is I think something that

397
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:40,230
would be useful as a public service this

398
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:45,300
is a sketch of well okay how the schema

399
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:50,340
and its various attributes are presented

400
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:52,860
on the web interviews er interface we

401
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:58,199
have to decide first of all whether we

402
00:18:52,860 --> 00:19:04,169
want an evaluation for an a s set or a

403
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:08,720
root set result depending on which type

404
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:14,160
of result we want we have a selection of

405
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:17,700
variants of evaluation modes that may be

406
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,909
good for creating filters of that that

407
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,869
may be good for giving you

408
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:28,859
specific diagnostic hints about stuff

409
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:35,879
that looks not good and then we have a

410
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:38,340
field where the IRR data sources can be

411
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:41,840
selected and it is a little bit more

412
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:47,699
sophisticated than what you are used to

413
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:55,470
in the old time standard IRR evaluation

414
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:59,059
tools okay I have to speed up and there

415
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:02,549
are different variants for VA s sets

416
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:05,999
there is the standard plain thing and

417
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:09,059
then there are things like well okay we

418
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:12,029
expose and give you the a SS that are in

419
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:15,210
VA s set that are actually not supposed

420
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:18,809
to show up anywhere because IANA has has

421
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:24,599
still reserved them and in practice this

422
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:28,109
this is seen all the time and a SS that

423
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:32,070
have been are allocated by INR to our

424
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:37,168
IRS but VR IRS have returned them into

425
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:41,989
the free pools is more frequent by at

426
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:47,970
least an order of magnitude so that's

427
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:51,629
obviously useful diagnostic information

428
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:56,580
for pointing people to two bad spots in

429
00:20:51,629 --> 00:21:00,269
their data for the route set the

430
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:05,269
variants are actually more interesting

431
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:08,759
we have used the the usual old plain IRR

432
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:13,070
resolution we also have a variant where

433
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:18,029
we say please give me just the rowers

434
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:21,779
for the a SS that are the argument in

435
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:26,840
the evaluation and then we can also do

436
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:30,440
variance views of the IRR data

437
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:33,830
classified according to the original

438
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,080
validation of our PK

439
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:41,189
where it is in particular in tour of

440
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:46,559
interest to flag the roots that we find

441
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:50,369
in vir are that are invalid and for

442
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:53,759
making a good combined use we have we

443
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:56,459
are clean thing which is the filter to

444
00:21:53,759 --> 00:22:01,259
be generated in the future where we

445
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:07,139
actually only use the rpki validated

446
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:09,809
clean IRR data and enrich that by adding

447
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:16,439
all the good raw information from the

448
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:19,259
art rpki so I was talking we have a

449
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:26,840
customer analysis website presentation

450
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:33,269
and that essentially provides two views

451
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:37,529
one of the a s set with all the variants

452
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:42,210
and oh I it would be really nice to have

453
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:47,399
a pointer here what we what what I can

454
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:50,519
point to there is the bed rears column

455
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:54,508
that you see and there we have an

456
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:59,879
example were an a s that is actually not

457
00:22:54,509 --> 00:23:04,879
valid to use according to our IR data is

458
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:08,549
flecked and in the bed rears column and

459
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:10,918
yeah while okay for the curious seeing

460
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:14,940
which a SS that are in the set actually

461
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:21,169
have robust may be of interest but while

462
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:26,759
okay that's not that crucial for the

463
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:31,369
sorry for the route sets diagnostic page

464
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:34,830
we have more variants and the example

465
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:39,209
shows and this is all real data I only

466
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:41,779
had two sensor a little ops back I only

467
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:47,179
had to censor the actual prefix

468
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:47,179
information for legal reasons

469
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:59,000
and a you see there is almost no more

470
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:04,780
than 10% of the number of roots that are

471
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:08,000
in vir are is actually flexed as as

472
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:11,270
original validation invalid that should

473
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,120
not be the case and we are seeing in the

474
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:20,450
bottom three lines actually examples of

475
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,550
root objects from the IRR that are -

476
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:28,580
that better should be ignored

477
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:32,090
according to rpki oops that should not

478
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:34,909
be there and that should not be there or

479
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:38,149
well okay this the these two these two

480
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:40,790
slides were meant as essentially bonus I

481
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:44,660
don't want to talk about it quite

482
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:49,370
obviously there is considerably more to

483
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:53,090
talk about helpful diagnostics beyond

484
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:56,870
what I presented in the UI are there

485
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:59,240
there should be hints and suggested

486
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:03,649
procedures for analysis and improving

487
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:06,850
the data the underlying mechanics of

488
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:09,830
doing the RQ spec and its implementation

489
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:11,990
while okay see and invite me for more

490
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:16,250
detailed presentations or workshops in

491
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:21,520
the future and quite obviously the

492
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:25,420
question of how were when web service

493
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:30,010
might be ready and available for whom

494
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:36,950
would be an interesting point to discuss

495
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:40,040
takeaways I think are our two spec

496
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,850
provides a concise notation for using

497
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,970
rpki

498
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:48,129
and i are our data basis for documenting

499
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:52,130
your customer routes it provides tool

500
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:55,480
for evaluation of this for creating

501
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:58,490
richard ingress route builders and

502
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,010
diagnostics to identify murky spots in

503

ir

504
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:09,150
data to help to help clean up and it

505
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:13,649
occurs creating a for ative data in rpki

506
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:17,940
to be used with priority in conjunction

507
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:30,740
with remaining data from the that is

508
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:33,060
still only covered in the murky IRR and

509
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,300
with that we're actually back on

510
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,300
schedule
