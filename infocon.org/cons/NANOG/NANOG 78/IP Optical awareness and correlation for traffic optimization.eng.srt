1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,210
okay good morning a quick little

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,309
introduction on myself

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,080
a principal consulting engineer for

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,928
Nokia scipy and optical networking

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,940
division my focus is on network

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,369
automation and Sdn controller solutions

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,990
alright quick little background on

8
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,119
myself I've gone through an evolution

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,948
right I mean I think that word gets

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,070
abused and used quite a bit and a lot of

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,070
these discussions but I started to the

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,349
in the industry about 20 years ago okay

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,940
and so over those 20 years I started on

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:38,760
fixed access portfolio alright SONET due

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,790
to the loop carriers ATM then

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,099
transitioned over time to IP type a

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,320
networking infrastructure eventually

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,500
into network management assurance

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,000
capabilities and now into obviously a

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,680
lot of this automation capabilities

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,219
right which is another word that gets

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,660
abused quite a bit alright but a lot of

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,870
the automation as well as the

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,379
optimization capabilities now my intent

25
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,670
for this presentation is not to discuss

26
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:07,530
necessarily collapsing of these domains

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,960
right into one physical domain or

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,689
getting into any type of specific optics

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,389
integration discussion my intent is more

30
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,820
around the value of centralized type of

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,180
hierarchical controllers all right or

32
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,649
software leveraging or providing the

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,280
awareness of course across these

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,020
different layer domains right providing

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,630
a the obviously the linkage between

36
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,950
these domains the infrastructure

37
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,990
awareness across the infrastructure

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,060
weariness of course of the reliability

39
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,679
of each of these domains and leveraging

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,390
all of that to build service

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
infrastructure right across that that

42
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,930
still meets the performance demand right

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,630
especially performance tab and that's

44
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,920
going to be becoming higher and higher

45
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,539
right as we look at these next

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,710
generation of application flows that are

47
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:57,320
coming in okay

48
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:59,839
so taking a little bit of a page off the

49
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,720
book of Prakash's keynote presentation

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,500
yesterday if you were there he mentioned

51
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,619
the some key requirements right as as

52
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,990
cloud IOT and 5g and the horizon are

53
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,850
gonna be impacting this all right and

54
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,260
and to be honest these requirements are

55
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,910
brand new in the industry these

56
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,530
requirements have always been there all

57
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,640
right but he talked about the massive

58
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,770
scalability right

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,660
what has changed there's obviously the

60
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,760
demand the speed of the demand has

61
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,160
increased on capacity he talked about

62
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,649
the horizontal growth capability that

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,829
you need to maintain right to quickly

64
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,570
deliver the obviously platform in a in a

65
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,870
timely manner deliver the service of

66
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,090
course

67
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,320
all right deliver the capacity right for

68
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,240
for faster capacity growth he also

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,920
talked about the capability of obviously

70
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,950
right again that's nothing new but the

71
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,660
reliability aspect of it right that

72
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,980
still hasn't changed you still need to

73
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,240
provide a performance across that

74
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,910
infrastructure approval provide

75
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,220
obviously reliability right across these

76
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,810
different layers right as well as the

77
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,150
security to maintain again that

78
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,880
performance intent for the service and

79
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,250
then lastly obviously where there's been

80
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,859
quite a bit of an evolution is on the

81
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,780
automation side as I said right

82
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,180
whether it's abstraction of the API is

83
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,430
whether it's defining obviously

84
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,640
configuration workflows defining of

85
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,380
course event-driven workflows defining

86
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,970
that intent for that particular service

87
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,730
in that particular infrastructure and

88
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,620
how do we maintain that infrastructure

89
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,160
moving forward right maintain that

90
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,190
infrastructure relevant to the service

91
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,570
ok so I'm not telling you anything new

92
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,890
here right I'm not showing you in

93
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,140
anything new in this particular slide I

94
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,429
think everyone is well aware of

95
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,500
obviously when looking at these

96
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,140
different layers we all understand that

97
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,270
the underlay whatever that underlay is

98
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,070
right has an impact on that particular

99
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,840
overlay infrastructure right it

100
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:54,019
obviously has an impact at a service

101
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,959
itself as an impact of a performance ok

102
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,610
well what's missing here is awareness

103
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,720
awareness of the infrastructure above

104
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,000
and awareness of the infrastructure

105
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,150
below right the correlation isn't there

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,240
today so I'm highlighting a few things

107
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,190
here right

108
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,260
basic questions have come up over the

109
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,600
years and trying to understand all of

110
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,030
this right so for instance is there a

111
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,550
more optimal performance around for

112
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,930
services all right so today obviously

113
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,600
when you're looking at the layer the IP

114
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,950
layer its next-hop right what's not

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,050
being looked at is obviously that

116
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,599
optical infrastructure right that could

117
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,670
that particular IP path that one hop

118
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,220
could be taking a longer path than what

119
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,860
you expected right as a result and

120
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,380
impact of latency okay so how are we

121
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,810
understanding that we're taking most

122
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,500
optimal path for a particular service

123
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,300
infrastructure okay now the other part

124
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,490
that comes up off and it's it's just not

125
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,890
about automation right there's also a

126
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,990
post side of the house it basically how

127
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,240
do I troubleshoot all right how do I

128
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,760
obviously narrow down or decrease that

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,110
time to identify the impact at a service

130
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,150
this is going to become important

131
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,460
obviously in a long term from a

132
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,679
closed-loop type of capability right but

133
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,060
alarm correlation alarm correlation is

134
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,010
always important you need to have that

135
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,390
awareness of all this infrastructure how

136
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,310
do you know that a particular optical

137
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,620
service the performance on that optical

138
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,230
service is what's actually impacting

139
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,540
that MPLS path all right how do you then

140
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:25,470
identify that and then and basically

141
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:28,470
address it the other part there sorry

142
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,550
went ahead a little bit but are these

143
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:34,020
services on a diverse path okay so you

144
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,090
know when you look at these primary and

145
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,280
secondary service infrastructures we

146
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,109
want to ensure this jointness diversity

147
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,380
right we don't want to identify or

148
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,120
leverage a particular link or an

149
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,740
infrastructure that if there's an impact

150
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,540
to it it's going to impact both my

151
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,550
primary and secondary again nothing new

152
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,710
but what's not what's been missing is

153
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,250
obviously that awareness of the optical

154
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:58,409
services underneath last but not least

155
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,910
all right what what services again again

156
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,460
kind of going to that awareness

157
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,780
standpoint right what IP services are

158
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,659
leveraging that at that particular

159
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,750
Lander that particular optical link okay

160
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,610
now I think most of you may know this

161
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,320
maybe not but you know in the great

162
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,090
words of GI Joe I think everybody

163
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,790
understands knowing is half the battle

164
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,919
alright so again it's awareness

165
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,690
understanding what infrastructure

166
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,940
there on that particular optical

167
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,320
infrastructure what IP services what

168
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,180
does the MPLS infrastructure that's

169
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,830
leveraging that in case I need to take

170
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,560
some kind of maintenance proactive a

171
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,349
reactive type of capability across that

172
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,630
right or some what-if predictive and

173
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,910
alice analysis across that right what

174
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,219
what are the optical services if I make

175
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,440
a particular event or a maintenance

176
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,360
window and I address a particular link

177
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,490
what am I going to be impacting I need

178
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,630
to have that do I need to then move that

179
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,860
traffic if possible right so what are

180
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,110
the use cases that's there in the

181
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,360
horizon that's going to be impacting all

182
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:02,040
of this from a transport point of view

183
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,540
is 5g network slicing right why right if

184
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,950
you look at obviously this networks

185
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,790
slicing what does that mean it's

186
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,830
basically stitching of resources across

187
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,770
different segments okay sounds simple

188
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,300
but but when you look at this right when

189
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,919
you look at obviously this resource

190
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,740
allocations for these use cases

191
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,450
all right you have obviously and in

192
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,070
general three different domains to

193
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,190
simplify it you've got a ran

194
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,960
infrastructure you've got a core packet

195
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,460
core infrastructure and then

196
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,900
interconnecting all of this is obviously

197
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,690
these transport into connectivity

198
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,739
services okay but when you look a little

199
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,719
bit further to that then there's

200
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,150
disaggregation at the ramp all right so

201
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,950
now you're breaking that ran component

202
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,719
further right you're virtualizing it

203
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,420
you're introducing more front hall mid

204
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,800
all backhaul I transport services in

205
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,390
between that right you still need to

206
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
maintain performance you have data

207
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,830
center interconnectivity that you've got

208
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,140
to keep in mind within within that

209
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,700
disaggregated ramp right and looking at

210
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,979
the core same thing obviously you've got

211
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,930
data center and connectivity within that

212
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,730
data center or packet core that you've

213
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,620
got to maintain all right and there's

214
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,090
depending on the use case you're peering

215
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,580
points the services the different

216
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,960
customers there's a high level of

217
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,370
obviously service infrastructure that's

218
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,299
going to get created so you've got to

219
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,880
maintain that there's obviously

220
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,410
performance requirements across all of

221
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,200
that infrastructure all right so you

222
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,490
have this high skill transport

223
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,110
infrastructure that's being built out

224
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,180
you've got high requirements on

225
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,530
obviously the performance of each of

226
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,080
that each of those infrastructures now

227
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,669
we've sliced and diced transport

228
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,919
services in the past right this is

229
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,599
nothing new but now when you look at it

230
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,789
right as I mentioned all of those

231
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,019
different segments right whether it's

232
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,569
obviously uh

233
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:42,929
vx land segments routing within a data

234
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,970
center the BGP type of segment routing

235
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:47,189
capabilities that are there right your

236
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,510
hard slicing with photonics right to

237
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,800
looking at the different data centers

238
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,930
that you're going to interconnect with

239
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,639
depending on your cloud exchange connect

240
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,029
right your edge data centers which have

241
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,560
that that disaggregated ramp right so

242
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:01,500
you've got a higher complexity there

243
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,050
that you need a type of transport

244
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,670
control capability alright and just

245
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,519
another thing to keep in mind right as

246
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,680
as 3gpp is you know focused on obviously

247
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,660
this ran and this course licensing and

248
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,489
trying to stitch all of this what's been

249
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,110
lacking to be honest is is that

250
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,399
transports lines standardizing on that

251
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,990
right because at the end of the day

252
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,610
regardless who the vendors underneath

253
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,709
there needs to be a level of abstraction

254
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,019
right as I mentioned automation is an

255
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,849
important key ok so this is going to be

256
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,920
obviously one case on the horizon it's

257
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,670
going to have a big driver from an IP

258
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,319
optical transport capability now over

259
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,660
those recent years obviously there's

260
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,670
been evolution at the device level all

261
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,750
right so we're all well aware of a lot

262
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,519
of the capabilities that have been

263
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,750
introduced right from segment routing

264
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,740
the drive that again high skill

265
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,769
capacities scalability like

266
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,889
configuration right across BGP IGP

267
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:54,990
infrastructures cdcf right to provide

268
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:57,180
wavelength switching or routing right

269
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,180
from a control plane more further

270
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,399
restoration capabilities with gmpls

271
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:05,099
alright so again more capabilities at

272
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,660
the at the actual Kwas functionality I'm

273
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,209
looking at deterministic waz and looking

274
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,160
at the minimum resources deliver those

275
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,630
particular services right for the

276
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,480
traffic engineering right with

277
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,430
capabilities like Pisa in being able to

278
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,649
look at holistically across a a

279
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,339
particular service or particular path

280
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:22,740
end-to-end

281
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,959
right and with that right and a lot of

282
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,000
this capability you need the

283
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,279
programmable interfaces right you need

284
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,720
the data mining capabilities so there's

285
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,959
been an evolution there and right we've

286
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,089
gone model capabilities with regards to

287
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,510
yang modeling right that introduces net

288
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,839
conf

289
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,300
that introduces your PC GMI type of

290
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,769
interfaces piece effective interfaces

291
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,900
like I mentioned already to be able to

292
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,730
automate that MPLS infrastructure

293
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,980
path computation functionality across

294
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,970
that right and again the data mining

295
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,620
right the data mined it becomes

296
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,210
important here as obviously we're

297
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,320
looking at not only being able to

298
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,060
automate this but then we've got to

299
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,260
maintain and ensure those particular

300
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,089
infrastructures are meeting the

301
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,650
performance dates all right so I need to

302
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,360
look at data there's a lot of data

303
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,180
coming in now but I want to put the

304
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,160
intelligence on the device to provide

305
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,949
that data to me right to provide that

306
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,569
KPI that we're hitting okay so rather

307
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,310
than that pole type of mechanisms it's

308
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,170
now the intelligence is there to push

309
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:20,489
that utilization detail or the

310
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,689
performance issue now likewise there's

311
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,060
an evolution that's been happening on

312
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,880
that vertical IT stack right so I know

313
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,829
I'm showing present mode I like to look

314
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,960
at his past mode of operation but it's

315
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,390
still present all right so when you look

316
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,110
at you know obviously the different

317
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,939
domains

318
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,100
you've got integration to each of these

319
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,450
domains you've got different vendor

320
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,450
integration to each of these domains

321
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:46,290
maybe to a management system right maybe

322
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:48,450
direct into a particular vendors device

323
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:51,270
all right so what does that mean that's

324
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:54,060
obviously configuration issues high cost

325
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,560
of OSS integration all right

326
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,750
there's in correlation there between

327
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,369
between all of that so when you look at

328
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,360
obviously some of these OSS systems that

329
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,710
have been they're trying to put that

330
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,630
correlation with her from

331
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,760
troubleshooting a fault management it's

332
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:08,220
it's very costly right to map all of

333
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,480
this and there's heavy heavy errors that

334
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,280
always come in from a configuration

335
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,350
standpoint when looking at these this

336
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,000
current solution we're what have we done

337
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,100
obviously there's been a collapse right

338
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,680
you're taking that control plane

339
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,900
awareness right you're taking those

340
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,060
management capabilities you're taking

341
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,579
this this model functionality of

342
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,199
abstracting these interfaces when

343
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,390
collapsing it into these domain

344
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,870
controllers why you want to abstract

345
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:37,020
that interface leveraging standards

346
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:39,180
alright like tapi ITF certain IETF

347
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,829
standards that are there to integrate

348
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,199
into these n10 service orchestrators

349
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,330
right to simplify whatever that domain

350
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,070
controller needs to focus on right for

351
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,140
that in service controller I want to be

352
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,630
able to just say hey I need a path

353
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,850
between n point 1 and point 2 and this

354
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,170
is my SLA right that should be

355
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,150
abstracted you let that domain

356
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,790
controller figure out the infrastructure

357
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,520
figure out what it

358
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,140
needs to maintain that performance right

359
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,370
and build it out and then what does it

360
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,900
need to obviously maintain the

361
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:10,520
reliability of that infrastructure okay

362
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,579
so what are some benefits or to be

363
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,910
honest more more around expectations my

364
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,250
operators for a multi multi layer type

365
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,050
of solution all right you can break it

366
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,860
into these three pillars in my opinion

367
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,349
right

368
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,960
it's simplifying the operation all right

369
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,250
again there's a post a pre and post side

370
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,870
of the house right I want to be able to

371
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,550
to maintain I want to be able to

372
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,530
troubleshoot I want to be able to do

373
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:37,550
what if type of analysis I want to

374
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:40,010
understand if I knock a particular link

375
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,140
down right what what services will I

376
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,460
impact what IP infrastructure will not

377
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,920
impact as well right there needs to be

378
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,140
that correlation there I want to be able

379
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,290
to have a coordinated maintenance right

380
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,699
capability what do I mean by that

381
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,339
obviously not having that awareness of

382
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,020
what the IP infrastructure that's

383
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,670
overriding that over way across that

384
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,230
particular optical infrastructure I

385
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,579
don't know what services I would be

386
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,950
impacting right first you want to have

387
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,700
that awareness but second if I do know

388
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,830
that I'm gonna have a maintenance

389
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,050
activity maybe I want to gracefully move

390
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:13,130
those flows right rather than letting

391
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:15,380
fast reroute all right or LF a reroute

392
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,960
that infrastructure based on what it

393
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,450
perceives as the best next hop I'd

394
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,970
rather have a view of what the in a path

395
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:25,310
should be for the particular LSP for

396
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,230
instance and define a maintenance and

397
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,280
then define okay here's where I will

398
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:33,800
move that LSP to address the performance

399
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,959
also resiliency right so each each layer

400
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,849
has an expectation from a performance

401
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,950
and expectation for resilience all right

402
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,930
you have a CH a capabilities at each of

403
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,520
these layers all right but I want to be

404
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,150
able to to leverage obviously

405
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,680
information at these layers but also

406
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,240
identify that let's say there's a

407
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,680
restoration event that that's occurred

408
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,530
right or there's an issue that occurred

409
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,910
in an optical link and then leveraged

410
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,439
and maybe gmpls there's going to be a

411
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,750
possible restoration is going to happen

412
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,370
there do I want to move infrastructure

413
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,170
back that's already been that's already

414
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,330
been moved all right do I want to give

415
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,699
it a little bit of a timer to take a

416
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,710
look all right are we going to go back

417
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,230
into an optical infrastructure or

418
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,570
particular link that is having some

419
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,700
powerlevel issues right which is then

420
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,760
gonna cause obviously the surface impact

421
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:22,430
again potentially right the other thing

422
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,020
to look at is obviously correlation of

423
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,939
all that information right taking a look

424
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,710
at latency information as well as the

425
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,350
shared risk group type of details at

426
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,480
each link at each hop or their IP or

427
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,030
optical and then last but not least

428
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,140
right the utilization so I'm looking at

429
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,550
utilization I want to be able to run

430
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,830
hotter right I want to be able to

431
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,300
obviously as things are scaling I also

432
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,260
want to be able to add that right I

433
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,469
wanna have the path computation

434
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,990
capability to adjust right being able to

435
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,750
spread traffic across across these new

436
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,330
new links or paralleling so of course

437
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,280
any new link to a new Janu aspiring

438
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,560
writer right so you need that capability

439
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,900
to address that right from a computation

440
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,479
standpoint but you also need to deal

441
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,640
with obviously certain failure scenarios

442
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,080
as mentioned before all right

443
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,270
rather than having a one to one

444
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,100
redundancy which becomes pretty pretty

445
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,230
costly maybe you might want to have a

446
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,810
one to end in which identify particular

447
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:18,110
lag group in instances as a highlight

448
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,089
here and if there's a particular port

449
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,430
maybe taking advantage of a port or link

450
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:25,130
failure and leverage these workflow

451
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,630
capabilities right based on events such

452
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:29,330
as a state change to a particular link

453
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,520
and then modify the particularly group

454
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,650
to leverage a backup type of interface

455
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,079
to still maintain that utilization all

456
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,329
right as well as modifying obviously the

457
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,460
optical service right to modify the new

458
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,870
optical service to map it to obviously

459
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,240
your optical trail that you had

460
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:49,970
associated and the previous the previous

461
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,710
connectivity okay now so within Nokia

462
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,110
we've been focusing on some of these use

463
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,060
cases right how do we address this right

464
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,000
what are some use cases to start with

465
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,439
move forward and build on obviously this

466
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,480
correlation between these different

467
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,740
layers obviously this is still a

468
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,880
starting point that's going to be growth

469
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,650
that's gonna be happening here as I

470
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,600
mentioned with a lot of this intent

471
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,130
based networking that's coming in being

472
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,990
able to define machine learning

473
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,580
functionalities that are coming in and

474
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,349
there's use cases that are being defined

475
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,000
there and how how will the network learn

476
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,530
and how will we adapt so there's going

477
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,130
to be a growth here but we've started so

478
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,270
far on this right on this path and so

479
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,070
some of them I'm gonna go through some

480
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,760
of these but the first one this is the

481
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,619
critical one

482
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,350
opinion right this is setting the stage

483
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:34,219
again it's that awareness right it's

484
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:37,189
that linkage right and today most many

485
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,020
operators that are out there still have

486
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,450
spreadsheets right still have

487
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,160
spreadsheets of IG p lengths that are

488
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,020
mapped to particular optical services

489
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,880
and they're trying to leverage that

490
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,160
information to look at performance on

491
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,990
these optical links and then hopefully

492
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,000
then manipulate traffic engineering

493
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,550
metrics to influence where traffic

494
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,410
should go right so there's a heavy

495
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,180
spreadsheets that are out there and this

496
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,040
is not a tear through tear to I know

497
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,540
there's global operators that are out

498
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,520
there that are still maintaining it in

499
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,020
this way and you know you know who you

500
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,970
are if you're here right if you have

501
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,260
some of the type of capacity management

502
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,320
going on today

503
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,550
right but ideally I'd like to obviously

504
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,040
have a real-time view right have a

505
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,180
stateful view of that infrastructure all

506
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,300
right but but the key is that

507
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,280
correlation that connection of that

508
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,620
those two domains all right there's

509
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,060
different ways of doing that right

510
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,709
mapping that particular client interface

511
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,990
on the optical service that I IP

512
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,800
interface you can manually do that but

513
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,290
really you need to start taking

514
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,970
deterministic type of approaches right

515
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,590
in some of the solutions that have been

516
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,170
there so the initial ones are leveraging

517
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,879
for instance lldp snooping right

518
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:43,790
being able to sniff obviously that

519
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,830
particular LDP transaction going between

520
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,270
two different routers and identifying

521
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,840
the two endpoints so that way we can

522
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,950
automatically then identify the linkage

523
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,959
others could be obviously looking at

524
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,580
packet counts right looking at the

525
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,260
packet count on the IP interface looking

526
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,270
at the pack packing count on the optical

527
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,340
client interface and looking over a

528
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,139
period of time to match that it could be

529
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,990
power levels right looking at the power

530
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,240
level of obviously the egress and the

531
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,010
router and the ingress of a particular

532
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,830
client or facing able to switch and be

533
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,180
able to again match that right to be

534
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,350
able to provide that because once you

535
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,690
define that connection

536
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,250
you're basically now have correlated

537
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,770
your Reformation correlating your layer

538
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,390
3 interface that on optical service now

539
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,220
you now know at that optical service

540
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,840
here are the ODU channels here is your

541
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,450
your DD billion service that's tied to

542
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,490
that client interface you now know one

543
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,960
that IP interface what layer three

544
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,000
services are associated you know what

545
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,430
MPLS infrastructure is leveraging that

546
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,780
interface so now you've tied your IP

547
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,880
service you've tied your

548
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,470
your MPLS infrastructure - you're

549
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,520
obviously client interface to that

550
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:48,650
optical service okay so that starts that

551
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,330
starts the baseline for everything some

552
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,770
other use cases are optically a disjoint

553
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:57,590
IP routing alright so I talked about

554
00:19:53,770 --> 00:20:00,230
diversity right and being able to look

555
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:02,330
at not only obviously your IP layer and

556
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,670
providing diversity across these IP

557
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,230
links but understanding diversity across

558
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,840
the optical links as well being able to

559
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,250
identify these shared risk groups that

560
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,350
these optical services are are

561
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,780
traversing all right being able to take

562
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,090
that information and then influence the

563
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,530
IP infrastructure that IP path right if

564
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:23,540
you're looking for diversity complete

565
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:25,460
diversity across all of these links okay

566
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,280
the other part to that is obviously an

567
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,950
auditing capability right so it's one

568
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,740
thing to obviously define an algorithm

569
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,810
to avoid obviously these shared risk

570
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,700
groups or shared risk links right for

571
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,590
your primary and secondary paths but

572
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,240
then there's also the obviously this

573
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,090
infrastructure that's already there how

574
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,980
do I go in and basically audit is there

575
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,590
diversity in a particular IP service

576
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,110
right is there diversity on these links

577
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,790
right on these optical links do I have

578
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,709
optical what are what are the optical

579
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,080
services that are obviously going across

580
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,820
the particular link right what are the

581
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,520
IP services that are sharing a

582
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,720
particular resource again understanding

583
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,600
what's going across that way then I can

584
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,630
define a leveraging a disjoint type of

585
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,649
algorithm to either do no link

586
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,420
disjointness not only at the IP layer

587
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:15,980
but I've also composed the optical layer

588
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:17,750
as well ok and this one I talked about a

589
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:21,770
moments ago coordinated operational

590
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,600
control right so obviously there's a

591
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,310
maintenance event on a particular link

592
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,949
right we want the operator to have the

593
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:29,990
ability to identify what are the

594
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,400
services what are the IP infrastructures

595
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,470
that are going to be going across the

596
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,060
link right that's the first part but we

597
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,150
want to have the capability of a

598
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:40,340
proactive or reactive ability to move

599
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,530
that infrastructure right not letting a

600
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,360
particular all of a sudden then do as I

601
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,830
mentioned before a fast reroute Ornella

602
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,540
fee of that particular infrastructure

603
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,189
right which is only going to take that

604
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,129
next top neucom remember there's SLA is

605
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,230
defined to that path

606
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,600
doesn't intent to that path I'd rather

607
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:59,020
the controller right in that maintenance

608
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,899
mode setting basically defined here's my

609
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,580
my MPLS paths that are there I know the

610
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,280
constraints associated with those MPLS

611
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,500
paths let me compute a path and move

612
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,450
that infrastructure now it could be a

613
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,220
manual or an automated approach right

614
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,960
but again I want to identify that

615
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,150
infrastructure and then give the

616
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,250
operator either a manual approach to

617
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,679
move that all right without impacting

618
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,970
the service or an automated way with the

619
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,860
control of the IP controller to move

620
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:28,780
that infrastructure across okay now cost

621
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,360
effective multi-layer protection right

622
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:34,299
this is what I was talking about load

623
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,789
sharing or are floating ports right in

624
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:38,740
an earlier slide and I talked about

625
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:41,080
obviously this one-to-one protection

626
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:44,799
right do you have you've defined a

627
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,449
particular ecmp path or a lag group and

628
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,580
obviously if you wanted full protection

629
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,350
one to one you've got another interface

630
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,539
that you define or a group of interfaces

631
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,090
that you define obviously this becomes

632
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:56,470
costly and so some solutions that we've

633
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,320
been working on with operators is

634
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,730
identifying a backup port right an

635
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,530
optical link that's already there that

636
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,659
could be leveraged across these

637
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,270
different lag interfaces all right the

638
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:09,220
intent is again leveraging this intent

639
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,799
driven or workflow event-driven

640
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,419
capability identify that there's a state

641
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,668
change to a particular link a link has

642
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:18,250
gone down take advantage that backup

643
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:20,590
port manipulate the particular lag

644
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,270
member Association manipulate the

645
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,490
optical service to now be tied to that

646
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,710
new optical that new client interface

647
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,360
that's tied to that backup port again

648
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:32,650
it's a workflow based solution to

649
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,899
leverage that across there there's what

650
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,059
if type of scenarios right again this is

651
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,429
the Stark but I look at this is more

652
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:42,730
eventually traffic engineering capacity

653
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:44,289
planning type of scenarios but again it

654
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,510
goes to these maintenance windows all

655
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:48,789
right having an understanding when I go

656
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,260
to a maintenance window alright and I

657
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:51,429
want to simulate these particular

658
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,590
failures or I want to simulate the

659
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,049
worst-case failure right and the impact

660
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,780
to that as I look at it any type of

661
00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:00,309
matrix demand matrix capabilities need

662
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,658
to have the simulation functionality

663
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:04,210
right you need to have full awareness of

664
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:04,930
all of your infrastructure on both IP

665
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,580
and optical

666
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,920
you need to be able to then obviously I

667
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,879
have everything correlated together all

668
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,120
right but now then you could take that

669
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,690
capability identify a particular link

670
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,709
understand what are the IP

671
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,840
infrastructures that are gonna be

672
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,640
impacted and then be able to identify

673
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,500
rule the controllers be able to

674
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,660
manipulate move the infrastructure to

675
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:29,260
still meet those algorithms or policies

676
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:31,060
defined for those paths okay I mentioned

677
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,970
hierarchal right it's not hierarchical

678
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,980
just from a IP and optical standpoint

679
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,770
it's hierarchical across across the the

680
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,450
same domain as well right there there

681
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,410
could be particular IGP domains and

682
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,140
there's different ways of addressing

683
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,640
that but with optical you're gonna have

684
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,970
obviously different vendor domains as

685
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,400
well so you may have a Nokia optical

686
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,230
domain you may have a Fujitsu domain

687
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,180
that's there but the intent here is to

688
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,430
be able to sit across that leverage

689
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,740
these abstract interfaces that are being

690
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:02,410
defined is for instance in onf and

691
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,120
defining this transport API or I

692
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,700
provided that abstract capability to

693
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,500
create the stitching between these

694
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,610
different domains all right so that way

695
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,320
you could be interfacing these

696
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,219
controllers could be interfacing with an

697
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:21,610
NMS or a controller for each of those

698
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:23,620
optic or vendor optical domains now I

699
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,760
mentioned earlier right as I mentioned

700
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,469
her there's also the troubleshooting

701
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,000
aspect of it right it's not just

702
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,740
automation you need to be able to

703
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,750
maintain this you need to be able to

704
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,220
have your operate operators be able to

705
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,570
troubleshoot this network so if it comes

706
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,640
down to route calls analysis the

707
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:38,260
correlation as well I've identified

708
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,910
obviously we're we're focused on

709
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,360
correlating all of this information end

710
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,100
to end

711
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,169
obviously that's very relevant to

712
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,780
building and maintaining in influencing

713
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,070
the infrastructure but at the end I also

714
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,570
want to have the ability since I've got

715
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,659
all this correlation to provide route

716
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,189
costs across across these domains right

717
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,050
instead of just throwing something over

718
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,380
the fence I can't figure out why a

719
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:01,389
particular LSP is down or I'm dropping

720
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,640
traffic on an LSP I don't know it's

721
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,050
impacting a particular service right I

722
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,310
need the ability to understand that you

723
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,600
know the impact that we're seeing here

724
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,250
is being caused by a particular

725
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,139
performance issue on the lambda

726
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:16,360
wavelength right I can encorage Anette

727
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,500
to the actual LSP is the services that

728
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,260
are leveraging that

729
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:23,560
narrow down that troubleshooting time

730
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:26,650
okay now last but not least right it's

731
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,149
this evolution path and you we've

732
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,770
started down this path already and with

733
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,890
Enochian trying to leverage machine

734
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:35,110
learning right this AI this capability

735
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:38,560
of learning right being able to have a

736
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:40,600
some feed information at being able to

737
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,419
obviously take all this data this large

738
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,350
volume of information identify patterns

739
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,150
right

740
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,949
identify how we can address those

741
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,990
patterns right as we're looking at all

742
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,810
these events coming in all of the

743
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:55,060
utilization data the intent there is

744
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:58,149
okay now let's identify these patterns

745
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:00,580
right identify the actions that have

746
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:03,340
addressed pad these identify patterns in

747
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,770
the past these situations and then

748
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,800
moving forward identify obviously these

749
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,980
baselines of utilization all right some

750
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,870
of the KPIs across the infrastructure

751
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,670
identified then potential workflows that

752
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:18,250
closed-loop type of capability and and

753
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:20,080
learning having the operator still have

754
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,300
the feedback loop there that he can

755
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,830
obviously make a decision based on some

756
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,389
feedback that's provided based on

757
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,189
information that we learned under the

758
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,680
apology state performance information

759
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,840
right all of this data that's coming in

760
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,850
alright so this is where we're we're

761
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,290
going right especially as further and

762
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,179
further right there's evolution in that

763
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,530
intent based networking all right you're

764
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,420
defining these intents on these

765
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,860
infrastructure these services now let's

766
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,340
start leveraging the data that's coming

767
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,179
in and providing that self-driving

768
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,560
capability right so this is what we've

769
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,540
started already our float our first

770
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,280
focus was around obviously identifying

771
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,990
patterns of issues that are going on

772
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,700
all right so that way we can identify to

773
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,630
the operators these are this is a

774
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,430
similar pattern

775
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:59,230
all right that's causing a network

776
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,790
flapping issue so instead of looking at

777
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,580
thousands of events you're looking at

778
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:05,530
maybe 2030 situations that have been

779
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,139
identified that are meeting this

780
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,300
particular pattern okay and then give

781
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,950
the operator some choices on how they

782
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,210
want to address it so this is our first

783
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:18,430
implementation but then it's going to go

784
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:19,870
further from there okay so just to

785
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,340
obviously kind of bring this all

786
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,100
together a little bit right and looking

787
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,360
at the benefits our focus is obviously

788
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,090
and I think everyone's focus is

789
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,870
obviously simplifying operations all

790
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,220
right

791
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,969
decreasing in providing the toolset

792
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,429
that are there to provide that

793
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,870
correlation across this by providing the

794
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:38,630
interconnectivity across the service

795
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,918
infrastructures increased network

796
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,030
utilization right we talked about

797
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,820
large-scale

798
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:45,918
adding more spine routers or adding more

799
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,689
infrastructure to handle obviously the

800
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,490
the particular services and the demand

801
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,320
that's coming in you need to have

802
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:53,210
obviously the capabilities to compute

803
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,770
that infrastructure and maintain that

804
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,570
right one thing I didn't mention is you

805
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,280
know we talked about this growth you

806
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,928
know let's say a leaf spying type of

807
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,370
architecture but with that you're

808
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:03,380
spreading traffic across the network

809
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:06,020
potentially right you need to be able to

810
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,970
identify let's say black hole type of

811
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,860
events now that you're you're spreading

812
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,240
traffic across the network how do you

813
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,590
identify that there's an event that's

814
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,659
occurring that's dropping traffic

815
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:18,559
somewhere that you can now address it

816
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:20,120
and then avoid that particular path so

817
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,129
you need to have that stateful awareness

818
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,110
across need to have topology detail

819
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:28,070
obviously you need to have utilization

820
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,418
information as well coming in network

821
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,139
resiliency as I mentioned right we're

822
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,970
looking at all these different

823
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:35,270
resiliency capabilities that have been

824
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:37,010
introduced over both on the IP side and

825
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,720
obviously on the optical side would you

826
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,539
MPLS and some des capabilities there

827
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,010
with cdcf and the flexibility right

828
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:44,450
being able to take all of that into

829
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,919
account and be able to make your

830
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,840
decisions all right on that

831
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,280
infrastructure and then speeding up

832
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,350
planning and processing right as I

833
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,000
mentioned these what if these demand

834
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,620
matrix capabilities and looking at

835
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,659
whether the capacity is there to handle

836
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,489
failure scenarios or worst-case failure

837
00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:00,320
scenarios right and look at

838
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,210
predictability of how much services you

839
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,539
can add potentially where do you need to

840
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,980
add potential scale right as well as

841
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:08,629
obviously speeding up the agility of

842
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,340
introducing these services right as

843
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:12,409
mentioned in these presentations the

844
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,928
automation aspect the modeling the

845
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:19,250
abstract modeling right the workflows to

846
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:21,289
deliver those configurations okay and I

847
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,850
think I think that's all that I've got I

848
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:27,280
know I've kind of gone above a little

849
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,280
bit at the time are there any questions

850
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,610
with that I know them before lunch so

851
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:38,710
thank you for the time obviously there's

852
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,479
