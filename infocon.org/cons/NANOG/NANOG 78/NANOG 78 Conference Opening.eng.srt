00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,009
good morning good morning it's sure the

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,199
sounds all right we're getting the clock

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,559
all set for this opening presentation so

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,170
I wanted to say welcome thank you for

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,039
participating in an ox ebony

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,480
I'm really excited that we're in San

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,570

committee we got a great program of

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,050
talks tutorials in panels so I think

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,160
whether you're new or old attendee

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,040
you'll find something very interesting

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,610
on the agenda and I'm just really

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,809
excited to have that for us

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,450
also the nanoq staff has worked very

17
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,718
hard to have spaces available in this

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,410
hotel for discussions

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,270
unfortunately there appears to be an

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,069
issue with one of the escalators but if

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,199
you make it up to the lobby or atrium

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,149
level there's a lot of seating around

23
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,039
that area for holding meetings we do

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,789
have some open seating we have an

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,800
espresso bar out across this floor and

26
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,680
meals will be downstairs so there's a

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,200
lot of things available for you they've

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,189
provided break refreshments will have

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,070
meals and the Bering gear event tomorrow

30
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,258
and a social this evening so thank you I

31
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,860
hope you enjoy that and take advantage

32
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,619
of that so first of all there's a lot of

members to help out DNS or preceded this

43
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,750
meeting with their own meeting over the

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,729
weekend as well as the nanoq hackathon

45
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,350
so thank you to the participants of

46
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,060

media feeds and find out a little bit

51
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,610
more about park and the hackathon that

52
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,610
we ourselves host

53
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,710
all right finally thank you to the Nanak

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:21,200
sponsors the sponsors support Nanak's

55
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:25,610
mission they allow us to not only put on

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,070
this meeting but also to tailor programs

57
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,370
to the operators of tomorrow do further

58
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,320

59
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,880
the hog meetings so thank you to the

60
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,209
sponsors first of all our hackathon

61
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:42,560
sponsors our host and connectivity

62
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:45,080
sponsors our webcast sponsor make it

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,920
possible for folks that are remote to

64
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:52,459
participate and think in our premium

65
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,899
sponsors lastly I do want to thank the

66
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,850
nanog members those that are in

67
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,400
attendance and those that are watching

68
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,410
on the webcast they're a major part of

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,970
nanak and as part of the february

70
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,400
meeting the nanak board appoints new

71
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,660
program committee members i think Vince

72
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,250
will cover a little bit about what the

73
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,620
program committee does and how they came

74
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,110
up with the agenda but if there's anyone

75
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,980
that's interested in volunteering

76
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,260
participating on program committee

77
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,660
find a four door program kiddy committee

78
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,640
member and thank you especially to those

79
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,600
members that are here supporting Nia

80
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,250
Nagi and also watching on the webcast so

81
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,130
without further ado I would like to

82
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,170
reduce Tom Daly who is our host sponsor

83
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,790
from fastly and that will be followed by

84
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,940
Vince who's going to kick off the nanak

85
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,840
78 program so welcome thank you and

really excited to have my first

91
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,019
experience as an analyst we are really

92
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,750
jazzed to have you all here in San

93
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,189
Francisco the fastly team is here if

94
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,579
there's anything we can do to make your

95
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:04,108
experience great let us know so welcome

96
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,359
to San Francisco five million human

97
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:09,469
beings in the Bay Area here it's

98
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,980
hometown to fastly HQ were over by AT&T

99
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:12,689
ballpark

100
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,090
now while this may be fast Lee's

101
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:16,680
hometown San Francisco is not my

102
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,019
hometown so I don't know the area that

103
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,509
well so this morning what I'd like to

104
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,099
ask of the audience here is if you're

105
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:25,590
from the Bay Area could you just please

106
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:30,570
stand up so that way we know who all of

107
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:32,820
our locals are excellent and for those

108
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,409
of you sitting down turn around look at

109
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,810
who's standing up these are the people

110
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,509
that can guide us through San Francisco

111
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,340
as we're having a great time there's a

112
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:42,870
lot to do here there's the Embarcadero

113
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,929
there's the Golden Gate Bridge

114
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,550
there's Alcatraz there's I have spent

115
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,500
some time in the city there's exquisite

116
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,300
dining across the entire city and

117
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,900
there's lots of innovative tech

118
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,760
companies to explore and go check out I

119
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,919
want to tell you a little bit about

120
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,310
fastly on our edge cloud platform so we

121
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,080
started in 2011 to rethink the approach

122
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,409
to content delivery networks site

123
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,359
delivery streaming and API gateways we

124
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:11,669
enable customers to build really fast

125
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,340
enjoyable and delightful online

126
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:16,380
experiences that are deeply rooted in

127
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,520
trust and we do that with a software

128
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,320
engineers mindset in minds with agility

129
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,960
and control as some of the first

130
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,150
principles that we go after so the edge

131
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,250
is this extension to the central cloud

132
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,620
it's a neutral it's a natural place for

133
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,300
us to innovate and we think that moving

134
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,130
workloads whether it be from the

135
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,800
traditional enterprise data center or

136
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,889
from a cloud service provider creates an

137
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,090
opportunity to leverage the edge and a

138
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,490
lot of people ask us well where do you

139
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,710
think the edges our CTO Tyler McMullen

140
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,509
says the edges the place the natural

141
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,760
place where you lose control over your

142
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:53,400
users experience and so we think of that

143
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,560
as the pop network of the

144
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,989
network of pops that we've built out so

145
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,570
fastly you can help bridge users to the

146
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,699
central cloud by offering programmable

147
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,310
real time instant compute secure compute

148
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,550
resources at that natural interaction

149
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,460
point therefore driving a far more ideal

150
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,699
online experience I want to emphasize

151
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,430
that we've built fastly xej cloud for

152
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:20,270
software engineers that means that it is

153
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,919
highly programmable so today you can run

154
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,810
applications in varnish configuration

155
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,180
language or VCL and in the near future

156
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,919
you'll be able to run applications in a

157
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,199
programming language at the edge called

158
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,389
rust so this allows you to build

159
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,150
purpose-built applications such as edge

160
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:38,580
redirects authentication a be testing

161
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,650
feature flagging and more without all

162
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,050
those calls going back to your central

163
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,729
data center or to the cloud we enable

164
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,560
that with real-time visibility so you

165
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:49,469
can see what's happening it's not some

166
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,780
black box and our one network philosophy

167
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,820
means that we give you a single platform

168
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,190
to do everything there's no complicated

169
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,560
segmentation of your workloads and your

170
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,090
media assets one of the things that I

171
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,400
think is really cool about what we've

172
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,979
accomplished so far it fastly is that

173
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,130
we've built this one network on top of

174
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:11,099
the services and capabilities of the

175
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,930
entire nanog community and that's taken

176
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:15,060
a lot of partnership with many folks

177
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,010
that are in this room and so I want to

178
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,199
use this opportunity to thank all of the

179
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:23,070
partners that fastly has been able to

180
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:27,120
work with as a result of engaging with

181
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:29,219
us at events like Nanog and so it helps

182
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,740
me sort of transition my talking points

183
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,260
over to why we think the nanog ecosystem

184
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,659
is so important and why we're so happy

185
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,820
to be your host sponsor there's really

186
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:40,260
sort of three key points about nanog and

187
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,520
I just wanted everyone in this room I

188
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:45,360
think knows these but I think it's

189
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,330
important to reiterate them the entire

190
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,120
premise of nanog is education and the

191
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,169
ability for us to engage with

192
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,360
knowledgeable people to share ideas to

193
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:56,219
get constructive feedback and criticisms

194
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,650
about what it is we're trying to do out

195
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,090
on the Internet is a massive benefit to

196
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,799
us in showing up in Nanog and we hope

197
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,260
that benefit extends to you all as well

198
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,410
as you know nano creates a huge forum

199
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,960
for community again a place where we can

200
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,660
exchange ideas where we can touch our

201
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,120
network partners for conversations

202
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,370
discussions to kick off new projects and

203
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,930
really maintain and grow these key

204
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,970
relationships that we have across the

205
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,770
industry and it's always nice when

206
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,630
you're talking to someone over email

207
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,520
about what's going on on the Internet to

208
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,650
have that face to have had that personal

209
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,630
connection but then we have things like

210
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,250
banana Nanog mailing lists which create

211
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,880
a forum for us to do good on the

212
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,799
internet every single day so again this

213
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,900
is what we feel that we get out of nanog

214
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,510
and it's why we're excited to come in as

215
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,270
a host sponsor we think that this

216
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,220
ecosystem is incredibly powerful so if

217
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,140
you're a first-timer I want to welcome

218
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,450
you to nanog prepare to interact with a

219
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,370
really special community that builds

220
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,110
something at a global scale and if

221
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,000
you're an analog veteran I invite you to

222
