1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:09,090
Susy let's women's tech for him my Mike

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,309
women's tech forum was established about

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,379
three years ago and it was a group of us

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,000
from within the industry and we define

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,279
our part of the industry as cloud

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,509
infrastructure so the women who are

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,279
building the cloud and powering the

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,189
Internet and it really started with four

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,859
of us who got together for a drink at

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,349
PTC about as I said three years ago and

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,429
we decided well why don't we try and see

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,949
if there's any other women who'd be

13
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,530
interested in this and over the three

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,140
years or so we've grown to 750 women

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,850
strong we're very much centered around

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,270
the industry conferences that include

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,890
PTC ITW capacity Europe I think we're

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,539
about to launch into doing some work

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,760
with Nanog this year that would be one

20
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,829
of our goals for sure and it's really a

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,079
forum and an opportunity for the women

22
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,760
within our industry to network and meet

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,379
people that they might not otherwise do

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,339
so that they might not have the

25
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:02,699
opportunity so it's generally and those

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,760
on the buy side the sell side peering

27
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,920
engineering and yeah it's great very

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,930
much a grassroots effort but it's going

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,200
from strength to strength thank you

30
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,110
that's perfect timing okay so welcome

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,939
I'm Dave Temkin I'll have the panelists

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,290
introduce themselves in a moment I

33
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,929
wanted just real quick

34
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,920
you can set some background for why

35
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,880
we're here and what we're going to talk

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,320
about I'm going to put this slide up

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,789
it's not germane to what we're going to

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,429
talk about today it's germane to what we

39
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,310
talked about last time which was nanog

40
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,030
and Austin which was very focused around

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,369
inclusion and how do we bring people in

42
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,200
to this environment and how do we we

43
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,590
help them thrive and we talked a lot

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,110
about the different dimensions of what

45
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,960
makes what what could and what would

46
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,189
help make now not more diverse I happen

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,820
to notice this I had nothing to do with

48
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,070
it

49
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,639
aside from when I was registering I

50
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,070
noticed that we're collecting gender

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,649
information and I was like wow that is

52
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,630
fantastic and I took a quick screen tap

53
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,300
of it and I tweeted and just you know

54
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,660
basically gave Nana the organization a

55
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,690
virtual pat on the back for it and

56
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,250
a person who is a friend who absolutely

57
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,790
has everyone's best interest at heart

58
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,990
asks why ask anymore at this point is

59
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,170
that information needed for something

60
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,030
within the org in the event and yes so

61
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,790
if you're asking yourself that question

62
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,440
why we don't know what the

63
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,690
representation is in this room unless we

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,609
ask because people need to tell us and

65
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,530
we don't know how effective these

66
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,690
discussions are unless we have some

67
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,120
amount of metrics to guide them so just

68
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,370
wanted to say that you know this is

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,100
super important as we talk about the

70
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,020
type of people that we are after which

71
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,150
is to get new people in the room and I'm

72
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,330
really excited to talk about this with

73
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,270
our panelists so real quick

74
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,120
Susie you introduced yourself already

75
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:02,820
but what I would ask you is who is one

76
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,850
person in your life that you can point

77
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,260
back to that that they are why you're

78
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,540
here today

79
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,459
great so again Susie Gleason I also work

80
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,459
my day job as I work for digital Realty

81
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,170
I'm on the sale side and I'm also a

82
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,580
co-founder of the Women's Leadership

83
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,200
Forum which is the Women's Network

84
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,370
within digital Realty because when I

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,890
joined there three and a half years ago

86
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,600
there wasn't one and so I felt it was

87
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,119
important that we try and get something

88
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,030
established internally I've spent my

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,910
entire career in this industry from

90
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,100
buying and selling switch minutes to

91
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:38,430
selling wavelengths IP and all the way

92
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,650
through to data centers the one of the

93
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,600
most pivotal points for me was when I

94
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,100
was working in London many many years

95
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,190
ago and I was fortunate enough to win a

96
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,660
green card in the lottery that I had a

97
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,310
boss that I worked for at AT&T who

98
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,799
really gave me that opportunity to come

99
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,739
to the u.s. she sponsored me over here

100
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,420
and got me established so that I could

101
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,980
really start my career here so when I

102
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,690
think back that was probably one of the

103
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,220
most pivotal moments for me I I'm Nick

104
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,050
McEwen I am a professor of computer

105
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,950
science and electrical engineering at

106
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,959
Stanford and I'm also an escapee from

107
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,108
London and came here about thirty

108
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,680
actually thirty years ago this year and

109
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:24,729
the but but I trace my interest in in or

110
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,490
the pivotal point for me I

111
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,890
a Koreas counselor when I was in high

112
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,430
school growing up in England England at

113
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:37,120
that time still not known for a very

114
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:39,340
large tech industry and my career's

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,460
counselor said to me why would you want

116
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,349
to go into engineering you you're smart

117
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,539
why why don't you do something creative

118
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,080
and interesting do you want to fix

119
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,660
trains for the rest of your life I went

120
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,590
through a very good public state school

121
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:59,470
and I think for the next year I was

122
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,599
gonna demo show him and it was one of

123
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,660
the biggest drivers for me to actually

124
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,580
go into into tech one otherwise and I

125
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,160
saw other very capable people around me

126
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,140
and if I were I graduated from it with a

127
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,410
degree in electrical engineering in the

128
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,140
mid-1980s the most popular profession

129
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,750
amongst those who graduated with me with

130
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,820
accounting not electrical engineering

131
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,830
not computer science and it tells you

132
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,140
what it was like then it's improved

133
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,620
since then that was a pretty pivotal

134
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,690
point for me thank you I'm Dave champion

135
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,190
when you put together the slide you get

136
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,840
the privilege of picking which picture

137
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,570
you get to put up I felt like that

138
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:42,549
represented me best especially my

139
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:44,290
hairline i VP of infrastructure at

140
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,300
Netflix basically everything to do with

141
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,800
our technical infrastructure from script

142
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:53,350
to screen for on-prem and your Prem

143
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,660
networks and systems I would say and

144
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:59,140
this may be a slight repeat from last

145
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:02,560
time but when I was in high school I

146
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,120
managed to score a coop at bristol-myers

147
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,740
Squibb at the pharmaceutical companies

148
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,620
something that mostly college kids would

149
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:13,600
get and they put me in in helpdesk and

150
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,220
for those of you who know me you can

151
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,620
imagine that that really didn't end very

152
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,410
well someone calling me and asking me to

153
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:24,700
fix their printer was not what my career

154
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,890
was destined to do and so I was not

155
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,920
necessarily the best person at that job

156
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,360
but my manager saw something in me and I

157
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,400
was really interested in what the

158
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,980
network folks were up to and he let me

159
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,690
go and kind of shadow them and the rest

160
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:42,020
is history for me

161
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:45,230
Julia Thanks my my god you're beautiful

162
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:48,140
hi everyone my name is Julia my pronouns

163
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,120
are they in them and I've been working

164
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,450
at Netflix for about a year and a half

165
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,190
and this feels a little bit like a cheap

166
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,520
shot but the person that comes to mind

167
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:02,240
for me is Wade Davis whom I'm replacing

168
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,570
on this panel and you know I meant about

169
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,400
a decade ago when we were working with

170
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:10,400
LGBTQ young people and we both thought

171
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,739
that we were there to educate those

172
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,380
young folks and we realized that in fact

173
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,830
we both had a lot to learn and so we he

174
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,560
modeled for me what it was to send her

175
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,690
other folks in the in inclusion work

176
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,400
right and say for instance like he

177
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,740
really champions women and he is

178
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,080
obviously not a woman and so that really

179
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:34,190
underscored a lot of my inspiration for

180
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,870
my career thank you cool thank you I'm

181
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,270
Vijay Gill I'm the head of engineering

182
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,360
for data bricks which does large-scale

183
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,419
distributed data processing spark AI

184
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,490
machine learning so on so forth the

185
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,790
pivotal movement I think came from me

186
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:54,200
was is Lee Howard here in the audience

187
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:56,360
anywhere near word that's okay he's not

188
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,920
yeah so I'm outside a couple of months

189
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,110
ago they took a chance on me Lee Howard

190
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,200
and Doug iron were the hiring managers

191
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:09,800
at you unit and I had no idea what I was

192
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,050
doing completely I was off the rails I

193
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,460
was a pretty demonic creature back then

194
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:18,290
looking back and they they hired me and

195
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,060
that basically they took a chance on me

196
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,340
for somebody with no background and no

197
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,380
kind of I was a computer science and a

198
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,539
math major not a networking I knew

199
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,950
nothing they took a chance gave me a

200
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,860
bunch of key ones in a couple of

201
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:33,289
circuits and let me lose and from there

202
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,650
I kind of like went into this business

203
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:40,069
and the biggest learning for me was at

204
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:42,049
unit talking to louima makers and Mike

205
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,010
Odell and they taught me that at scale

206
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:49,740
and you have you can't run systems you

207
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:52,080
have to build systems that one systems

208
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,270
and that kind of metacognition kind of

209
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,620
just exploded my head and I've been kind

210
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:00,420
of running around in this space ever

211
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,440
since thank you thank you hello my name

212
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,000
is Rami Rahim

213
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,810
I am juniper CEO so almost to the day 23

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,540
years ago I graduated from Stanford came

215
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,089
across a little startup company called

216
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,680
Juniper Networks that had a pretty

217
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:21,450
audacious goal that I thought was pretty

218
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,479
exciting they took a bit on me and 23

219
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,160
years later five years ago I had the

220
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,200
honor and privilege of taking on the CEO

221
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,060
role but actually half of my career at

222
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,720
Stanford juniper was in or has been in

223
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:39,869
developing products systems software and

224
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,959
silicon many people have had a very

225
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,730
pivotal influence on my career I've

226
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,109
moved around quite a lot and grown

227
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,040
through the organization as you might

228
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,959
imagine I should however mention that

229
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,969
when I moved to Silicon Valley from

230
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:59,279
Toronto prior to going to Stanford I my

231
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,550
ambition and my goal was to get into

232
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,160
computer graphics and there was one

233
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,319
person in fact a professor that happens

234
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,709
to be on this panel that kicked my ass

235
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,779
and networking and ultimately got me to

236
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:15,569
see a little bit of the light in terms

237
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,950
of the challenges that had to be solved

238
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,200
for the networking demand that I thought

239
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,610
were really interesting exciting and I

240
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,839
think that definitely had an influence

241
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,250
on my decision to enter into the field

242
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,230
it's fun to hear these stories and how

243
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:32,670
they all kind of come back home in one

244
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:34,290
way or the other one you know what I

245
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,240
want to do just to frame the panel real

246
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,160
quick the master of efficiency pointed

247
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,820
out mister mister Gil pointed out that I

248
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,829
should do this

249
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,570
I think it's a great idea she's just say

250
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:43,829
what I want everyone in this room to get

251
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,120
out of this panel and what I want the

252
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:49,829
panelists to get out of it the the key

253
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,230
thing here for people in this room

254
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:53,819
especially is how do we help our

255
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,140
attendees grow all right so how do we

256
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,800
help our members the people in this room

257
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,750
grow and find you know if they are you

258
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,699
know looking to get into greater

259
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,220
technical leadership people leadership

260
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:06,530
things like

261
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,200
we also want to talk about how you can

262
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,439
all help get new people both into this

263
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,490
room and into your organization's and

264
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,350
help also evolve

265
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,810
Nanuk where you know where it makes

266
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,960
sense they certainly would love to hear

267
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,239
your opinions with us so this panel be

268
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,040
relatively conversational I'll ask a

269
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,110
couple of direct questions but anyone is

270
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,140
welcome to to jump in whenever you'd

271
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,090
like also happy to accept questions from

272
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,920
the audience at any point in time so if

273
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,150
you want to ask a question you don't

274
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,790
have to wait till the end get up way

275
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:43,490
that the mic and I'll find a spot to get

276
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:45,349
you in there so let me ask first Nick

277
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,240
what are the big trends that you're

278
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,060
seeing in education you've given me a

279
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,640
number about a 500% increase in CS

280
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:56,630
students yeah as of late what's up with

281
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,390
that yeah you know I see sort of three

282
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:02,360
parts of the the sausage-making Factory

283
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,340
of how we have we create new new new

284
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,760
engineers or new people that might be in

285
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:10,220
this room and one part is how do we

286
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,130
train how do we train the current

287
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,510
generation of networking students and as

288
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,710
you might imagine most of that is

289
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,810
heading towards software because we're

290
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,180
expecting that there's going to be a

291
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,920
much larger fraction of time in

292
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,530
development of software maybe I'll come

293
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:29,030
back to that a little bit later though

294
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:31,069
where we've seen the most growth and it

295
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,470
is in the number of students who are

296
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,090
choosing to major in computer science

297
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,310
you've probably heard stories about this

298
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,080
already at Stanford we've seen over a

299
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,849
five hundred percent increase in the

300
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,130
number of students declaring computer

301
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,860
science as a major in the last seven

302
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:49,130
years now universities tank change very

303
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,780
fast so a 500% increase meant that

304
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,900
computer science went from being the

305
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,030
third largest major to now three times

306
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,430
as big as the second largest major in

307
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:00,439
that short time it's a dramatic change

308
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,390
nearly every university in the country

309
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,010
is seeing the same thing so there's a

310
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,780
massive increase now many of those

311
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,700
students are going into AI n machine

312
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:11,030
learning and so maybe they won't end up

313
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,760
in this room but there is of course an

314
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:15,329
increase all across the board and so

315
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,549
we've seen now

316
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:20,128
with over a thousand students in it in

317
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:22,829
them this is kind of startling at a

318
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:25,980
relatively small university where our

319
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:28,529
incoming class is only 1,700 and we have

320
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,809
one thousand in a single class so it is

321
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:33,420
a bit strange and we're trying to adapt

322
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:36,149
it one thing that we've seen is though

323
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,259
the student body itself who are studying

324
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,779
computer science

325
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:41,699
is becoming more diverse we have much

326
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,339
better numbers in terms of the

327
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:47,508
male-female ratio which has gone from a

328
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:51,660
extremely awful pathetic low point in

329
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:53,879
2007 as around 10% of female computer

330
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,389
science students today it hovers around

331
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:59,939
about 38 percent so in 12 years so as

332
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:01,619
the student body has grown so has not

333
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,569
only the number but the fraction of

334
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:05,759
female students who are choosing to to

335
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:08,579
major in computer science we take that

336
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,100
as very encouraging but it's still got a

337
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:12,748
long way a long way to go and I would

338
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,429
say even at this point it's not a very

339
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:16,439
solid number and that it way that's

340
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:20,160
right and so where we have a lot more

341
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:24,689
work a lot more work to do nationally

342
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,540
the picture is not quite so rosy there's

343
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:29,669
still about an 8020 ratio between men

344
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,860
and women going into computer science

345
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:34,049
Computer Engineering there was a study

346
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,569
from the CRA last year computer research

347
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:40,019
Association sort of indicating that that

348
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:43,110
has is continuing so clearly nationwide

349
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:48,209
we have all what to do what's perhaps

350
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:51,809
even more that were discouraging I think

351
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:53,638
is that we don't really do a good job

352
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:55,259
nationally of tracking the number of

353
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,730
underrepresented minorities that are

354
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,889
going into computer science it's

355
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,829
actually very hard to get good numbers

356
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,419
and once if you're not even taking the

357
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,248
metrics and not even studying the

358
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,350
numbers then you can't really be doing a

359
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:13,079
very thoughtful job so we clearly have a

360
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:14,540
lot of work to do there as well what do

361
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:19,410
you think about that what do you think

362
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:22,049
contributes to that gap 8020 number yeah

363
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,439
a great question well I think part of it

364
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:25,699
is in terms of the difficulty with

365
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,868
measuring

366
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:29,209
right is that I think we have to

367
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:30,980
actually expand our categorizations

368
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:33,138
right so for instance thinking about

369
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,109
gender right like let's think about all

370
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:38,899
genders not only men and women right but

371
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:41,299
I think it's beyond that I think for

372
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:44,779
those of us in this room it requires

373
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:46,429
that we signal to students that we

374
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,809
actually want them right and that they

375
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:50,119
can do this and I think that that

376
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:52,249
requires us to sort of reimagine what

377
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:55,249
intelligence looks like right reimagine

378
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:57,069
but what is smart who gets to own what

379
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:59,629
knowledge looks like right is it is it

380
00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:02,118
certain universities right if you're if

381
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:05,119
you're networks that you pull from when

382
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:07,160
you hire right reflect you then I think

383
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,079
it you know if I'm a student who's just

384
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,809
starting college and I don't see myself

385
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:12,049
represented or maybe I met at an HBCU

386
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:14,600
right

387
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:16,699
and I don't see folks recruiting from my

388
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,379
school I think that that signals right

389
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:21,258
that I can't succeed so I think it's

390
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:23,540
it's on us to really reimagine what that

391
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:25,459
intelligence looks like and source from

392
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,899
places that have not historically sort

393
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:32,419
of been recruited from and you know if

394
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,859
we think about education what are there

395
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:35,389
things that that can be done this is

396
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,609
just a general questions about to the

397
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:40,009
whole panel things that can be done that

398
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:42,289
people in this room can do others that

399
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:44,569
or you know can encourage their peers to

400
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:47,389
do to bring more people in you know

401
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:49,699
regardless of who they are to this

402
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:51,619
industry in an earlier point to to your

403
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:54,378
point Nick people are really thinking

404
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:56,089
differently about what majors they're

405
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,189
going to take but they're going into

406
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:59,989
whatever the current hotness is more

407
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:01,868
than you know thinking about what

408
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:05,199
infrastructure underpins that hotness

409
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:07,579
there are certainly things that we can

410
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,380
certainly things that we can do one

411
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,388
thing that we've started to do is to an

412
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,149
outreach program to high school students

413
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:15,648
and particularly outside of the United

414
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:17,688
States there's about a million new jobs

415
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:19,908
in computer science every year around

416
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:22,549
the world nearly all of those are in the

417
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:24,380
US China and India over-represented in

418
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:27,679
fact and so there's a lot of the world

419
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,730
that is is actually falling further and

420
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,720
further behind in terms of

421
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:34,129
representation in our field and so it's

422
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,389
it's very hard to break out of that

423
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:36,350
because there's a obviously a

424
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:39,409
snowballing effect

425
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,459
works in both directions and so we've

426
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,169
been working teaching high school

427
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,080
students in a number of different

428
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:47,360
countries particularly Turkey the Czech

429
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,850
Republic and bogota-colombia and this

430
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,320
year adding Nairobi in Kenya where we

431
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,389
teach high school students who otherwise

432
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,770
have had no experience of computer

433
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:58,299
science they only know how to switch on

434
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,559
a computer and so what we've seen is a

435
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:02,690
big increase in the number of students

436
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,660
who then move to one to study computer

437
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,910
science in university in those countries

438
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,770
and it read taught me a lesson actually

439
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,270
which is if you expose students to

440
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,980
something that they otherwise wouldn't

441
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,740
have experienced both will have never

442
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:19,370
met an engineer most of them don't know

443
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,200
what software is there on their app on

444
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,699
their phone with their apps but they

445
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,880
have no experience of what it means to

446
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,980
create it and perhaps for us given how

447
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,159
familiar we are with that it's easy to

448
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:34,370
forget actually what that what that

449
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:37,190
onboarding process looks like and so one

450
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:40,459
thing that you can do like we're trying

451
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,110
to do too is go in talk to high school

452
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,750
students middle school students at

453
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:47,209
universities sorry at schools there will

454
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,860
be a school near you where there will be

455
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,330
students who have probably never met an

456
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,309
engineer doesn't know what an engineer

457
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,830
does go and tell them about what you do

458
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:56,658
why it excites you how you got into it

459
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,149
maybe offer to mentor them

460
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:01,220
maybe one day write them a letter write

461
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,419
just all those small what really kind of

462
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,309
small steps and I think one of the

463
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:08,990
things you'll find is there's a just

464
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:12,860
that body is open can I ask that yep or

465
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,600
so and I mean as with other large tech

466
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,539
companies in the valley and elsewhere I

467
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:21,889
mean obviously recruiting from schools

468
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:24,350
from universities is in a really amazing

469
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,700
way of increasing the diversity of our

470
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:29,178
organization if I look at the progress

471
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,159
that's nick cited in terms of you know

472
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:33,549
who's choosing technical degrees

473
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:36,350
computer science we tap into that

474
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:38,780
completely agree with starting early and

475
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,969
in fact juniper has gone beyond just

476
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,700
colleges and form partnerships with

477
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:46,010
schools like Cristo Rey high school in

478
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,320
San Jose that serves you know

479
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,820
underserved communities out there and we

480
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,010
bring him in we even give him intern

481
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,750
ships adjure burn so that starting early

482
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:56,330
is really important and I'd even double

483
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,040
down on that and say you know the

484
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,620
question was asked earlier who was

485
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:05,000
pivotal in your career or in your life

486
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,709
and choosing a career in tech for me one

487
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,460
of the most pivotal people was my father

488
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,440
who had a very young age instilled in me

489
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,020
this sort of sense of curiosity and

490
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,720
wanting to get into technology and I I

491
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,850
find myself right now with my kids

492
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,580
extra conscious because I think right

493
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:25,100
now we are we live in a society and a

494
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:28,070
culture where boys are encouraged to

495
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,199
take on to expose themselves to

496
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,000
computers and robots and so forth

497
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,710
and that has a lasting impact and

498
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,840
lasting effect and I think things are

499
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,210
improving but not as much as they need

500
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,129
to improve and I am extra conscious of

501
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,790
the conversation we have at our dinner

502
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,110
table with my boy and my girl around the

503
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,670
decisions that they make in the rest of

504
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,949
their life so I just think it starts

505
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:54,440
really early and we should be conscious

506
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:57,050
of that did you yeah I've taught a lot

507
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,960
about this a couple of things that I've

508
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:03,169
done personally myself is to go out and

509
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,910
talk at colleges talk at schools and

510
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,130
talk about the experience talk about how

511
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:12,050
you got started one of the things that

512
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:15,650
I've noticed is where you end up depends

513
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:19,370
a lot from where you start so there is a

514
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:23,840
gradient against URM underrepresented

515
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:27,050
minorities and women mostly as Rami

516
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,770
mentioned from very early age and then

517
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:32,750
the second part is that especially in

518
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,870
schools like that feed into Stanford or

519
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:38,210
that feed into Harvard or Berkeley

520
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:41,360
you've already pre-selected like a huge

521
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:43,360
variety sorry a selection of folks that

522
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,159
are already kind of like of a type

523
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,560
normally tend to be on the wealthier

524
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,300
spectrum and tend to have a set of

525
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,409
advantages when they started out earlier

526
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:57,740
so I gave a talk at at a college in

527
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:00,830
India two years ago the people there

528
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:04,220
were cognitively very smart but they had

529
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:06,168
no idea how to intervene and so

530
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,990
the pass rate for those colleges was

531
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:11,809
terrible but then you look back and you

532
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:15,710
can google for for for this it's like

533
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:17,149
did classes at Stanford like CS 9 which

534
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,580
tells you how to crack a technical

535
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:21,350
interview it's not like you take that

536
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,029
interview and you become smarter it just

537
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,219
teaches you and prepares you how to

538
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:28,970
crack an interview and the same thing

539
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:32,960
there is an excellent engineering talk

540
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:35,630
at MIT called the missing semester if

541
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,000
you if you go to MIT if you already get

542
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,980
a huge head start and then you have all

543
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,409
these things that layer on that when you

544
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,659
graduate from MIT you're prepared you

545
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:48,890
have better internships and you go slide

546
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:50,600
right into top-tier companies and the

547
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,220
cycle just kind of perpetuates and

548
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,010
repeats itself so the thing that

549
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,620
concretely we can do here is more

550
00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:00,169
apprenticeship more interns earlier

551
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,389
interns go out talk to people these

552
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:03,890
people are not stupid they're are smart

553
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:08,149
as you it's just that they started from

554
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:10,100
a different base at something you know

555
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:11,899
that yeah I think one more concrete

556
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,908
thing and thank you both I can preserve

557
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:16,070
important pieces of the puzzle is that

558
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:17,840
we have to actually make an effort to

559
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,870
diversify our personal networks as well

560
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,459
right how often do we refer a colleague

561
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,959
someone that we worked with previously

562
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,210
at a company or someone we went to

563
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,190
school with right and we do an exercise

564
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,510
at Netflix with our leaders dates

565
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,080
probably been the victim of it at least

566
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,789
one where we ask folks to really list

567
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,830
out the folks that they interact with

568
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,980
the most all right on a daily monthly

569
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:41,418
basis right and look at actually how

570
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,399
homogenous those folks are right

571
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:45,640
racially are they all married do they

572
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:48,799
all have the same kinds of GPAs etc etc

573
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,419
because if we don't make it put in the

574
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,730
actual work right and it's hard work to

575
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:54,950
diversify your network but if we don't

576
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,659
do that right and I think it's important

577
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,880
to obviously reach out to colleges and

578
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:01,130
and so forth but I think personally

579
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,159
right we have to make the investment and

580
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,809
the commitment ourselves to really get

581
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,029
to know people that we've personally

582
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:09,260
been underrepresented on underexposed to

583
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,210
right they're underrepresented because

584
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,559
we've been under exposed to them all

585
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,820
right and make those connections so that

586
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,360
we can bring them in I

587
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,429
yes I know someone I met someone I

588
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,840
mentioned historically black colleges

589
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,940
and universities a little earlier we

590
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,730
asked a bunch of leaders at Netflix to

591
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,680
go right to those colleges this year and

592
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,510
you know there's a level of discomfort

593
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,040
involved in this work because you know

594
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,110
we're not accustomed to being a minority

595
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,720
perhaps in certain spaces and I think

596
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,280
it's absolutely necessary to get

597
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,320
uncomfortable to get vulnerable to

598
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,139
really push ourselves in that network

599
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,620
expansion if we're gonna bridge this gap

600
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:49,730
absolutely so let's let's fast-forward a

601
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,649
little bit I'm I'm a graduate of Mbit

602
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,450
which is the middle bucks Institute of

603
00:24:51,650 --> 00:25:00,250
Technology which I believe is somehow

604
00:24:53,450 --> 00:25:04,940
related to MIT okay that joke failed so

605
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:07,580
how when people are ready to enter the

606
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,770
workforce how should we start thinking

607
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,230
about like how do we get people here how

608
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:15,290
do we get people to think about networks

609
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,510
how do we get them away from you know

610
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,500
not to say and I'm sure VJ you'll have

611
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,900
something to say about this

612
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,550
ai and MLM things like that there are

613
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,560
certainly reasons why those are relevant

614
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,149
to networks but that today is like the

615
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,909
hotness that I'm sure Nick is hearing

616
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,290
about non-stop at Stanford it's really

617
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,910
easy to connect with that not

618
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,440
necessarily easy to connect with the

619
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,240
infrastructure that underpins all of

620
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,650
that I don't get people interested in

621
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,770
that infrastructure so we can get them

622
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:41,900
in this room so one thing that we're

623
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,480
doing so firstly there was some stats

624
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:49,040
recently brought out by the uptight

625
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,870
uptime Institute that stated that 10% of

626
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,730
managers in the data center industry had

627
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,570
zero women on their design construction

628
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:58,580
engineering team and something like 58

629
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,280
percent had less than 10 percent women

630
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,590
so there's a fundamental gap there one

631
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,420
of the things that because for our

632
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,189
industry to work we need it across the

633
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,740
board and obviously the lens that I have

634
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,270
is the data center space and so what

635
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,950
we're doing is we're teaming with the

636
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,050
likes of the Northern Virginia Community

637
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,240
College to be able to provide job

638
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,280
shadowing so that people youngsters in

639
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,200
high school can figure out they don't

640
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,970
even know that this industry exists and

641
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,190
I think that's one thing as well that's

642
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,250
tasked that we all need to take on board

643
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,100
is how do we advocate for the

644
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:33,370
industry and help people know that it

645
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,199
that it exists and and so certainly

646
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,669
teaming up at the colleges is absolutely

647
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,560
crucial but I think providing that

648
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:42,100
grassroots level and then when we do get

649
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,720
people into our industry and they're at

650
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,770
the entry level I think one of the

651
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,060
biggest challenges that we're seeing is

652
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:52,480
what's called the broken rung of the

653
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:54,879
ladder and with women how do we get

654
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,160
women past the the first rung of the

655
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,750
ladder because what we're finding is

656
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,910
while men and women come on boards

657
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,310
within our industry at kind of equal

658
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:06,160
levels when it gets to the manager level

659
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:09,460
it starts to fall off and only 68

660
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,560
percent of women make it to the next

661
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,420
level whereas obviously hundred percent

662
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,010
of of the equivalent of the men do so

663
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,260
that's just a challenge that we're

664
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,540
trying to focus on as well how do we get

665
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,510
people to the next level because I think

666
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:25,060
we are seeing improvements at the

667
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:32,980
c-suite level but we've got to feed the

668
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:36,790
pipeline I would say you know engineers

669
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:38,920
are driven by purpose and driven by

670
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:42,700
mission that they feel excited about and

671
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:46,030
I think that's the that's the thing that

672
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:49,120
we need to hone in on as we look to

673
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:53,620
solve the very legitimate problem of

674
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,780
making networking an appealing field for

675
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,570
young technologists and engineers to

676
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:01,090
choose as a career and I you know I I've

677
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,879
honed this practice over the years a

678
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,290
Juniper by necessity you know if you

679
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,630
think about it from the standpoint of

680
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:09,820
plumbing I mean honestly to me plumbing

681
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:14,440
is actually an exciting thing but to

682
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:17,020
many it's not going above the plumbing

683
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,420
into what you enable into the purpose

684
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,680
behind what we do what we drive the

685
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,780
things that would be literally

686
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,030
impossible the fact that you know

687
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,340
networks are not for email and cat

688
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:30,160
videos these days it's it's something

689
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,320
our lives are our livelihood our health

690
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,840
depends on the kinds of things that

691
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,399
happens over these products and the

692
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,800
solutions and the networks that we're

693
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,600
building that tends to have a much

694
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,700
better chance of success

695
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,850
I would argue that cat videos are

696
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:50,230
imperative to our mental health I'm not

697
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:52,840
going to debate that actually so what

698
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,400
are either Nick or anyone else would

699
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:58,120
like to answer what are the big trends

700
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,860
so student comes in they say hey it's a

701
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,439
Romney's point I want to be an internet

702
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:06,159
plumber what what do we teach them now

703
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:12,130
because it's not compte router bgp bla

704
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:14,200
what is it now so yeah that there's two

705
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,720
answers to this there's there's one that

706
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,370
I weigh in which I wish we could answer

707
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,440
which is to say what I wish we were

708
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,090
doing and that which we are really still

709
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,490
doing because it's quite hard to change

710
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,820
the way in which we teach the next

711
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:29,950
generation because it's a moving target

712
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:33,129
but everyone in this room is aware that

713
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:35,590
the networking industry and every aspect

714
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,980
of it is changing very fast it looks so

715
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:41,350
different from how it did 12 or 15 years

716
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,140
ago and so we're trying to figure out

717
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:46,030
how to prepare the students for 10 or 12

718
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,800
15 20 years in the future

719
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:51,420
who the hell actually knows what that's

720
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:56,050
going to look like but we can guess and

721
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,900
so when students come in we try still to

722
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:01,419
give them a good grounding in systems

723
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:03,100
software it's more software focused

724
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,560
today in terms of the education and the

725
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,750
teaching more hands-on exercises giving

726
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,860
them a chance to build a piece of the

727
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,900
network for themselves

728
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:14,639
our introductory networking class at

729
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:18,090
Stanford which is in transition itself

730
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,640
currently we have them in software build

731
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:23,530
bits of TCP they build a router they

732
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,950
build other pieces and then they string

733
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:29,230
it together over time my guess is that

734
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,000
that will write up a little bit and so

735
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,710
they will think of it as something or we

736
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,420
would like them to think of the network

737
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,880
as something they program as a platform

738
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,980
for where they're expressing a behavior

739
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,290
it gets partitioned and compiled down to

740
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,910
run on these elements and they're

741
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:45,670
essentially building a programmable

742
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:48,550
system which is a large distributed

743
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:51,280
system in its own in its own right so

744
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:53,730
how do you prepare students for that do

745
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,680
you dispense with the BGP

746
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,300
the seven layer model all of those

747
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,740
things that we learn when we were

748
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,440
learning about networking well there's

749
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,840
some extent you have to because there

750
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,520
isn't time to do that and do justice to

751
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,500
the things in the future so what do you

752
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,990
throw out from what do you keep so I

753
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,880
think you'll see that that our classes

754
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:15,540
and at other universities is trying to

755
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,610
boil it down to the essence and we will

756
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,320
get it wrong sometimes for sure and we

757
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,419
will learn as we go but we think we

758
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,580
spent a lot of time thinking about this

759
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:29,850
and how to prepare that next generation

760
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,470
do you how much of you know do you see

761
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,750
people coming in who want to think about

762
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,570
a bigger picture more than the in depth

763
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,590
technicals of it like and do you see

764
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,419
those students come through where

765
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,459
they're coming through CS but more

766
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,980
theoretical CS or more business years

767
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,220
yes so I see this very limited

768
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:50,160
population at Stanford students so they

769
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,020
are both broad and deep and they're the

770
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,550
smartest people in the place right so we

771
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,040
we learn more from them than they learn

772
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:58,620
from us and so they're not particularly

773
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,379
representative of the Baroda the broader

774
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:07,979
tech population or those they're going

775
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:11,850
in so the but the desire to build stuff

776
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,950
is still very strong I think we

777
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,030
sometimes fear that the you know when we

778
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,040
went from the generation that built

779
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:20,280
radios to the generation the road

780
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,600
software we were still building stuff we

781
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,970
were just building stuff in a different

782
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,350
way and so that tinkering building stuff

783
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,000
that works for which you can get that

784
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:29,310
gratification and we all know you can

785
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,630
get you can get quicker gratification

786
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:33,419
from software building something in

787
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,970
software than our way and so there is

788
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:39,150
that is alive and strong so I take that

789
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:41,520
as a very good sign and so this desire

790
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:45,150
to build build things and see the

791
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,970
consequences of it one anecdote that I

792
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:50,900
made I share is that in addition to the

793
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:54,230
greater diversity of our student body

794
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:57,820
the reason that they're going into

795
00:32:54,230 --> 00:33:00,010
computer science is changing as well

796
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,600
it used to be if a student came to my

797
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,550
office hour and I would ask them why

798
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,050
they got into computer science they were

799
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:07,570
nearly always they were nearly always

800
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,280
male and they were usually the son of a

801
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,050
male engineer that was the biggest

802
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,820
predictor like with doctors the biggest

803
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,800
predictor of a doctor is that the son or

804
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,060
daughter of a doctor and that was

805
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,889
because they had that experience and

806
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,030
they knew actually that as an engineer

807
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:21,580
you get to do something different every

808
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,990
day right it's always new challenges and

809
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,320
new bride unless you've had that

810
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:28,510
experience you don't know that now that

811
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,580
student is typically someone who comes

812
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,860
in with an interest in science and

813
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,300
mathematics who is looking to do

814
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,330
something useful

815
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:39,850
it may be social good it may be building

816
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:42,939
a better internet it may be but they've

817
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,949
actually got the the application in mind

818
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,710
and of what they want to do with it

819
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:50,550
that is a very notable change in the

820
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,600
last ten years as far as we can set and

821
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:53,830
there are a lot more interesting as a

822
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,350
consequence because they've got a much

823
00:33:53,830 --> 00:34:00,010
broader set of interests and reasons for

824
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:02,320
doing it so what you've described as far

825
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:04,000
as what people you know we know that

826
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,710
there are companies in the room like

827
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,590
Google and Facebook and even Netflix

828
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:10,330
some extent Amazon others who hire

829
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,060
directly out of the pipeline of students

830
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:16,060
that you you turn out for lack of a

831
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,469
better word and there are also a lot of

832
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,480
people in this room who think about

833
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:22,509
things who have come up in this industry

834
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,040
over the last 10 20 30 years and think

835
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,440
about things very differently from the

836
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,389
way that you're training students who

837
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,070
come out now how do we evolve the

838
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,699
careers of the people who work for us

839
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,950
today

840
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:34,509
as we start talking about you know

841
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:37,750
intent-based networking and things like

842
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:39,490
that how do we get them there so we're

843
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,199
not leaving people behind how do we make

844
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,489
sure that these people who we've

845
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,040
invested whether they're in our

846
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:46,600
corporate culture or otherwise we don't

847
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,699
leave them behind and you know just

848
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:54,489
default to let's you know take new

849
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:56,500
people out of the pipeline sure yeah I

850
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,609
mean I think the number one thing is

851
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,950
that we have to be actively

852
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:02,020
interrogating our biases right at every

853
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,879
every step and that's quite an

854
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,590
uncomfortable thing and I think the

855
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,000
first step is actually getting really

856
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,710
comfortable with the fact that we have

857
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,099
biases against certain groups of folks

858
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:15,500
and I would say you know for leaders as

859
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:17,210
well as everyone else you know get

860
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,650
really comfortable sharing those moments

861
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,650
when you recognize it's happening with

862
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,359
friends a family wherever you can do it

863
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,670
safely so that we get because really you

864
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,730
can't wrestle with that and overcome it

865
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:30,770
and get to that goal unless you start

866
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:36,140
with really actively interrogating them

867
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:40,480
and owning them and speaking yeah so I

868
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:45,200
think the biggest risk for any company

869
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,390
including a company like juniper is the

870
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,290
resistance of its employee base to

871
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:53,950
change in an industry that is changing

872
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:56,570
rapidly and so if you think about my job

873
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:59,569
one of the most important elements of my

874
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:03,349
job is to ensure that we as a company

875
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:05,570
overcome that resistance so I had a VP

876
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:09,050
leadership off-site just two weeks ago

877
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:10,550
and in front of all the Worldwide VP

878
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:12,800
population in juniper I basically

879
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:15,890
challenging them I said I need you to do

880
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,630
two things one is to ensure that you're

881
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,879
embracing the change and you're picking

882
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:22,550
up the skills that are necessary to

883
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:27,710
protect the future of this company and

884
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:29,750
two is to look at inclusion and

885
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,910
diversity not as an imperative that's

886
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,650
led by HR or something that you're doing

887
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,839
because I'm telling you to but because

888
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:40,190
it's scientifically proven to improve

889
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:42,920
the success rate of this company so I

890
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:46,400
think ultimately today we live in a

891
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,740
world where everybody has the resources

892
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,030
to better themselves to learn new skills

893
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:54,859
new capabilities but it's the overcoming

894
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:59,000
the mental barriers or resistance to

895
00:36:54,859 --> 00:37:03,680
change the complacency that is often too

896
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,540
easy to embrace change and learn new

897
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,080
things that will allow you to stay ahead

898
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:10,580
of the curve and ultimately to win would

899
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,400
you have advice for someone in the room

900
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,140
who wanted to invest in that change

901
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,820
themselves whether their employer was

902
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,190
interested in making that change or not

903
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,740
they wanted to grow how where would they

904
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,910
start yeah I mean so this is where you

905
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,180
know

906
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:27,819
juniper itself has all sorts of you they

907
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,069
have university tuition programs and and

908
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:32,680
and courses that will help in sort of

909
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:37,058
learning your skills etc but I also

910
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:39,129
would say that there are such a wealth

911
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:41,980
and a breadth of information and

912
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:45,670
resources that are out there for people

913
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:49,990
to tap into for either no cost or very

914
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:52,270
low cost that anybody has the ability to

915
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:55,359
tap into and so what will distinguish

916
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:57,250
those that are ultimately able to make

917
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,259
the transition to make the pivot to

918
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,700
better themselves to be more effective

919
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,490
leaders in the future in those and don't

920
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:07,029
is gonna be very much about the

921
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:10,209
initiative the ambition the courage that

922
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:16,480
those individuals have to tap into those

923
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:19,030
resources in my opinion look like yes

924
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,970
change is hard right so the first part

925
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,260
is accepting change most people here by

926
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,689
the virtue of being here have been

927
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:28,839
successful for a long time at their

928
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:33,000
careers and jumping off into a different

929
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:35,770
mode where they may face failure is

930
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,079
psychologically daunting right I mean we

931
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:41,049
should acknowledge that but as coach

932
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,049
wooden said right change is really

933
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:48,670
rarely fatal but failure to change

934
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:50,500
almost always is right and so it's worth

935
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,359
thinking about where where you're going

936
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,980
and it doesn't mean necessarily that

937
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:57,520
everybody has to kind of start learning

938
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,859
Python or C sharp to become relevant

939
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,750
there's a lot of distributed systems

940
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:04,509
knowledge underlying wealth of knowledge

941
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,400
as Romney said this you have it the

942
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,220
industry has it how do you synthesize

943
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:15,029
all of that and then kind of build build

944
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:18,759
the future with that is going to be the

945
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:21,880
step forward sitting and like kind of

946
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:25,450
covering your ears is probably not going

947
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,710
to be useful and we've seen that happen

948
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,879
right I mean I've been out of the

949
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,789
networking industry for a couple of

950
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,329
years I came back and it's like wow this

951
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:35,440
is so much has changed so fast it is

952
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:40,530
amazing

953
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,530
so do that I would leave you with that

954
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:49,900
one thing that I've definitely wrestled

955
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,760
with over the years with with my staff

956
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,280
and even myself personally is that

957
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,829
tension that we have between I want to

958
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,690
be a leader in the space so I want you

959
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:00,099
know I think that I'm I think I'm one of

960
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,599
the smartest people in the room so I

961
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:05,230
should have a big say in whatever the

962
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:08,349
architecture is and you know I I confuse

963
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,089
that with being the leader so that I'm

964
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:13,480
leading people or I'm leading a business

965
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:15,520
function how do we guide people who look

966
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,119
at career growth and want to try to make

967
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,579
that decision

968
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:20,319
do you know deciding between what I want

969
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:22,030
to be an engineering leader do I want to

970
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,250
be management do I want to be a

971
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:27,819
technical leader am i principle how do I

972
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:30,069
think about that I don't forget

973
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:31,779
vignettes or you're violently shaking

974
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:33,009
your head to go oh yeah this is because

975
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,640
this is a topic that's near and dear

976
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:37,990
first I mean I'd say you know Jennifer

977
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,000
we have a technical track and a

978
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:42,098
management track in it and if we and I'm

979
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,289
sure that's not unique in this industry

980
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:49,599
if we as leaders make our engineers feel

981
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:51,819
that the only way for them to be in

982
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,890
positions of influence is for them to

983
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:56,529
manage teams and we've obviously failed

984
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:59,828
them and so we have to make sure that

985
00:40:56,529 --> 00:41:02,170
they have the seat at the table the

986
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:04,059
positions of influence the exposure to

987
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:06,940
setting strategy and making meaningful

988
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:09,039
decisions even if they choose a track

989
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,079
that's not people oriented and I want to

990
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,940
just actually maybe say a couple more

991
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:14,980
things about this which is that you know

992
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,470
I've had the experience now a Juniper

993
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,690
where I've I've worked for many years as

994
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:21,368
an engineer and then I switched over to

995
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,869
what we call a Juniper the dark side the

996
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:24,460
business side of things and then

997
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:28,630
ultimately made my way through the ranks

998
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:32,140
to this position I use my technical

999
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:34,869
skills in this job very often and

1000
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,879
obviously juniper is a tech technology

1001
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:38,829
company so you would say that's pretty

1002
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,680
intuitive but I think in the future

1003
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:45,220
every company is a technology company of

1004
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,509
sorts increasingly and so having the

1005
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,529
technical chops you don't have to be the

1006
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,570
engineer but having tech

1007
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,550
and the ability to use technology as a

1008
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:55,310
way to help you an influence or make

1009
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,260
good sound decisions I think is really

1010
00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:01,880
important the line is blurring between

1011
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:03,530
those two tracks yeah I would add that I

1012
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,710
think the the question is also for

1013
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,870
leaders to consider what kind of

1014
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,970
leadership style they have and who their

1015
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,589
leadership style privileges and who it

1016
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:15,080
disadvantages right because I think

1017
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:17,270
women and people of color do a really

1018
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,799
good job at knowing exactly what they

1019
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,410
want or what they'd like to go for right

1020
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,760
if the deck isn't kind of stacked

1021
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:25,100
against them right so if you're a very

1022
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,890
extroverted leader and your meetings are

1023
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:30,080
very debate style right what can you

1024
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:32,060
actually do right to create an

1025
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,490
environment where there's kind of more

1026
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,140
of an equal playing field for folks

1027
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,299
where you know differences are actually

1028
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,819
valued that allows folks to ask

1029
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,340
themselves that question and to become

1030
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,080
leaders where leadership doesn't have

1031
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,330
doesn't equate like me right just

1032
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,950
because someone's like you doesn't mean

1033
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:55,069
that they're necessarily an excellent

1034
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:58,520
later it's part of a person I guess the

1035
00:42:55,070 --> 00:43:00,350
only thing that I think about when we

1036
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,670
think about the different styles whether

1037
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:04,520
it's you can done the engineering or

1038
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,530
they more the business side as we kind

1039
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,360
of bring this back to diversity and

1040
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,850
inclusion I think one thing that's worth

1041
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:13,070
noting and I heard a talk recently from

1042
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:15,049
a woman by the name of Kathy Kay who's

1043
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:17,240
the news anchor for the BBC World News

1044
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,590
and she gave a talk recently she's

1045
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,740
written a book called the confidence

1046
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:23,090
code and I think it's really important

1047
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,919
to recognize the difference in

1048
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:28,700
confidence levels between men and women

1049
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,750
and women will typically only apply for

1050
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,370
a job when there are a hundred percent

1051
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,890
confident that they have the skills to

1052
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,420
do so men will do so when they have 60

1053
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,620
percent of the skills because they feel

1054
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,560
they'll just learn the other 40 percent

1055
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:42,410
on the job so I think it's important to

1056
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,360
recognize that and and so I think

1057
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,210
there's a big focus on making sure that

1058
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,890
we're cognizant of that and then

1059
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,390
recognizing when maybe people aren't

1060
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,190
putting their hands up to maybe go

1061
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:54,529
forward for the promotion or go down the

1062
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:57,020
principle path that there is that gender

1063
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,840
difference in terms of confidence levels

1064
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,340
between both men and women it's also

1065
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,250
stated that men overstate their

1066
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:08,430
confidence level

1067
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:10,890
by 30% just a fact but we did a study a

1068
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,660
few years ago among students in our

1069
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:16,319
introductory computer science class who

1070
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:18,600
had received a B grade and so as a

1071
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:22,080
survey amongst the the men and the women

1072
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,850
who had received a B and you know at

1073
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,670
Stanford there's a lot of a ease that

1074
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:30,810
get given and so a B is not universally

1075
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:33,390
thought of as a good grade so the female

1076
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:35,580
students tended to think of this as a

1077
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:37,710
very negative I clearly I can't do

1078
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:41,520
computer science or you know I'm not cut

1079
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:44,850
out for this and the men generally said

1080
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,520
I've got this this is fine I'm good at

1081
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:49,799
this I got a B hey I'm going places and

1082
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,980
the difference in the viewpoint was

1083
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,390
quite startling and it led to a lot of

1084
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,450
reflection about the way the grading is

1085
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:03,629
done as well in terms of the confidence

1086
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:07,169
level coming in a video hi I'll be

1087
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:09,810
Freedman I have a question we know in

1088
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,970
this room that a lot of us don't have

1089
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:14,790
PhDs don't have computer science degrees

1090
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:17,790
on one class short of my degree so I

1091
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:19,770
don't have a degree and we see and we

1092
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:22,290
actually hire for people that have self

1093
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:25,100
discovered demonstrated self interest

1094
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:29,850
and sort of use the resources out there

1095
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:31,350
but I find that people from different

1096
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,660
backgrounds didn't always have the

1097
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:36,509
privilege to take the time or have the

1098
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:39,660
resources to learn that way so I'm

1099
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:42,680
wondering in the cultures specifically

1100
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:47,549
data bricks and Netflix and and juniper

1101
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,600
how you encourage people that deciding

1102
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,610
where they want to go with their career

1103
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,740
is something that they need to be able

1104
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:55,230
to articulate and drive but then you'll

1105
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:57,359
support them if they haven't had that

1106
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:59,240
kind of pattern you know from working

1107
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,230
with people and family or professionally

1108
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,200
well I'll answer first

1109
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:06,390
we very classically at Netflix used to

1110
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,910
have a culture where it was like you got

1111
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,950
hired to do a job you do that job you go

1112
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,810
home and if you are you know curious

1113
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,970
about growth you figure out that growth

1114
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:16,259
at home not in the workplace

1115
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:18,450
and it turns out that's not really

1116
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,580
sustainable long-term you who would have

1117
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:23,040
thought so we're definitely thinking

1118
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:25,319
about it more in a holistic way of how

1119
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,029
do we grow people where they are now and

1120
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,130
let them take the initiative so we're

1121
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:31,050
not necessarily saying well to get this

1122
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:33,390
new job you need to have this specific

1123
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:35,580
skill set but we are saying like if you

1124
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,890
have a career path in mind that we can

1125
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,960
accommodate and we're infamous for not

1126
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:42,420
having a ton of hierarchy so a career

1127
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,630
path for us is not from like engineer to

1128
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:48,270
engineer 3 or from the engineer 8 to

1129
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,860
principle one type of thing it is much

1130
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:51,300
more like you know how do you think

1131
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,280
about holistic Lee your long term career

1132
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:59,340
and how can we invest in that I didn't

1133
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:01,440
mean to leave DRT out sorry so I'll tell

1134
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:04,590
you that we've always encouraged the

1135
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,010
Juniper conversations we call them

1136
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,720
conversations days between managers and

1137
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,700
you know their teams are around all

1138
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,730
sorts of topics but I'll fill you in on

1139
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:17,189
one ok our objective that we're setting

1140
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:20,400
and a key result we're setting for 2020

1141
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,930
which is 100% of employees in the

1142
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,500
company we're close to 10,000 people

1143
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:28,080
will have a career objective career

1144
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,300
growth conversation with their managers

1145
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:37,500
so that they're well understood by both

1146
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:41,610
the employee and the manager so we have

1147
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:43,530
very similar approaches that Romney just

1148
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,750
mentioned plus we have an education

1149
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:47,160
budget and that we encourage people and

1150
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,740
working at the rubrics they're like

1151
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,170
three professors on staff so it's like

1152
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,839
getting your PhD dissertation defense

1153
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:57,300
every day and just showing up to work so

1154
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:00,360
kind of we try to encourage that we also

1155
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,070
have a large open source component so

1156
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,570
people and we hire from the open source

1157
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,550
community and we give back to the open

1158
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,500
source community so you get your peer

1159
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,720
feedback as well in terms of career

1160
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:15,990
growth and different directions that you

1161
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:18,270
may want to step into thank you thanks

1162
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,859
Ali I can throw it out to the audience

1163
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:22,410
for any other questions for a couple

1164
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:25,730
minutes it's curious anything about

1165
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:25,730
former panelists

1166
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:35,069
hi Susan Forney hurricane electric

1167
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:38,730
you've been talking about how important

1168
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:41,308
it is to enable you know you know

1169
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:43,400
diverse groups to get access into the

1170
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:45,749
into their careers and you know get over

1171
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,460
microaggressions and and you know and

1172
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:49,140
help them and so I thought it might be

1173
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,539
interesting to hear from each one of the

1174
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:54,240
panel members how you have done

1175
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:59,220
something in your career to enable

1176
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:01,979
another employee or a colleague to to

1177
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,859
get past some of this because as a

1178
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,809
community we only change the culture by

1179
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:08,098
you know every person participating and

1180
00:49:06,809 --> 00:49:09,599
I thought if you every one of you gave

1181
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:14,880
an example how you did it might help

1182
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:17,670
everyone sure I think I've mentioned

1183
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,009
some of these so first and foremost when

1184
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:22,829
we set up women's leadership for women's

1185
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:25,440
tech form three years ago it was because

1186
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:26,849
we felt that there wasn't an environment

1187
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,829
where the women in this industry could

1188
00:49:26,849 --> 00:49:31,799
come together and just network in a

1189
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:33,630
relaxed and safe environment so that was

1190
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:35,038
really important to us that we provided

1191
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:37,259
that we have one rule which is no

1192
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,789
selling but it brings our entire

1193
00:49:37,259 --> 00:49:41,940
industry together and it just allows

1194
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:44,849
people to to talk to each other maybe

1195
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,950
share experiences get some advice maybe

1196
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:49,289
find a mentor while you're there and

1197
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:51,239
then in addition to that a digital

1198
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:54,210
reality setting up the women's group

1199
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:56,099
there and it seems like so basic it's

1200
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:57,989
just there wasn't one there it was in

1201
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,400
there was a question asked at the one of

1202
00:49:57,989 --> 00:50:01,140
the company All Hands that says why

1203
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,910
aren't there more women in a senior

1204
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:06,420
position or indeed in any positions

1205
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:07,859
within the company and we really didn't

1206
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,680
have a great answer for that but I think

1207
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:13,319
then when we set up the really very much

1208
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,730
a grassroots effort to bring the women

1209
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:16,980
in the company together to have those

1210
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:19,739
conversations to advocate to try and

1211
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:24,059
bring more women on board I think we've

1212
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:25,289
seen a huge amount of progress over the

1213
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:29,579
last two years or so with that

1214
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:32,220
particular group um it's you know as a

1215
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:34,279
teacher it's it's what we're supposed to

1216
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:37,759
do I can't say we always do it very well

1217
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:40,010
but the the the most notable

1218
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,540
memory for me the one that really

1219
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:46,520
actually changed my life and hopefully

1220
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:48,290
change someone else's too was in 2014 we

1221
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,960
started teaching high school students in

1222
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:53,450
Istanbul and these were students for

1223
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,950
whom they had no prior knowledge of

1224
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,799
computer science it was a two-week

1225
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:59,299
intensive residential program where they

1226
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,860
get their first introduction to computer

1227
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:04,760
science and we teach them the freshman

1228
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:06,980
class that we teach at Stanford and the

1229
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,080
very first class there's a 16 year old

1230
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,540
girl that came to the class and she said

1231
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,370
to me in perfect English I have no idea

1232
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,080
why I'm here I'm not interested in

1233
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,880
computer science at all if I don't even

1234
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,290
know what it is I want to do something

1235
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:23,360
else I'm only here because my mom told

1236
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:26,290
me I have to come and she turns out she

1237
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:29,990
was the valedictorian at her school

1238
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:33,290
incredibly capable of math and science

1239
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:34,640
and had you know had no idea what

1240
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,770
engineering was she was going to go and

1241
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,690
study chemistry or physics cuz that's

1242
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:40,070
what she knew in school at the end of

1243
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:42,950
the two weeks she said now I know what I

1244
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:44,600
want to do with my career and he

1245
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:46,460
actually it brings it makes the hair or

1246
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,710
back of my neck stand up when I tell you

1247
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:50,810
this story because then she went on and

1248
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:53,810
studied computer science and came back

1249
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:58,400
and was a an assistant teacher for us a

1250
00:51:53,810 --> 00:52:00,470
couple of years later and now that's an

1251
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,750
anecdote and so we've been trying to

1252
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:05,480
figure out how to make this how to make

1253
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:08,540
this scale and the thing that it that it

1254
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,960
taught me was the sort of the the

1255
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:14,870
relatively simple way of in-person

1256
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,850
mentoring or the in-person experience we

1257
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:20,660
all saw the growth of those MOOCs the

1258
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:23,180
massive online open courses guess what

1259
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:26,359
they don't really work at bringing new

1260
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,859
people in most of the people that use

1261
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,720
those MOOCs are the people that are

1262
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:31,550
highly motivated students who are

1263
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,189
already knowledgeable of a field trying

1264
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:38,990
to brush up they're not there's only a

1265
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:41,390
5% completion rate and so as a method

1266
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:43,009
for bringing new people in it has to be

1267
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:45,170
done in person this is the conclusion

1268
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:49,100
I've come to and so we have to figure

1269
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:50,430
out how we get out to the to folks who

1270
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,680
otherwise wouldn't have

1271
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:53,730
they have that experience and that's why

1272
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:57,058
I would encourage you to try and do the

1273
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:59,849
same what I heard on the question from

1274
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:01,829
Susan was question about Ally ship and

1275
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:05,130
that's what I took away from it which is

1276
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:07,470
that how can you be better in helping

1277
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,940
people who are potentially underserved

1278
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,589
who want to get in this industry get

1279
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,880
into this industry one of the biggest

1280
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:14,038
first steps he can take in that is

1281
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,119
understanding the julia's points earlier

1282
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:19,020
in my opinion your unconscious biases I

1283
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,750
personally know that like for example

1284
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:24,630
I'm a gay man I would figure that like I

1285
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:25,950
wouldn't have the the biases I can't

1286
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,569
know I'm gender that a lot of other

1287
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:30,450
people would theoretically have but a

1288
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:32,369
straight male might have and I take

1289
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:34,439
tests I took these tests at the MIT

1290
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:35,849
thing or which wouldn't I would Harvard

1291
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,089
thank you and it was it was an Ivy

1292
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:40,980
League thing where you basically think

1293
00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:43,230
you're playing almost a game to figure

1294
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,910
out what your biases are and it turns

1295
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:47,670
out like I'm just as bad if not worse

1296
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:49,558
and then anyone else who would take that

1297
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:53,789
same test you know sexuality be damned

1298
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:55,619
and so learning that maybe go well what

1299
00:53:53,789 --> 00:53:57,809
assumptions am i making about women when

1300
00:53:55,619 --> 00:54:00,960
I'm working with them on a day to day

1301
00:53:57,809 --> 00:54:03,299
basis and how can I be better at helping

1302
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,309
them grow and am I making assumptions

1303
00:54:03,299 --> 00:54:06,750
that oh maybe they may be you know what

1304
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,920
I was taught as a child is that they

1305
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,390
don't want to grow it's just whatever

1306
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,059
like things like that which are just

1307
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:13,470
ridiculous assumptions to make that you

1308
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:15,869
don't even realize you're making but

1309
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:19,459
it's how you were brought up it's you

1310
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:21,900
know nurture just as much as nature so

1311
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:25,020
understanding to me is the is like the

1312
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:27,029
key first step for any of us I love this

1313
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,430
question so much because we all

1314
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:30,960
understand the business out of diversity

1315
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,819
right but it doesn't stick you don't

1316
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,210
retain folks unless you do the inclusion

1317
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:38,308
work and we mentioned microaggressions

1318
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,930
we did a big exercise with a bunch of

1319
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:42,059
the leaders at Netflix where we asked

1320
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:44,129
them to identify a moment in their adult

1321
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:45,390
life when they had other someone really

1322
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:48,089
committed to microaggressions for

1323
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:50,038
instance and to think through the impact

1324
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:52,589
right that that potentially seemingly

1325
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:55,049
very small moment had had on that other

1326
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:57,359
person on them on the dynamics of folks

1327
00:54:55,049 --> 00:54:59,640
around right and to actually tell this

1328
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:02,910
story to the folks that they work with

1329
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:05,220
right this is a very effective

1330
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:07,710
to actually get more comfortable in the

1331
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,399
vulnerability to own to speak hey I had

1332
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,950
this bias

1333
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,259
I saw a man walking through the hall and

1334
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:15,180
I asked him for the Wi-Fi code and and I

1335
00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:16,589
realized I made an assumption that he

1336
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,049
works here because he's not a white

1337
00:55:16,589 --> 00:55:21,269
person right actually being able to say

1338
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:23,430
what that is and to work through what

1339
00:55:21,269 --> 00:55:25,379
the impact is is a really really

1340
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:27,180
excellent tool that I recommend for all

1341
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:30,150
folks to take a better try

1342
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:33,720
you did so I'll give a concrete example

1343
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:35,940
to Susan's point and so this is at a

1344
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,890
previous company a promising search

1345
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:41,519
engine and down in Mountain View where

1346
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:43,859
we have this amazing so we were building

1347
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:47,549
a lot of a mapping right yes we were

1348
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:49,950
building a lot of hardware and optics

1349
00:55:47,549 --> 00:55:51,359
are a large component of that of the

1350
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:54,569
Bill of Materials and we had this

1351
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,819
amazing test results that kept coming

1352
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:57,839
out to us I don't know if the car is in

1353
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:01,170
this audience or not

1354
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:03,000
he knew who I'm talking about amazing

1355
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:05,130
test results on optics kept coming back

1356
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,289
from the platform group I really like

1357
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:09,480
who is this this is somebody who's

1358
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:12,660
really like buttoned up and and top

1359
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:16,829
notch and so we found out who that

1360
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:18,450
tester was and it was this PhD out of an

1361
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:21,180
optics out of Berkeley called Wendy's

1362
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:23,819
out and we were like she is just amazing

1363
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:26,149
but he had no experience whatsoever in

1364
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:28,890
networking he is actually like her

1365
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:32,849
dissertation was unlike Vic's l cavity

1366
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:34,410
resonance but her quality of work and

1367
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:37,319
the effort she put into it was so

1368
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:39,660
amazing that in death of massive

1369
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:42,390
opposition we actually interviewed her

1370
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:45,509
fast-tracked her and brought her into

1371
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:47,009
our side of the house we're in like I

1372
00:56:45,509 --> 00:56:50,190
think four or five years I think he was

1373
00:56:47,009 --> 00:56:54,000
the first superb or like very strongly

1374
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:57,000
exceeds rating in the entire group in in

1375
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,890
at least my half a decade there and now

1376
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,170
then she rose to senior staff almost

1377
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:03,269
principal at at the search engine and

1378
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:05,789
now she is running like 300 people at

1379
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:08,788
Alibaba so that was kind of like where

1380
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:11,279
we had to fight against perception no

1381
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:13,559
this is an optics tester why do you

1382
00:57:11,279 --> 00:57:14,820
think he'll be able to run or design

1383
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:17,140
networks

1384
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:22,420
if you probably did a search today

1385
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:24,220
logged off it ran over her designs an

1386
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:26,380
example of a system that I'm proud of

1387
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:29,560
that we recently put in places is a

1388
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:32,920
formal executive sponsorship program not

1389
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:35,500
mentorship but sponsorship program where

1390
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,420
sponsors are bed by definition have to

1391
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,000
be people that are in position of

1392
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:44,170
influence in the company that can make

1393
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,690
decisions that can create opportunities

1394
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:48,160
so I recruited my entire executive staff

1395
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:50,320
as well as a few more people around the

1396
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:55,000
company to become executive sponsors we

1397
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:57,520
identified around 20 or so hypo diverse

1398
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,770
candidates within the company that we

1399
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:03,900
want to see advance their careers and

1400
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:06,670
then what these sponsors do is

1401
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:09,280
essentially advocate they advocate

1402
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:12,400
especially behind closed doors when when

1403
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:17,950
the candidates or the the hypose are not

1404
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:20,380
even around for their sponsor ease and

1405
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:23,529
ultimately the end result I'm looking

1406
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,520
for is to increase the number of diverse

1407
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:26,860
promotions

1408
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:28,650
in the company and I'm actually quite

1409
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:30,790
optimistic this is gonna pay off for us

1410
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,770
okay a lightning round because we're

1411
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:34,840
over on time but I want to get this real

1412
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:39,130
quick what is the one thing you're gonna

1413
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:41,740
do in 2020 to get new faces in this room

1414
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:43,300
or whether it's this room or we just

1415
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,129
talk about this room as the industry in

1416
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:49,870
general what's one thing each of you

1417
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:51,820
will do well I think one thing that on

1418
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:54,430
behalf of women's tech forum I think we

1419
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:57,310
want to partner with Nanog we've got

1420
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:58,870
access to as I said 750 women globally

1421
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,640
who work in this industry but maybe not

1422
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,810
in this particular field and I think

1423
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,210
it's really important the way that we're

1424
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:06,190
growing to grow is by is through

1425
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:08,440
partnerships with organizations such as

1426
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:09,520
nanog so I believe the Seattle is one

1427
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,780
that we're going to target together

1428
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:15,190
awesome look we're gonna try and teach

1429
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:16,870
700 high school students in four

1430
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:18,430
different countries for their first

1431
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:20,680
experience in computer science this

1432
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:22,690
summer no idea how it will go but we'll

1433
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,899
do that as best we can

1434
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:27,280
there's a CS bridge stanford.edu will

1435
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,990
tell you about it if you want to get

1436
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,250
involved better still encourage your

1437
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:33,910
company to fund us to do it better

1438
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:35,950
please yeah I mean I'm gonna encourage

1439
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:37,899
everyone in the room to stop asking what

1440
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:39,310
underrepresented folks can do to succeed

1441
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,660
right and really flip the question and

1442
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:43,330
ask how you can create the conditions

1443
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,118
for them to thrive so two specific

1444
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:50,290
things one I've raised the

1445
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:52,480
underrepresented minority outreach for

1446
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:54,279
our internship program because like I

1447
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,990
said where you start from almost all

1448
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,580
this depends where you end up and the

1449
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:59,439
second thing is I'm going to spend

1450
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:01,509
personally a fair amount of time going

1451
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,670
around talking to schools around how to

1452
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:06,090
crack the coding interview basically I'm

1453
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:08,860
taking the Stanford CS

1454
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:10,450
and just presenting and giving that talk

1455
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:14,500
to a wider audience who are not at

1456
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:15,730
Stanford from so I one thing which is a

1457
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:18,160
sponsorship program which I'm actually

1458
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:20,170
super proud of but then the other thing

1459
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,850
that I think I'm gonna do is we're gonna

1460
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:25,180
change the composition of our

1461
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:26,830
interviewer panels to increase the

1462
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,750
likelihood of bringing in more diverse

1463
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:31,509
candidates since the company that's

1464
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:33,340
awesome I'm personally going to go visit

1465
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:36,700
